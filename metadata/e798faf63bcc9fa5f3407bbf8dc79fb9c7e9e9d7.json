A brilliant young boy, Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cutÃ¢â‚¬â€young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.\n\nEnder's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. \n\nIs Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If, that is, the world survives.\n\nSpeaker for the Dead (The Ender Quintet #2)\nThree thousand planet-bound years have fled since Ender Wiggin won humanity's war with the Buggers by totally destroying them. Ender remains young-travelling the stars at relativistic speeds, a hundred years or more might pass while he experiences a month-long voyage. In three thousand years, his books The Hive Queen and The Hegemon have become holy writ, and the name of Ender anathema; he is the Xenocide, the one who killed an entire race of thinking, feeling beings, the only other sapient race humankind had found in all the galaxy. The only ones, that is, until the planet called Lusitania was discovered and colonized.\n\nOn Lusitania humans found another race of ramen ... a young race, beings just beginning to lift their eyes to the stars and wonder what might be out there. The discovery was seen as a gift to humanity, a chance to redeem the destruction of the Buggers. And so the Pequininos, as they were named by the portuguese-speaking settlers, the &quot;Piggies,&quot; were placed off-limits to the colony. The only humans allowed to meet them and speak with them are trained xenobiologists, and then only two at a time. This time, there will be no tragic misunderstandings leading to war. This time...\n\nThis time, again, men die-bizarrely killed by the Piggies. Andrew Wiggin is called to Lusitania to Speak the deaths of the two xenobiologists, and walks into a maelstrom of fear and hatred. To Speak for these dead, he must first unravel the web of secrets surrounding the lives of the Piggies and those who study them. He must Speak not only for the dead, but for a living alien race.\n\nXenocide (The Ender Quintet #3)\nThe war for survival of the planet Lusitania will be fought in the hearts of a child named Gloriously Bright.\n\nOn Lusitania, Ender found a world where humans and pequininos and the Hive Queen could all live together; where three very different intelligent species could find common ground at last. Or so he thought.\n\nLusitania also harbors the descolada, a virus that kills all humans it infects, but which the pequininos require in order to become adults. The Starways Congress so fears the effects of the descolada, should it escape from Lusitania, that they have ordered the destruction of the entire planet, and all who live there. The Fleet is on its way, and a second xenocide seems inevitable.\n\nChildren of the Mind (The Ender Quintet #4)\nWith this conclusion to his famous &quot;Ender's Saga, &quot; Card returns to the story of Ender Wiggin, hero of the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead, and Xenocide. Now his adopted world, Lusitania, is threatened by the same planet-destroying weapon that he himself used so many years before. Only Jane, the computer intelligence that has evolved with him over 3,000 years can save the three sentient races of Lusitania.\n\n\nEnder in Exile (An interquel Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead.)\nWhat happened during the years between &quot;Ender's Game&quot; and &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;? What did Ender go through from the ages of 12 through 35? The story of those years has never been told. Taking place 3000 years before Ender finally receives his chance at redemption in &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;, this is the long-lost story of Ender. For twenty-three years, millions of readers have wondered and now they will receive the answers. &quot;Ender in Exile&quot; is Orson Scott Card's moving return to all the action and the adventure, the profound exploration of war and society, and the characters one never forgot. On one of these ships, there is a baby that just may share the same special gifts as Ender's old friend Bean...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e798faf63bcc9fa5f3407bbf8dc79fb9c7e9e9d7","amp;dn":"The+Ender+Quintet+-+Card%2C+Orson+Scott","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e798faf63bcc9fa5f3407bbf8dc79fb9c7e9e9d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,152,250,246,59,204,159,165,243,64,123,191,141,199,159,185,199,233,233,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
