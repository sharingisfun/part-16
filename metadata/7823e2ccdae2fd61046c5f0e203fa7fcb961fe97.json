Pilots are rare, and the ability to be a Pilot also entails physical wasting and a shortened life.\n\nBut Pilots live only for the timeless moments of Transition, when their ships cross the emptiness of space in an instant. Now Void Pilot Dominique Alia Wu has begun to catch a glimpse of something more, something transcendent in that eternal moment . . . and she needs the cooperation of her Captain to achieve it permanently. Even at risk to the survival of the Ship.\n\nNorman Spinrad has been one of SFÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most adventurous writers since the 1960s, an internationally praised peer of such writers as Harlan Ellison, Michael Moorcock, and Samuel R. Delany. His stories of the Second Starfaring Age, The Void CaptainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tale and the later novel Child of Fortune, form a single epic praised by the Encyclopedia of Science Fiction as Ã¢â‚¬Å“an eroticized vision of the Galaxy . . . an elated Wanderjahr among the sparkling worlds.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\nCHILD OF FORTUNE\nIn the exotic interstellar civilization of the Second Starfaring Age, youthful wanderers are known as Children of Fortune. This is the tale of one such wanderer, who seeks her destiny on an odyssey of self-discovery amid humanity's many worlds. Arresting and visionary, Child of Fortune is a science-fictional On the Road.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7823e2ccdae2fd61046c5f0e203fa7fcb961fe97","amp;dn":"The+Void+Captain%27s+Tale+%26amp%3B+Child+of+Fortune+by+Norman+Spinrad","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7823e2ccdae2fd61046c5f0e203fa7fcb961fe97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,35,226,204,218,226,253,97,4,108,95,14,32,63,167,252,185,97,254,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
