Each algorithm is customized for different types of image noise and grain, and each has separate controls associated with it.\n\nThe &quot;Coarse/Noise&quot; suppression algorithm is very similar to the algorithm used within the original DIGITAL GEM plug-in. This algorithm is very aggressive and works better for more extreme noise problems. The &quot;Fine/Grain, Noise&quot; suppression algorithm is not as aggressive, but is specifically tuned to remove grain problems, as well as noise, while preserving more detail within the image.\n\nThe KODAK DIGITAL GEM Professional Plug-In also offers a &quot;Noise Preview Screen&quot; which enables users to view just the noise or grain that they want to reduce. Adjustments can be made to define how much noise/grain versus how much image detail they want to affect. Users can then toggle back and forth between the Before screen, the After screen, and the Noise Preview screen as they make adjustments in order to see the how the plug-in will improve their image.\n\nGreater Control for Greater Results\n\nThe new &quot;Clarity&quot; controls allow users to further customize the plug-in effects by providing additional sharpening or softening to the overall image. A &quot;Radius&quot; slider is also available to control the amount of surrounding pixels that would be affected by the sharpening/softening. The higher the radius, the more dramatic the effect.\nThe KODAK DIGITAL GEM Professional Plug-In has a &quot;Blending&quot; control to mix the final noise/grain reduction effect with the original image at a range of 0% (all original) to 100% (Full plug-in effect). This is a final, fine-tuning step to achieve the most desirable result.\n\nThe KODAK DIGITAL GEM Professional Plug-In also supports the use of 16 bit color images, as well as the standard 8 bit color images.\n\nDigital GEM Airbrush Pro:\n=========================\nAutomatically Smoothes and Renews Skin Surfaces\nThe KODAK DIGITAL GEM Airbrush Professional Plug-In gives users a quick and powerful way of smoothing skin surfaces without blurring or affecting the detail of important facial features.\n\nThis plug-in enables users to achieve meticulous airbrush effects, automatically, without tedious, time-consuming masking and manual softening. The KODAK DIGITAL GEM Airbrush Professional Plug-In smoothes surfaces in digital images by reducing harsh shadows and highlights, minimizing the imperfections of skin and other surfaces, while fully preserving details like hair, eyelashes, eyebrows, and the true character of a subject's face.\n\nSeveral advanced control sliders allow users to customize the smoothing effects and intensity amounts at three levels of detail: fine, medium, and coarse. Users can preview a high contrast mask which depicts the image detail that is affected or unaffected. The plug-in provides three standard setting buttons: Normal; Lighten; and Darken, which allow the correction to be applied to only darker areas, only lighter areas, or both. The KODAK DIGITAL GEM\n\nAirbrush Professional Plug-In also supports the use of 16 bit color images, as well as the standard 8 bit color images.\n\n\nPerform Digital Makeovers Automatically\n\nThe KODAK DIGITAL GEM Airbrush Professional Plug-In provides an effective and affordable solution for the amateur snap-shooter or the professional portrait photographer to bring out the real beauty in their subjects by reducing the distracting imperfections and smoothing unflattering highlights/shadows. Whether the subjects are older with wrinkles, teens with blemishes, or toddlers with already perfect skin, this plug-in will make them look their best.\n\nDigital ROC Pro:\n================\nAutomatically Correct, Restore, and Balance Color and Contrast/Brightness of Digital Images\nKODAK DIGITAL ROC Professional Plug-In has the award-winning features and functionality to give users more control and better results for correcting and restoring the color of their digital images.\n\nThe KODAK DIGITAL ROC Professional Plug-In analyzes color gradients in the image to remove color casts or tints and restore faded or lost color by generating optimal tonal curves for each color channel. Images with color problems due to lighting conditions like fluorescent or tungsten lights, or indirect/insufficient lighting can also be automatically enhanced to reveal more pleasing, natural color by the removal of color casts or tints.\n\n\nGreater Control for Greater Results\n\nIn addition to the color correction control sliders, the KODAK DIGITAL ROC Professional Plug-In provides advanced controls for precise adjustment of both, image brightness and image contrast. These additional control features give you improved results by allowing overall image darkening or lightening, and separate black and white level adjustment for image contrast enhancement.\nImages scanned from film can be further enhanced using the plug-in's &quot;Optimize for Film&quot; checkbox which, when selected, analyzes and detects film grain patterns in the digital image color channels and corrects cross-channel color problems, resulting in a more effective color correction.\n\nThe KODAK DIGITAL ROC Professional Plug-In also supports the use of 16 bit color images, as well as the standard 8 bit color images\n\nAutomatically Reveals Hidden Details in Shadow and Highlight areas of Digital Images\nKODAK DIGITAL SHO Professional Plug-In has the award-winning features and functionality to give users more control and better results improving their digital images.\n\nKODAK DIGITAL SHO\n=================\n\nProfessional Plug-In automatically reveals details hidden in highlight/over exposed areas, as well as details hidden in the shadow/under exposed areas. Proprietary algorithms analyze and adjust the gradations of dark and light image areas to optimally reveal hidden details.\n\n\nGreater Control for Greater Result\n\nKODAK DIGITAL SHO Professional Plug-In provides separate sliders for independent highlight and shadow area control.\n\nThe plug-in also allows users to adjust the boundary which determines how much of the image is defined as shadow or highlight, and enables them to preview the black and white threshold of the image.\n\nKODAK DIGITAL SHO Professional Plug-In gives users control of overall color saturation for the newly revealed image content.\n\nUsers can also set their input type, either film or digital camera, which optimizes the plug-in's capability to retrieve image data and deliver outstanding results. The professional plug-in supports both 8-bit and 16-bit color images\n===========================================================\n----- Install notes:--------------------------------------------------------------\n===========================================================\n\n\n1:use setups to install\n2:use cracks to activate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit us for more: &lt;a href=&quot; http://storethefiles.net/signup.php?referrer=didomh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://storethefiles.net/signup.php?referrer=didomh&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32721873570c28f3348630871738f625dd43ba4d","amp;dn":"Kodak+Photography+Suite+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32721873570c28f3348630871738f625dd43ba4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,114,24,115,87,12,40,243,52,134,48,135,23,56,246,37,221,67,186,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
