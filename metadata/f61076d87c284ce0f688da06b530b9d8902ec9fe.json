Rather \r\nthan go to a private investigator to locate him, a P.I. who would use public \r\nmeans to do his work, Julia instead enlists the more discreet services of \r\nher psychic, Madame Blanche, to locate her nephew, with a payment of $10,000 \r\nupon delivery. What Julia is unaware of is that Madame Blanche - really \r\nBlanche Tyler - is a charlatan, who uses basic information of her targets \r\noften uncovered by her actor/taxi driving boyfriend, George Lumley, to \r\nperpetrate the scam. Blanche and George feel this $10,000 is their meal \r\nticket, despite having only scant leads as to the identity and whereabouts \r\nof the nephew. Their initial leads indicate that the nephew may in fact be \r\ndead... or perhaps not. In reality, the nephew is Arthur Adamson, a jeweller, \r\nwho, along with his secret associate/girlfriend Fran, have amassed their own \r\nsmall fortune through the theft of gems, largely through kidnapping the gem \r\nowners, with the said gems being the ransom paid. Arthur grew up as Edward \r\nShoebridge, the adopted son of friends of the Rainbird's chauffeur. Along \r\nwith another associate, Edward killed his parents in a house fire twenty-\r\nfive years ago, and faked his own death in the process, although he had \r\nnever been declared legally dead since there was no conclusive evidence of \r\nsuch. He assumed his current identity after the fire. When Arthur learns that \r\nthese strangers, George and Blanche, are trying to locate Edward Shoebridge \r\nbut not knowing the reason, Arthur and Fran believe it's because of their \r\nlatest kidnapping, and thus decide they need to do whatever, including murder, \r\nto keep George and Blanche from finding &quot;Eddie&quot;.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Karen Black.\r\n=&gt;-Bruce Dern.\r\n=&gt;-Barbara Harris.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Alfred Hitchcock.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Drama : Mystery : Suspense : Comedy.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1976.\r\n=&gt;-Language...................: English : French : Italian : Spanish.\r\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 2.44 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 2 907 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 2h 01mn.\r\n=&gt;-Chapters...................: 18 Named.\r\n=&gt;-Family Plot 1976...........: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/family_plot/\r\n=&gt;-Family Plot 1976...........: http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/family-plot-1976/\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 1.85:1.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1920 x 1040.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 2 444 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 157 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio French.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 140 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio Italian.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 149 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio Spanish.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 157 Kbps.\r\n\r\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English.\r\n=&gt;-French.\r\n=&gt;-Italian.\r\n=&gt;-Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f61076d87c284ce0f688da06b530b9d8902ec9fe","amp;dn":"Family+Plot+-+Alfred+Hitchcock+Thriller+1976+Eng+Fre+Ita+Spa+Mul","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f61076d87c284ce0f688da06b530b9d8902ec9fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,16,118,216,124,40,76,224,246,136,218,6,181,48,185,216,144,46,201,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
