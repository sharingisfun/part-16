Gig from 1992 from classic indie shoegaze band 'Ride'. Ripped from VHS. Chapter for each track.\n\nTracks: leave them all behind, taste, not fazed, unfamiliar, like a daydream, OX4, perfect time, twisterella, drive blind, making judy smile, nowhere, vapour trail, chrome waves, mousetrap, dreams burn down, time of her time, chelsea girl.\n\nI have just heard this is either about to be released, at last, on DVD, or it just has. Sorry I am a bit slow, ripped this ages ago but didn't get it online.\n\nIf you get it on DVD then at least you have this so you can pretend you're watching the video for that retro vibe!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4721fbb0914ff085959180c49d439a80685f21a","amp;dn":"Ride+-+Live+at+Brixton+Academy+%28Going+Blank+Again%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4721fbb0914ff085959180c49d439a80685f21a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,114,31,187,9,20,255,8,89,89,24,12,73,212,57,168,6,133,242,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
