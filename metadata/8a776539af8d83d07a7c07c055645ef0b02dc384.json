I can get them going, but I NEED YOUR HELP to keep the content alive. Even if you have them stopped in your client 99% of the time, any little bit helps.\r\n\r\nA tip: If bandwidth is an issue, instead of removing a torrent as soon as it's finished downloading, do this: in uTorrent, right click the torrent, hit 'properties', and specify the minimum number of seeds goal to 1. This means the torrent will only be active and use bandwidth if you are the only seeder. This way you will hardly ever seed and the content will never die!! Hardly any effort and you get that warm fuzzy feeling of contributing.\r\n\r\nSo to those who have helped in even a small way in keeping my uploads alive over the last few years, THANK YOU!!! This would all be a wasted effort without you all","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a776539af8d83d07a7c07c055645ef0b02dc384","amp;dn":"Amorphis+Discography+%5BFLAC%5D+%5BDeath%2C+Doom%2C+Folk%2C+Prog%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a776539af8d83d07a7c07c055645ef0b02dc384","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,119,101,57,175,141,131,208,122,124,7,192,85,100,94,240,176,45,195,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
