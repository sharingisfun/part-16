The film stars Tim Robbins as Andrew &quot;Andy&quot;\nDufresne and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd &quot;Red&quot; Redding.\n\nThe film portrays Andy spending nearly two decades in\nShawshank State Prison, a fictional penitentiary in Maine, and\nhis friendship with Red, a fellow inmate. This movie exemplifies\nthe potential gap between initial box office success and ultimate\npopularity. Despite a lukewarm box office reception that was\nbarely enough to cover its budget, The Shawshank Redemption\nreceived favorable reviews from critics and has since enjoyed a\nremarkable life on cable television, home video, DVD and Bluray.\nIt continues to be hailed by critics and audiences alike, 15\nyears after its initial release, and is ranked among the greatest\nfilms of all time.\n\nIn 1947, a banker named Andrew &quot;Andy&quot; Dufresne is convicted of\nmurdering his wife and her lover based on strong circumstantial\nevidence and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at\nShawshank State Penitentiary in Maine. At the prison, inmate Ellis\nBoyd &quot;Red&quot; Redding is rejected for parole after having served\ntwenty years of his life sentence shortly before Andy's arrival.\nAndy gradually becomes acquainted with Red's circle of friends,\nand Red himself, who is known for cleverly smuggling in\ncontraband. After a month of adjusting to his new life, Andy\napproaches Red and asks him to get a rock hammer, intending to\npursue a hobby of rock collecting. Red supplies the hammer for\nten dollars, and later fills Andy's request for a poster of Rita\nHayworth.\n\nOne day in 1949, while tarring the roof of Shawshank's license\nplate factory, Andy overhears the captain of the prison guards,\nCaptain Hadley, bitterly complaining about the taxes he will have to\npay on a forthcoming inheritance. Andy approaches Hadley with a\nsolution that will allow him to keep the entire inheritance tax-free;\nthough Hadley nearly throws Andy off the roof initially, Andy's\nwillingness to set up the transaction for the cost of beer for the\ntarring crew wins Hadley's respect. Prior to this, Andy had\nfrequently been beaten and sexually assaulted by a gang called\n&quot;The Sisters&quot;, led by inmates Bogs and Rooster. After a particularly\nvicious beating at the hands of the Sisters lands Andy in the\ninfirmary, Bogs returns to his cell from a week in solitary\nconfinement to find Captain Hadley there. Hadley inflicts a brutal\nnightstick beating on Bogs, which leaves him paralyzed. Bogs is\nsent away to a state hospital, and the message to the Sisters is\nclear; Andy is never bothered again.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/04c82731740304&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/04c82731740304&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/a1ad2931740306&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/a1ad2931740306&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/f59da831740308&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/f59da831740308&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/1e2bb331740311&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/1e2bb331740311&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/27843831741132&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/27843831741132&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFormat                           : MPEG-4\nCodec ID                         : mp42\nFile size                        : 4.58 GiB\nDuration                         : 2h 22mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 4601 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7f371618173f334b514f&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 4 frames\nCodec ID                         : avc1\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 4212 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1920 pixels\nHeight                           : 1080 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16/9\nFrame rate mode                  : Variable\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.085\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat version                   : Version 4\nFormat profile                   : LC\nDuration                         : 2h 22mn\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 384 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 491 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 6 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L C R, Rear: L R, LFE\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42ca5dd208a368975a1eee048a12f77f594ef7e1","amp;dn":"The+Shawshank+Redemption+1080p+BDRip+%5BH.264-MP4%5D+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42ca5dd208a368975a1eee048a12f77f594ef7e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,202,93,210,8,163,104,151,90,30,238,4,138,18,247,127,89,78,247,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
