I probably wouldn't recommend this for veterens of Tolkien.\n/ It often sounds like a glorified Oklahoma high school play production.\n/ Might be terrific for mature youngsters, dramtization fans, first time \n/ or hard core Tolkieners, or the Oklahoma high school drama department.\n/ Lots of other readings and dramatizations out there (BBC etc).\n/ Nice that this one includes Tom Bombadil - the BBC's version did not.\n/ Might help to remember - this is 1979 radio!\n\nNicely tagged and labeled, combined CD tracks, cover scans included.\n\nThanks for sharing &amp; caring.\nCheers, FerraBit\nJanuary 2010\n\n Links:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien \nhighbridgeaudio.com/lordofringswoodbox.html \n\nOriginally posted:          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/FerraBit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/FerraBit&lt;/a&gt; (TPB) &amp; Demonoid\nPlease present your library card, and comment me some loving.\n______________________________________\n\nReview:\n\nThere's this ring, see...\n\n(And then there was this desperate drama department...)\n- - -\n\nThis thing all things devours:\nBirds, beasts, trees, killer super-powers;\nGnaws iron in stiletto heel;\nGrinds overacting actors to meal;\nSlays king, ruins town\nAnd beats Oklahoma high school down.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f559791ff263b7199de3688b25eeae5a27f30294","amp;dn":"THE+LORD+OF+THE+RINGS+-+JRR+Tolkien.+Dramatized+1979+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f559791ff263b7199de3688b25eeae5a27f30294","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,89,121,31,242,99,183,25,157,227,104,139,37,238,174,90,39,243,2,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
