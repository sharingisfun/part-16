It was issued as the third European (and second American) single from their album The Innocents.\n\nKnown as one of their signature tunes, &quot;A Little Respect&quot; continued Erasure's success on the UK singles chart, where it hit number four to become the band's fifth Top 10 single. It was also Erasure's second consecutive Top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, where it climbed to number 14, and hit number two on the U.S. Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart.\n\nWritten by Erasure members Vince Clarke and Andy Bell, the heavily synthesized instrumentation is accentuated by acoustic guitar and Bell's use of falsetto in the chorus. The lyrics are an empowering plea to a lover to show compassion and respect.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3ad4b69bb929606035eee915283ff4e8159735b","amp;dn":"Erasure+-+A+Little+Respect+%5B1988%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3ad4b69bb929606035eee915283ff4e8159735b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,173,75,105,187,146,150,6,3,94,238,145,82,131,255,78,129,89,115,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
