You probably don't miss them.\n\n\nWhat's This?\n     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be 750-800gb in total. It will take a year or two. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n\n\nToday's offering: DC from Crisis Aftermath (Infinite Crisis), to DC Graphic Novels.\n\n\tA little rant - Graphic Novels are comics. They are expensive pretentious comic books, because some people think they are &quot;too good&quot; to be comic books. It's all marketing to reach people who wouldn't buy them if they were called &quot;Comic Book Novels&quot;. They could be called &quot;Comic Novels&quot; but that might make people think they are meant to be funny which most are not. Of course there are unintentionally amusing things about some of them. For example &quot;Arkham Asylum&quot; has a script that has significant dependance on art that actually showed you a detailed scene but instead it got an artist who seemed to desire most of all that you could not tell what the heck you were supposed to be looking at half the time. Simple representational art, i.e illustrating the dang story, was apparently too much to ask. This is one of the reasons it is frequently considered to be a bad book. Trying to get above it self, instead it sinks below what it could have been. Hubris.\n\n     As usual I have everything of DC that has been scanned, and some Pre and or Post DC comics for characters or series DC has published which have also been published by others.\n  \n     \nEnjoy!\n\nCrisis Aftermath-The Battle For Bludhaven 01-06 (2006)\nCrisis Aftermath-The Spectre 01-03 (2006)\n\nCrisis on Infinite Earths 01-12 (1985-86)\nCrisis on Infinite Earths Extras\nCrisis on Infinite Earths HC+TPB\nCrisis on Infinite Earths-text novel\nCrisis on Infinite Earths Extras\n     Crisis On Infinite Earths (2009)-GraphicAudio\n     Crisis on Infinite Earths Poster by George Perez &amp; Alex Ross\n     Millennium Edition 007-Crisis On Infinite Earths\n     The Annotated Crisis on IE-html files.zip\n\nThere's not much more to this next as a specific spoof other than the title from what I can gather from just paging through it, but my level of resistance is low with regard to including extra stuff. \n\nCrisis on Multiple Earths Reprints (TPB reprints of carious Earth I - Earth II (or other) crossover stories. Crisis is not used in the same sense as in as the several &quot;Major Crisis&quot; arcs DC has done. All the stories are or will be in one part or another of this DC torrent series. It would be nice if they were scanned or if someone would make a remix of them, as having them collected like this makes for easy reading.\n\nCrossing Midnight 01-19 (Vertigo(2007-08 )\nCrossover Classics Covers (DC-Marvel-Top Cow\nCrucible 01-06 (1993)\nCruel and Unusual 01-04 (Vertigo(1999)\nCruise of Lost Souls, The-Bilal (Humanoids\nCrusaders, The 01-08 (!mpact(1992)\nThe Crusades 01-20 (2001-2002)\nThe Crusades-Urban Decree (2001)\nCuba-My Revolution ctc (2011)\nCyberella 01-12 (Helix(1996-1997)\nCybernary 01-05 (Wildstorm-Image(1995-1996)\nCybernary 2.0 01-06 (Wildstorm(2001-2002)\nDaily Planet Special Edition-Superman Returns (2006)\nDaily Planet Special Invasion Edition\nDale Evans 01-24 (1948-1952)\nDamage 000, 01-20 (1994-1996)\nDamned 01-04 (Image-Homage(1997)\n\nDanger!

I won't fly until freedom is balanced with an illusion of security which is all it is anyway. I know my little protest changes nothing, but I've always felt that that's a lame excuse for not doing the right thing. A good test for the right action in many circumstances is to ask what would happen if everybody did it. \n\nDanger Girl\nDanger Girl 01-07 (Image-Cliffhanger-DC(1998 )\nDanger Girl 3-D Special (2003)\nDanger Girl Pics\nDanger Girl Sketchbook-J.Scott Campbell (2001)\nDanger Girl Special 01-02\nDanger Girl TPB covers\nDanger Girl-Back in Black 01-04 (2006)\nDanger Girl-Body Shots 01-04 (2007)\nDanger Girl-Hawaiian Punch-2 covers (05-2003)\nDanger Girl-Kamikaze 01-02 (2001)\nDanger Girl-The Ultimate Collection\nDanger Girl-Viva las Danger-2 covers\n\nYet More Danger!

I include the redundant and differently named HC &amp;  doubly redundant TPB and even the triply redundant HC separate extras. Because I can, it's scanned, I'm insane (possibly in a court of law, so watch out). It's also handy  for those who pick and choose what to download-  which you shouldn't do. Get a bunch of DVDs or a couple big hard drives (one for backup) and get it all! I know some of you can't afford that. If you were REALLY a DC fan you would get the money somehow. A well planned burglary or stickup is always an option or a part time second job  Don't tell me there's no way for you to get the money. Just how deep is your commitment? I hear dealing drugs or good old prostitution can be a good source of quick cash. Suggestion void where severe punishment such as the death penalty exists for any of these &quot;crimes&quot;. Remember you are not actually a comic book character. Death is generally permanent for real people. (Some do report there have been a few exceptions, but it's not going to happen to you.)\n\nDark Knight Strikes Again, The (2002)\n     Batman-The Dark Knight Strikes Again HC (2002)\n     Batman-The Dark Knight Strikes Again HC Extras\n     Batman-The Dark Knight Strikes Again TPB 221p\n     Batman-The Dark Knight Strikes Again TPB Sketchbook\n     Dark Knight Strikes Again, The 01-03 (2002)\n     Frank Miller Mini Poster\n\nDark Night Again. Have you ever considered why it is that a man who began as &quot;a dark creature of the night  -  a,  a,   a  -  bat!&quot; soon began to run around with a kid in a brightly colored &quot;Circus Costume&quot;? It's changed somewhat since then, but rumor has it even Nightwing will soon have a costume with some of the robin red in it. DC has shown what is either the actual new costume or at least a possible one. A real batman would never have done this.  It doesn't fit. It's simply ridiculous within the concept world of batman back in the 1940' or the modern age. I'll grant you that some of the time in between the whole  &quot;dark knight&quot; thing was pretty much on the back burner. But still, a yellow cape, red vest and green pants are just plain silly,  Is the idea of Batman with a yellow circle on his chest. Dark Knights do not which to break camouflage for decorative purposes. Even the bat is a question, but at least's it's black. But of course you may not agree. Don't feel bad about it. I've been wrong sometimes too.\n\nDark Knight, The 001 ctc 2 covers (01-2011)\nDark Knight, The-Featuring Production Art &amp; Full Shooting Script (2008 )\nDark Mansion of Forbidden Love 01-04 (1971-1972)\nDark Nemesis (Villians)-New Year's Evil (02-1998 )\n\nDarkchylde is just barely a DC character, but she is one of those that came in when Wildstorm (which had Homage as an imprint) moved from Image Comics to DC.
