Looking for something to keep them busy, Dean and Sam head to Washington to find the ghost. While the two interview the girlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother, Betty, they are surprised when she starts talking about cold spots and fritzing. When they ask her about bringing up paranormal signs, Betty replies that the Ã¢â‚¬Å“supernaturalistsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ who called earlier brought it up. Enter Harry and Ed, the famous supernaturalists. \n\nBlade Runners - \nDean is frustrated when he can't reach Crowley who has promised to find The First Blade. When Crowley finally calls Sam and Dean, he tells them he fell off the wagon and has been injecting human blood and needs their help. To make matters worse, he had a demon helping him find blood, but she sold him out and told Abaddon that he and the Winchesters were searching for The First Blade. The brothers need to find the blade before Abaddon does, so they enlist the help of a former member of the Men of Letters.\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------o------------------------------------\nMedia Info:\nSource: 720p HDTV - DIMENSION (870MB)\n* Overall bit rate : 898 Kbps CBR\n&gt;&gt; VIDEO:\n* Format : MKV/AVC\n* File size : 272 MB\n* Duration : 42mn 17s\n* Video bit rate : 850 Kbps CBR\n* Width : 1280 pixels\n* Height : 720 pixels\n* Bit Depth : 8 bits\n* Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n* Language : English\n* Subtitle: English (Synced &amp; Corrected by elderman)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; AUDIO:\n* Format : HE-AACv2\n* Bit rate : 48 Kbps CBR\n* Sampling Rate: 48 kHz\n===============================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f6886715d40908e96c1e51e419e3337e2f1e264","amp;dn":"Supernatural+S09E15+%26amp%3B+16+%5Bx264+Super+720p%5D+Eng+Subs+-+Joker_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f6886715d40908e96c1e51e419e3337e2f1e264","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,104,134,113,93,64,144,142,150,193,229,30,65,158,51,55,226,241,226,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
