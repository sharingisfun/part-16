Originally introduced in 2002, ASP.NET has undergone many changes in multiple versions and iterations as developers have gained a decade of experience with this popular technology. With that decade of experience, this edition of the book presents a fresh, new overhauled approach.\n- A new focus on how to build ASP.NET sites and applications relying on field-tested reliable methods\n- Integration of &quot;One ASP.NET&quot; philosophy treating ASP.NET Web Forms and ASP.NET MVC as equal tools each with their proper time and place\n- Coverage of hot new ASP.NET 4.5 additions such as the Web API, Websockets and HTML5 &amp; CSS3 use in layout but only to the extent that the tools themselves are practical and useful for working ASP.NET developers.\n\nTitle: Professional ASP.NET 4.5 in C # and VB\nAuthor: Jason N.
