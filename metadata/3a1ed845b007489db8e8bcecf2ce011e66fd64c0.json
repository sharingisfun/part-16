Expanded, remixed, and remastered by Bill Laswell from the original Polydor master tapes.\n\nIn 1999, Bill Laswell decided to re-imagine this seminal jazz fusion album. However, Verve Records refused to release the album once it was completed, claiming it would never sell. However, it was released on CD-R directly to a small music shop in New York City frequented by Bill Laswell himself, the Downtown Music Gallery.\ntiburon\n\n\nUnabridged version of the complete album includes 4 UNRELEASED CUTS, AND 5 LONGER UNEDITED VERSIONS from album sessions - which was intended as a double LP but only released as an editied single LP; cover art by Russell Mills, liner notes by John Szwed. Thanks to Bill Laswell for rescuing, and finally giving a proper mastering to match William's original intentions, to this most seminal, groundbreaking recording, mixing jazz, rock, prog and metal years ahead of virtually everyone else!\nDMG\n\nReview of the shorter LP version: &quot;The better of the two albums the Tony Williams Lifetime recorded in 1970, Turn It Over, is a far more focused and powerful album than the loose, experimental Ego, and one of the more intense pieces of early jazz-rock fusion around. In parts, it's like Jimi Hendrix's Band of Gypsys with much better chops. It's more rock-oriented and darker-hued than their debut, 1969's Emergency!, and the temporary addition of ex-Cream member Jack Bruce on bass and vocals alongside stalwart guitarist John McLaughlin [with whom Bruce recorded the instrumental album 'Things We Like' just before this] makes this something of a milestone of British progressive jazz. The album's primary flaw is that unlike the expansive double album Emergency!, these ten songs are tightly constricted into pop-song forms -- only a swinging cover of Antonio Carlos Jobim's &quot;Once I Loved&quot; breaks the five-minute mark, and then only barely -- which reins in these marvelous soloists too much. This is particularly frustrating since pieces like the two-part &quot;To Whom It May Concern&quot; feature some outstanding solos (especially from McLaughlin and organist Larry Young, the group's secret weapon) that are frustratingly, tantalizingly short. Expanded to a double album [as originally intended, and as this CD edition finally reveals], Turn It Over would probably surpass Emergency! as a pioneering jazz-rock fusion release; as it is, it's an exciting but mildly maddening session.\nStewart Mason AMG\n\n\n1 Vuelta Abajo*\n2 To Whom It May Concern: Us/Them\n3 This Night This Song*\n4 Do That**\n5 Big Nick*\n6 Once I Loved\n7 To Whom**\n8 Allah Be Praised*\n9 Right On*\n10 A Famous Blues\n11 New Piece**\n\n*Unedited version\n**Previously unreleased\n\nTony Williams Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ drums, vocals\nJohn McLaughlin Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ guitar, vocals\nLarry Young (Khalid Yassin) Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ organ\nJack Bruce Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ bass, vocals\n\nOriginal tracks recorded at Olmstead Sound Studios, \nNew York, NY in 1970 Original Recordings \nproduced by Monte Kay, Jack Lewis and Tony Williams \n1999 expanded edition - Bill Laswell: Production and mix translation \nEngineers at Turtle Tone Studios: Michael Fossenkemper and Alex Theoret","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a1ed845b007489db8e8bcecf2ce011e66fd64c0","amp;dn":"Tony+Williams+Turn+It+Over+-+The+Bill+Laswell+Remix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a1ed845b007489db8e8bcecf2ce011e66fd64c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,30,216,69,176,7,72,157,184,232,188,236,242,206,1,30,102,253,100,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
