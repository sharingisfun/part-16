Combining puzzle solving and a dramatic storyline, these shows fascinate audiences as high-tech procedures uncover the truths hidden in seemingly insignificant clues. What many people may not realize is that forensic teams also use items they probably have in their own homes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ digital cameras, computers, and Photoshop image editing software. &quot;Adobe Photoshop Forensics: Sleuths, Truths, and Fauxtography&quot; shows you how Photoshop is used to create many types of fakery and fraud, including scientific, counterfeiting, art, journalism, and political propaganda. You'll discover that with some basic training in Photoshop's manipulation capabilities and a critical eye, you too can see through photographic hoaxes. Follow along as each chapter explores a different genre of real-life frauds, both historical and current, and explains how the fakery was or could be detected. A featured case file in each chapter carefully deconstructs a faked image so you can see the methods and processes followed by the image editing professionals who solve - and the perpetrators who commit - a variety of crimes. Even if you've never considered altering an image or becoming a crime scene investigator, you'll get a kick out of discovering the how and why behind both famous and common acts of image fraud with &quot;Adobe Photoshop Forensics!&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b311f1036c28c1ece95593f9855ee929905f4947","amp;dn":"Adobe+Photoshop+Forensics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b311f1036c28c1ece95593f9855ee929905f4947","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,17,241,3,108,40,193,236,233,85,147,249,133,94,233,41,144,95,73,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
