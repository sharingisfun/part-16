He reveals how the British and French duped Wilson into thinking the war was as good as won, and there would be no need to send an army overseas. He describes a harried president making speech after speech proclaiming America's ideals while supporting espionage and sedition acts that sent critics to federal prisons. And he gives a harrowing account of how the Allies did their utmost to turn the American Expeditionary Force into cannon fodder on the Western Front.Thoroughly researched and dramatically told, The Illusion of Victory offers compelling testimony to the power of a president's visionary ideals-as well as a starkly cautionary tale about the dangers of applying them in a war-maddened world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03ed22b757aba1369f7f6d6ac36878c8a1aaccb4","amp;dn":"The+Illusion+of+Victory-+America+in+World+War+I+by+Thomas+Flemin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03ed22b757aba1369f7f6d6ac36878c8a1aaccb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,237,34,183,87,171,161,54,159,127,109,106,195,104,120,200,161,170,204,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
