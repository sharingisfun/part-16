I have some of his works here from the two CDs that I could find. I'll try to find more and post them up as time permits.\n\nChamber music (performed by the Australian Chamber Orchestra):\nPort Essington (1977)\nLament for Strings (1976, revised 1991)\nIrkanda IV (1961)\nSonata for Strings (1984)\n\nOrchestral music (performed by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra under Stuart Challender):\nEarth Cry (1986)\nIrkanda IV (1961)\nSmall Town (1976)\nKakadu (1988)\nMangrove (1979)\n\nUnfortunately there wasn't much information included about soloists.\n\nFormat is 256k VBR AAC. \n\nPLEASE REMEMBER that there are two versions of Irkanda IV on here; the Sydney sym. one is better I think.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0afefab7dda489f9514c0b34f3d0c10fd08ebd7e","amp;dn":"Sculthorpe%2C+Peter+%281929%29+-+Chamber+and+Orchestral+selections+%28AA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0afefab7dda489f9514c0b34f3d0c10fd08ebd7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,254,250,183,221,164,137,249,81,76,11,52,243,208,193,15,208,142,189,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
