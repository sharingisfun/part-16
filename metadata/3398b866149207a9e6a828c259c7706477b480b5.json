This health literacy textbook provides an overview of health literacy, discusses the magnitude of the issue, and explains implications of low health literacy. It details strategies to enhance effective communication between patients and nursing practitioners. Through case-based examples, this textbook and clinical guide assists nurses in developing the requisite skills needed to communicate effectively so that patients can truly make informed health decisions and enhance health outcomes.\n\n\n\nHealth Literacy in Nursing promotes verbal and written communication strategies that nurses can use to effectively meet the individualized needs of an increasingly diverse patient population in an effort to enhance patient-provider communication across the entire continuum of care. It provides strategies for creating culturally appropriate written materials in plain language that patients can read and follow when they arrive home.\n\n\n\nNursing professionals can build upon the basic tools offered in the text throughout their career to stay abreast of methods to effectively communicate and educate a culturally and linguistically diverse demographic. Additionally, the material can easily be incorporated into course content regarding &quot;unique populations&quot; (pediatrics, older adults, research participants, and those managing mental health and end-of-life care decisions) for whom health literacy is often overlooked. The book will be valuable to undergraduate and graduate nursing students studying to meet advanced nurse practice competencies and is an essential resource for practicing nurses who must stay abreast of evolving standards and regulations related to the provision of safe and effective patient and family-centered care.\n\n\n\nKey Features: \n\nProvides a solid foundation for developing skills that foster health literacy among all patients and practitioners \nAssists in meeting the regulatory requirements for providing culturally and linguistically appropriate patient education \nIncludes guidelines for improving health literacy according to increasingly evolving regulatory standards \nIncludes case-based examples to illustrate the purpose and effectiveness of enhancing patient and provider health literacy skills \nAddresses both oral and written communication strategies ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3398b866149207a9e6a828c259c7706477b480b5","amp;dn":"Health+Literacy+in+Nursing-+Parnell+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3398b866149207a9e6a828c259c7706477b480b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,152,184,102,20,146,7,169,230,168,40,194,89,199,112,100,119,180,128,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
