Born in Ballyshannon, Co. Donegal, on 2 March, 1948, he grew up in the city of Cork. Based in London during most of his 30 year career, he toured extensively, sold 30 million records, and had a worldwide following of loyal fans. He died in London at the early age of 47, on 14 June 1995, from complications following a liver transplant. Although he had suffered health problems for some time, he toured until falling seriously ill late in 1994. Gallagher was a master of the guitar and he was influenced heavily not only by rock and roll, but by blues and jazz also. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:856ea4c0cb502fcb613235e93052b842469ba421","amp;dn":"Rory+Gallagher+Irish+Tour+1974+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"856ea4c0cb502fcb613235e93052b842469ba421","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,110,164,192,203,80,47,203,97,50,53,233,48,82,184,66,70,155,164,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
