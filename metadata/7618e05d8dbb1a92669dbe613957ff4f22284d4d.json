Gerald said of Lawrence:\n\n'The difference between us is that he loves writing\nand I don't. To me it's simply a way to make money\nwhich enables me to do my animal work, nothing more.'\n\nYou wouldn't know it from the quality of his prose.\n\nCast\nAdam Usden\nWill Tracey\nCelia Imrie\nToby Jones\nAnna Kerr\nPaul Hunter\nAndreas Marcos\nKatija David\nGraeme Hawly\n.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7618e05d8dbb1a92669dbe613957ff4f22284d4d","amp;dn":"BBC+R4+-+Gerald+Durrell%5C%27s+%5C%27My+Family+And+Other+Animals%5C%27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7618e05d8dbb1a92669dbe613957ff4f22284d4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,24,224,93,141,187,26,146,102,157,190,97,57,87,255,79,34,40,77,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
