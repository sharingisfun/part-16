The work they did combines the taut emotional and psychological insights of Stephen Crane with a verisimilitude so gritty that it seems as if they are reporting from the scene. Together with inker and friend Will Elder, whose own obsession for detail perfectly heightened the impact of every line, they produced 34 war stories Ã¢â‚¬â€ emotionally draining and dramatically eloquent Ã¢â‚¬â€ in just under three years. This book collects them all. Settings include: the Roman empire; the Revolutionary War; the American-Indian Wars; the Alamo; the Civil War; World War I (in the trenches and in the air); World War II (in the Pacific and in Europe, including the D-Day invasion); and the Korean War.\n\n&quot;The minute you looked at his artwork you knew you were looking at a John Severin illustration; it could be no one else. Besides his inimitable style, there was a feeling of total authenticity to whatever he drew, whether it was a Western, a crime story, a superhero saga or a science fiction yarn.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Stan Lee\n\n&quot;...I am not only appreciative...but also very impressed. [The books] are spectacular packages of their featured artist and their stories.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Al Feldstein","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:886d1f35acc2026963a0245544fd2a4095f2dd65","amp;dn":"Kurtzman%2C+Severin%2C+Elder+-+Bomb+Run+and+Other+Stories","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"886d1f35acc2026963a0245544fd2a4095f2dd65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,109,31,53,172,194,2,105,99,160,36,85,68,253,42,64,149,242,221,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
