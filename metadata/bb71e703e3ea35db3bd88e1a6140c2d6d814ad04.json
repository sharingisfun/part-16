It was a critical and commercial failure by the standards of the day, but it still holds up as a sharp and compelling comic book series. Robert Loren Fleming gave life to a great cast of odd and inviting characters without giving in to clichÃƒÂ© and Trevor Von Eeden is the one who shaped the idea with a wildly imaginative vision. Perhaps what made Thriller unique is what killed it. How Thriller was ever released in the first place by DC Comics seems like a fluke, but the proof is in the short lived run: there was no comic out there like it and there never will be.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://michelfiffe.com/?p=756&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://michelfiffe.com/?p=756&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb71e703e3ea35db3bd88e1a6140c2d6d814ad04","amp;dn":"Thriller+%23+1-12+%28DC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb71e703e3ea35db3bd88e1a6140c2d6d814ad04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,113,231,3,227,234,53,219,59,216,142,26,97,64,194,214,216,20,173,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
