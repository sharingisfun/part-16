Hole Hearted\n\n\nFamous for the acoustic ballad More Than Words, Extreme's sophomore album has much more to offer: the songs are well written and fun to listen, the recording quality is great, with the guitars not all muddy and washed out, but clear, and you can still hear the vocals and everything else over them. Also the musicianship on this record is great in the vocals by Gary Cherone and the guitars by Nuno Bettencourt. Extreme's best album without a doubt. \n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 24\nArtist: Extreme\nAlbum: Extreme II - Pornograffiti\nYear: 1990\nGenre: Rock\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b998e353a87a24012c5baacaa951748b32df6127","amp;dn":"Extreme+-+Pornograffitti+%5BFLAC-1990%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b998e353a87a24012c5baacaa951748b32df6127","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,152,227,83,168,122,36,1,44,91,170,202,169,81,116,139,50,223,97,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
