Her versions of Robert Wilkins' &quot;No Way For Me To Get Along&quot; and Rev. Gary Davis' &quot;Sit Down On The Banks&quot; were among the high points, as well as Block's &quot;Dr. Make It Right&quot; and &quot;I Might Find A Way.&quot; For the most part, the songs were nicely performed and varied between upbeat and somber themes. Block's vocals were frequently outstanding and never less than convincing, while her playing was strong and steady.
