Told from the Japanese perspective, The Rising Sun is, in the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s words, Ã¢â‚¬Å“a factual saga of people caught up in the flood of the most overwhelming war of mankind, told as it happenedÃ¢â‚¬â€muddled, ennobling, disgraceful, frustrating, full of paradox.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIn weaving together the historical facts and human drama leading up to and culminating in the war in the Pacific, Toland crafts a riveting and unbiased narrative history. In his Foreword, Toland says that if we are to draw any conclusion from The Rising Sun, it is Ã¢â‚¬Å“that there are no simple lessons in history, that it is human nature that repeats itself, not history.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe Rising Sun The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936-1945 [EPUB]\n\nAuthor: John Toland\nPublisher: May 27th 2003 by Modern Library (first published 1970)\nLanguage: English\nFormat: EPUB\nQuality: originally eBook\nPages: ~976\n\nForeword\n\nAfter World War II most Westerners felt that General Tojo and other Japanese leadersÃ¢â‚¬â€indeed the mass of JapaneseÃ¢â‚¬â€were no better than Hitler and his Nazi cohorts, and deserved whatever punishment and misfortune that befell them.\nTwenty-five years have passed and Japan has recovered from almost total moral and economic disaster to resume a respected place among nations of the world. Still, the question remains: How could we have come to admire and respect a people who often acted like barbarians during the war?\n\nThis book, which is largely seen from the Japanese point of view, is an attempt to answer that question as well as others about the war that changed the face of Asia. Why did a country the size of California launch the suicidal attack on Pearl Harbor which involved it in a death struggle with an enemy ten times stronger? Was war between the two nations, which today find so much in common, inevitable and essential? Did the winning of that war perpetuate American involvement in Asian affairs?\n\nI would not have attempted to write this bookÃ¢â‚¬â€even with the assistance of a Japanese wife and her familyÃ¢â‚¬â€but for two things: a drastic change in Japanese attitudes toward their own immediate past and the appearance of significant new documents. In addition to the mountain of material already available in the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Military History Archives of the Japan Defense Agency, valuable documents that had been hidden or lost were recently discovered, such as records of the imperial and liaison conferences, the supposedly burned portions of the Konoye Diary, and the thousand-page &quot;Notes&quot; of Field Marshal Gen Sugiyama, Chief of the Army General Staff from 1940 to February 21, 1944.\n\nEven more important has been the willingness of Japan's former military and civilian leadersÃ¢â‚¬â€including Marquis Koichi Kido, the Emperor's chief adviser; Prince Mikasa, the Emperor's youngest brother; Admiral Ryunosuke Kusaka, de facto commander at Pearl Harbor and Midway; and General Kenryo Sato, perhaps Tojo's most trusted confidantÃ¢â‚¬â€to talk freely and at length about the unhappy past. Gone is the reluctance, apparent only a few years ago during research for But Not in Shame, to discuss certain sensitive subjects. Moreover, they are convinced that Westerners, after their postwar experiences in Asia, will have more understanding of the blunders they made in Manchuria and China. Those who fought the war, from generals to privates, have also been more willing to talk of their mistakes, and speak of the unspeakable: cowardice, murder, cannibalism, surrenderÃ¢â‚¬â€and desertion.\n\nIn the interest of accuracy these men, as well as everyone else interviewed whose story is included in the book, read the passages about themselves and often added illuminating comments. The dialogue in the book is not fictional. It comes from transcripts, records and stenographic notes, and the memory of the participants. The extensive debates during the various imperial and liaison conferences, for example, are based on the Sugiyama &quot;Notes&quot;; the recently assembled official records; diaries; and interviews with Marquis Kido, who was given an immediate report of each conference the Emperor attended, and participants including General Teiichi Suzuki, Naoki Hoshino and Okinori Kaya. The Notes (at the end of the book) list sources for all material used, chapter by chapter.\n\nAmerica's greatest mistake in World War II, I believe, was in failing to recognize that she was fighting two different kinds of war simultaneously: one in Europe against another Western people and philosophy, Nazism, and one in Asia which was not only a struggle against an aggressive nation fighting for survival as a modern power but an ideological contest against an entire continent. Millions of Orientals saw Japan's battle as their own, as a confrontation of race and color; they also saw in Japan's victories their own liberation from Western domination.\n&quot;Each nation, the United States not excepted, has made its contribution to the welter of evil which now comprises the Far East question.&quot; Tyier Dennett, an authority on the Far East, wrote in 1922: &quot;We shall all do well to drop for all time the pose of self-righteousness and injured innocence and penitently face the facts.&quot;\n\nIf we had done so, it is very probable that our negotiations with Japan in 1941 would have ended in peace, not war, and America would not have been forced to become the moral policeman of Asia for many years. And a moral policeman's lot is not a happy one, particularly when his own morality is in question.\n\nWhat follows is a factual saga of people caught up in the flood of the most overwhelming war of mankind, told as it happenedÃ¢â‚¬â€muddled, ennobling, disgraceful, frustrating, full of contradiction and paradox. I have done my utmost to let the events speak for themselves, and if any conclusion was reached, it was that there are no simple lessons in history, that it is human nature that repeats itself, not history. We often learn more about the past from the present, in fact, than the reverse. The lessons of our own brutalities in postwar Asia, for example, have undoubtedly given Americans insight into the actions of the Japanese a generation ago.\n\n\nFind out user's reviews and reader's rates on GoodReads\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79929.The_Rising_Sun&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79929.The_Rising_Sun&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a846326fcd9c03fe48a23ba3b833931b08f15a4","amp;dn":"The+Rising+Sun+UNABRIDGED+%5Baudiobook%5D+%2B+%5Bepub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a846326fcd9c03fe48a23ba3b833931b08f15a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,132,99,38,252,217,192,63,228,138,35,186,59,131,57,49,176,143,21,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
