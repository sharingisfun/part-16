I based my tracklist on four setlists from 1977 and 1978 shows, trying to get the songs grouped together in the same order as on the lists. A lot of artistic freedom was taken in this, but I think I got it to sound like a real show would.\n\nThe tracklist is as follows:\n\n01 Hopelessly Human\n02 Song For America\n03 Point Of Know Return\n04 Paradox\n05 Icarus (Born On Wings Of Steel)\n06 Down The Road\n07 Belexes\n08 Closet Chronicles\n09 Mysteries &amp; Mayhem\n10 Excerpt From Lamplight Symphony\n11 The Wall\n12 Lonely Street\n13 Dust In The Wind-Acoustic Guitar solo\n14 Lonely Wind-Piano solo\n15 Cheyenne Anthem\n16 Miracles Out Of Nowhere\n17 Child Of Innocence\n18 The Spider\n19 Portrait (He Knows)\n20 Carry On Wayward Son\n21 Journey From Mariabronn\n22 Sparks Of The Tempest\n23 Magnum Opus\n24 Bringing It Back\n\n\nBelow are the setlists I used as reference. You can see how different they all are, and maybe how I figured out how to do this the way I did.\n\n1977-04-03 New York, NY\n\nIntroduction\nCarry On Wayward Son\nIcarus - Borne On Wings Of Steel\nDown The Road\nMysteries And Mayhem\nExcerpt From Lamplight Symphony\nLamplight\nThe Wall\nLonely Wind\nMiracles Out Of Nowhere\nGuitar Solo\nChild Of Innocence\nMagnum Opus\nBelexes\nSong For America\nViolin Solo\nCheyenne Anthem\nViolin Solo\nMagnum Opus\n\n\n1977-12-13 Providence Civic Center\n\nHopelessly Human\nPoint Of Know Return\nParadox\nIcarus (Borne On Wings Of Steel)\nChild Of Innocence\nCloset Chronicles\nDust In The Wind\nAcoustic Guitar Solo\nPiano Solo\nLonely Wind\nCheyenne Anthem\nMiracles Out Of Nowhere\nDrum Solo\nThe Spider\nPortrait (He Knew)\n16 Sparks Of The Tempest\n17 E1: Carry On Wayward Son\n18 Down The Road\n\n\n1978-03-28 Paris, France\n\nCarry On My Wayward Son\nDown The Road\nPoint Of Know Return\nBelexes\nCloset Chronicles\nMysteries and Mayhem\nMan Overboard ....\nThe Wall\nDust In The Wind\nCheyenne Anthem\nIntro's\nMiracles Out Of Nowhere\nPortrait (he knew)\nSparks Of The Tempest\nJourney From Mariabronn\nMedley\n\n1978-08-06 Mosport Park, Ontario\n\nSong For America\nPoint of Know Return\nParadox\nDown The Road\nMysteries and Mayhem/Lamplight Symphony Segment\nThe Wall\nLonely Street\nDust In The Wind\nMiracles Out Of Nowhere\nPortrait (He Knew)\nCarry On Wayward Son\nMagnum Opus\nBringing It Back\n\n\n\nThe following is the running order on the original double-vinyl release, which had some, but not much, influence on the sequencing of the above work.\n\nSong for America\nPoint of Know Return\nParadox\nIcarus - Borne on Wings of Steel\nPortrait (He Knew)\nCarry On Wayward Son\nJourney From Mariabronn\nDust in the Wind (Featuring Rich Williams Acoustic Guitar Solo)\nLonely Wind (Featuring Kerry Livgren Piano Solo)\nMysteries and Mayhem\nExcerpt from Lamplight Symphony\nThe Wall\nCloset Chronicles\nMagnum Opus\n\nMore to come.
