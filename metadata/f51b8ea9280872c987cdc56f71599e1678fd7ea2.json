Taking into account the country\u0019s unrivaled, voluminous tradition of history writing, John Keay has composed a vital and illuminating overview of the nation\u0019s complex and vivid past. Keay\u0019s authoritative history examines 5,000 years in China, from the time of the Three Dynasties through Chairman Mao and the current economic transformation of the country. Crisp, judicious, and engaging, China is the classic single-volume history for anyone seeking to understand the present and future of this immensely powerful nation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f51b8ea9280872c987cdc56f71599e1678fd7ea2","amp;dn":"Keay%2C+John+-+China_+A+History.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f51b8ea9280872c987cdc56f71599e1678fd7ea2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,27,142,169,40,8,114,201,135,205,197,111,113,89,158,22,120,253,126,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
