An example of Action Analysis would be Shrek's swagger in the film, Shrek. The animators clearly understood (through action analysis) the type of walk achieved by a large and heavy individual (the real) and then applied their observations to the animated character of an ogre (the fantastic). It is action analysis that enabled the animation team to visually translate a real life situation into an ogre's walk, achieving such fantastic results.\r\n\r\nKey animation skills are demonstrated with in-depth illustrations, photographs and live action footage filmed with high speed cameras. Detailed Case Studies and practical assignments ground action analysis methodology with real life examples. Action Analysis for Animators is a essential guide for students, amateurs and professionals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b563de4a972d66c0f08a6a05f1476f59f425082","amp;dn":"Action+Analysis+for+Animators+-+1st+Edition+%282012%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b563de4a972d66c0f08a6a05f1476f59f425082","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,86,61,228,169,114,214,108,15,8,166,160,95,20,118,245,159,66,80,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
