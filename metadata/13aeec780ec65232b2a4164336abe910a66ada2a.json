Loftus, author of the critically acclaimed Why I Became an Atheist, has assembled fifteen outstanding articles by leading skeptics, expanding on themes introduced in Loftus's first book. \n\nCentral is a defense of Loftus's &quot;outsider's test of faith,&quot; arguing that believers should test their faith with the same skeptical standards they use to evaluate the other faiths they reject, as if they were outsiders. Experts in medicine, psychology, and anthropology join Loftus to show in four chapters why, when this test is applied to Christianity, it becomes very difficult to rationally defend. \n\nThree chapters follow that demonstrate errors and superstitions throughout the Bible, making any claim of the Bible being God's word nearly impossible to sustain. Then two chapters expose the immorality of the biblical God, with an innovative argument from animal suffering, and a cogent reply to Christians who attempt to defend the depravity of the Bible's God. Three chapters then focus on why it is unreasonable to believe that Jesus is the risen son of God. \n\nFinally, three popular Christian claims are dispatched. The contributors show why Christianity does not provide the basis for morality, atheism was not the reason Hitler murdered so many, and Christianity was not responsible for modern science. Collectively, these articles reveal that popular Christian beliefs tend to rely on ignorance of the facts. \n\nDrawing together experts in diverse fields, including Hector Avalos, Richard Carrier, David Eller, and Robert Price, The Christian Delusion deals a powerful blow against Christian faith.\n\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\nOther related torrents by Jalucian:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8328182/AACON_2013_Matt_Dillahunty_-_Skepticism_And_Atheism_%5B720p%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8328182/AACON_2013_Matt_Dillahunty_-_Skepticism_And_Atheism_%5B720p%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\nor\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13aeec780ec65232b2a4164336abe910a66ada2a","amp;dn":"The+Christian+Delusion+Why+Faith+Fails+-+Jalucian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13aeec780ec65232b2a4164336abe910a66ada2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,174,236,120,14,198,82,50,178,164,22,67,54,171,233,16,166,106,218,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
