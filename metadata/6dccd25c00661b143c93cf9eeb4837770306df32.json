The screenplay was adapted by Douglas Kenney, Chris Miller and Harold Ramis from stories written by Miller and published in National Lampoon magazine based on Miller's experiences in the Alpha Delta fraternity at Dartmouth College, as well as Ramis' experiences in the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity at Washington University in St. Louis, and producer Ivan Reitman's experiences at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. The film is about a misfit group of fraternity men who challenge their college's administrators.\n\nEarly casting ideas included Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, Brian Doyle-Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and John Belushi. Of these five comedians, only Belushi was cast and he received $35,000 for the film with a bonus after it became a hit. Several of the actors, including Tom Hulce, Karen Allen and Kevin Bacon, were just beginning their careers. The studio's executives disagreed with Landis' selections and wanted to cast dramatic actors as well as comedians.\n\nUpon its initial release, Animal House received generally mixed but often positive reviews from critics, with Time and the famed Roger Ebert proclaiming it one of the year's best. It is considered to be the movie that launched the gross-out genre, although it was predated by several films now also included in the genre. Initially budgeted at a modest $2.7 million (raised to $3 million after production got underway), the film has turned out to be one of the most profitable movies of all time. Since its initial release, Animal House has garnered an estimated return of more than $141 million in the form of video and DVDs, not including merchandising. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film &quot;culturally significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. This film is number 1 on Bravo's 100 Funniest Movies. It was number 36 on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs list of the 100 best American comedies.\n\nIn 2008, Empire Magazine selected Animal House as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimal House 1978\n\n\nThe soundtrack is a mix of rock and roll and rhythm and blues with the original score created by film composer Elmer Bernstein, who had been a Landis family friend since John Landis was a child.[11] Bernstein was easily persuaded to score the film, but was not sure what to make of it. Landis asked him to score it as though it were serious. Bernstein said that his work on this film opened yet another door in his diverse career, to scoring comedies\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Faber College Theme&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Louie, Louie&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Twistin' the Night Away&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Tossin' and Turnin'&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Shama Lama Ding Dong&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Hey Paula&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Animal House&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Intro&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Money (That's What I Want)&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Let's Dance&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Dream Girl&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;(What a) Wonderful World&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;Shout&quot;  \n14.\t&quot;Faber College Theme&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dccd25c00661b143c93cf9eeb4837770306df32","amp;dn":"Animal+House+1978+%28Soundtrack%29+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dccd25c00661b143c93cf9eeb4837770306df32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,204,210,92,0,102,27,20,60,147,207,158,235,72,55,119,3,6,223,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
