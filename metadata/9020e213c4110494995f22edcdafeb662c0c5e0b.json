Fifi The Flea\n\nThis is the first studio recording from Mary Black in six years, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a collection that demonstrates an artist in full command of her bewitching vocal prowess. Throughout an impressive career, Mary has consistently demonstrated impeccable taste in her choice of material, and the evidence presented here suggests that her ear for seeking out songs of utmost grace and beauty is as keen as ever. With a voice that has only gained in depth and resonance over the years, Mary brings her trademark warmth and sincerity, casting light and shade amongst the lyrics to create her own personal space amongst the words of carefully chosen songwriters. Never one to rest on her laurels, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re gifted songs from familiar friends such as Shane Howard, Eric Bogle and Julie Matthews, alongside burgeoning writing talents, including Danny OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Reilly and Ricky Lynch.\n\nSharing the stage with a number of guests, Stories From The Steeples contains three duets: the beguiling ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLighthouse LightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ features Janis Ian in a perfectly balanced performance that whets the appetite for further exploration of this winsome partnership; the robust, soulful voice of Imelda May joins Mary on an affirmative song of place and belonging, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMountains To The SeaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½; and the playful ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWalking With My LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ finds Mary exchanging lines with the legendary Finbar Furey. All three performances are notable for their palpable sense of modesty and mutual admiration.\n\nTwo stand-out tracks come from particularly close to home, being written by MaryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s son, Danny OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Reilly. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFaith In FateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ paints a stark contrast between the sheer despair of a broken relationship with a determined hopefulness to move on and patch things up. Managing to be simultaneously bleak and uplifting with its heady infusion of hurt and devoted affection, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a song that plays to all the strengths of MaryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s typically emotion-wrought interpretation. Offering a similar cocktail of emotions, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWizard of OzÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a mournful reflection on the search for strength and happiness, underpinned by a dreamy string arrangement over which Mary lays her heartwarming vocals.\n\nFulfilling the role of storyteller, Mary excels in bringing lifelike colour to the characters of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMarguerite And The Gambler,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a Ricky Lynch song that recounts the familiar tale of many a traditional folk ballad, with its gamblers, true love, misguided familial intervention, heartbreak and devastation. Those purchasing the extended version of the album are handsomely rewarded with an exquisite reading of Chris WoodsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOne In A Million,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a story of true love that takes the mundanities of life and turns it in to utter magic, and proving beyond any doubt that Mary remains a songÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best friend.\n\nPaul KellyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThey Thought I Was AsleepÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ benefits from a tender reading, cloaked in MaryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s trademark warmth, depicting the torment of a child inadvertently witnessing from the back seat of a car, the emotional breakdown of his parentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ relationship. Equally devastating, though of more epic proportions, Eric BogleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAll the Fine Young MenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is made all the more disarming, thanks to the sheer reverence with which Mary furnishes this stark, anti-war anthem.\n\nWith a little less polish than some of her earlier releases, Stories From The Steeples steps forward as an intimate, unpretentious collection, bathed in a soft but radiant glow of effortlessness and wholehearted integrity. Time will tell, but Stories From The Steeples may well prove to be MaryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best yet.\n\nThe Sunday Times - by SM\n\nThere is something homely about Mary Black's songs, whether it's the tremors in her voice, or a sentimental tone, Black brings a certain familiarity as she flits between folk and Irish country. She rarely ventures out of her comfort zone, but the result is always a collection of elegant folk tales. Stories from the Steeples, Black's first studio album in six years, fits this pattern, despite the odd blast of Americana. The highlights include Mountains to the Sea, featuring Imelda May, while Lighthouse Light with Janis Ian, has a bluegrass-gospel warmth. Danny O'Reilly, the Coronas' frontman and Black's son, wrote three of the songs, including the blistering Wizard of Oz.\n\nHot Press, vol. 35, issue 22 - by Jackie Hayden: Assured Return By Irish Legend\n\nWith here first full studio outing in six years, Mary Black is back with an album on which she uncompromisingly showcases some of the most undeservedly unsung songwriters. The CoronasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Danny OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Reilly, (coincidentally her son), leads the pack, supplying three classy tracks. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Night Is On Our SideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is very good while, buoyed by BlackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s expressive vocal talents, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Faith In FateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is a true gem.\n\nWith the opener, the Dylanesque narrative ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Marguerite And The GamblerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, Black introduces us to the songsmithing skills of Ricky Lynch: Finbar Furey joins her on the jaunty ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“WalkinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ With My LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, creating a timeless duet that suggests they should do it again soon. Imelda May joins the fray on the upbeat ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Mountains To The SeaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, a colourful evocation of the outdoors from Australians Shane Howard and Neil Murray. The indomitable Richie Buckley lays his trademark sax on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Faith In FateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. Black and Janis Ian duet deliciously on the heart-stealing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Lighthouse LightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. And the album ends on a wistful note with BlackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Frenchified version of The HolliesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Fifi The FleaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.\n\nMary Black instinctively makes a song her own, and her voice here is more expressively fragile than before. The musicianship is impeccable, especially Bill ShanleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guitar and Pat CrowleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s keyboards, making Stories From The Steeples a very worthy addition to an already impressive catalogue. Mary: back in the BlackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nThe Irish Times, The Ticket - by SiobhÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n Long\n\nStories define Mary BlackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s latest collection, and quite a few have Antipodean roots: spare, sometimes parched, and shot through with an intimacy that lures the listener into the beating heart of the song. Danny OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Reilly of The Coronas contributes three of the best tracks, with The Wizard of Oz a standout: a story of heartbreak and tentative renewal celebrating the best of BlackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s interpretive skills against a spartan backdrop of piano, cello, violin and double bass. Guest vocalists include Janis Ian, Imelda May and Finbar Furey; their disparate styles at one with BlackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s. Paul KellyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s The Night Was Dark and Deep is neatly reinvented, and BlackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s three offspring get a peep-in on OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ReillyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s radio-friendly The Night Is on Our Side. Shades of Mary Chapin Carpenter colour this collection, whose main surprises are found lurking in the songwriting.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/02/16/mary-black/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/02/16/mary-black/&lt;/a&gt; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9020e213c4110494995f22edcdafeb662c0c5e0b","amp;dn":"Mary+Black...Stories+From+The+Steeples%292011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9020e213c4110494995f22edcdafeb662c0c5e0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,32,226,19,196,17,4,148,153,95,34,237,205,175,235,102,44,12,94,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
