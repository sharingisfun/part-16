A Russian president who needs to rein in his ambitious generals; an Indian prime minister experienced in the lethal consequences of the wrong decision; a Chinese president faced with competing forces within his country; and, in the White House, a man who tries to make peace with those who only want catastrophe. \n\nFlashpoint One - Pakistan; Flashpoint Two - North Korea \n\nThe opening stages are more confusing and terrible than those in any war in history. A terror attack on the Indian parliament kills hundreds. Hours later a North Korean missile hits a US military base in Japan. As the next few days unfold, those once counted as allies become enemies, and the comfortable lives of citizens in modern societies verge of physical and emotional collapse.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adeb019404185f3aeb23147591e03f4755861e21","amp;dn":"Humphrey+Hawksley++--+The+Third+World+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adeb019404185f3aeb23147591e03f4755861e21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,235,1,148,4,24,95,58,235,35,20,117,145,224,63,71,85,134,30,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
