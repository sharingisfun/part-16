He crosses paths with Stud Brown, and the two become an unlikely duo as they fight to clean up the 'hood, and make time for some lady loves they meet along the way. And hang on tight for the surprise twist ending. It's all living color kungsploitation glory, live with Cinematic Titanic.\n------------------------------------------------\n\nCinematic Titanic is a project by Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K) creator and original host, Joel Hodgson.[1] The project involves &quot;riffing&quot; B-movies, in a manner similar to that of MST3K.[2] Joining Hodgson are many of the original MST3K cast, as well as some cast members who joined later in the show's run.[3] These include Trace Beaulieu, J. Elvis Weinstein, Frank Conniff and Mary Jo Pehl.[4] It was first performed live on December 7, 2007 and first aired on December 22, 2007.\n\nOn February 16, 2013, it was announced that the touring portion of Cinematic Titanic was going on an indefinite hiatus. According to an email sent out to members of the site, due to &quot;5 people living in 5 different cities with different lives and projects, it has become increasingly difficult to coordinate our schedules and give Cinematic Titanic the attention it requires to keep growing as a creative enterprise and a business.&quot;[5] The final tour began on September 23, 2013.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48ad082669ae8360c6fae9b5388cee372928cbc4","amp;dn":"Cinematic+Titanic+-+08+-+East+Meets+Watts+%7B1974.DVDRip.XViD.AC3%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48ad082669ae8360c6fae9b5388cee372928cbc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,173,8,38,105,174,131,96,198,250,233,181,56,140,238,55,41,40,203,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
