To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the series, The Comic Strip Presents 'Five Go To Rehab', produced by Great Western Features and written by the original writer Peter Richardson, returns to the county where it all began.\n\nThree decades on, Dorset is still a magical land of rolling hills and ruined castles, but things have changed. The Five have failed to live up to their once priggish puritanical ideals and must confront today's modern world.\n\nAspect Ratio ...704x400\nFrame Rate  ....25\nBit Rate...........1000\nAudio Mp3 Stereo ...128","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e80a078fc63d5165c40e904e0b15039b5c45aa60","amp;dn":"The+Comic+Strip+Presents-5+Go+To+Rehab+Xvid-AJAXEN.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e80a078fc63d5165c40e904e0b15039b5c45aa60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,10,7,143,198,61,81,101,196,14,144,78,11,21,3,155,92,69,170,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
