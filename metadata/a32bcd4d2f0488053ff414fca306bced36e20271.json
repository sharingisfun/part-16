MacDonald. Unlike most detectives in crime fiction, McGee is neither a police officer nor a licensed private investigator; instead, he is a self-described &quot;salvage consultant&quot; who recovers others' property for a fee. McGee appeared in 21 novels, from The Deep Blue Good-by in 1964 to The Lonely Silver Rain in 1984. In 1980, the McGee novel The Green Ripper won the National Book Award.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_McGee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_McGee&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a32bcd4d2f0488053ff414fca306bced36e20271","amp;dn":"Travis+McGee+John+D.+MacDonald+Full+Series+mobi+kindle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a32bcd4d2f0488053ff414fca306bced36e20271","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,43,205,77,47,4,136,5,63,244,20,252,163,6,188,237,54,226,2,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
