ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also been described as a good mix of a masculine and feminine universe. Sepiamusic finds it difficult to place the music in a specific genre, because it holds elements of many different genres. Michael is inspired primarily by electronic music from the last 20 years. Erin also has a love for electronic music, but grew up listening to music from the 1940ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s to the 1970ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s. Sepiamusic is not about creating the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½sound of nowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, but creating the distinct sound of Sepiamusic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:399baf91baf1d7e6b4e5e8521be4489ebf1e132b","amp;dn":"Sepiamusic+-+Trenches+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"399baf91baf1d7e6b4e5e8521be4489ebf1e132b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,155,175,145,186,241,215,230,180,229,232,82,27,228,72,158,191,30,19,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
