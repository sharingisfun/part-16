This does not rate among the best Leadbelly collections: due to illness, his guitar skills had diminished by the 1948 sessions that comprise much of the disc, and there are better versions of some of the songs elsewhere. It's still plenty worthwhile, though, particularly when Leadbelly is boosted by Sonny Terry's vocal and harmonica on several numbers, including Leroy Carr's blues &quot;How Long, How Long.&quot; The CD is divided into thematic sections that, other than the '48 recordings, feature three patriotic tunes about U.S. efforts in World War II; five numbers recorded with Woody Guthrie and Cisco Houston in 1946, including the perennial favorite &quot;Midnight Special&quot;; and seven children-oriented selections.\n\n\nBooklet available here:\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://media.smithsonianfolkways.org/liner_notes/smithsonian_folkways/SFW40105.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://media.smithsonianfolkways.org/liner_notes/smithsonian_folkways/SFW40105.pdf&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7776cf3f6c991adb5243978c7147cc2a735d6d22","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Leadbelly+-+Shout+On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7776cf3f6c991adb5243978c7147cc2a735d6d22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,118,207,63,108,153,26,219,82,67,151,140,113,71,204,42,115,93,109,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
