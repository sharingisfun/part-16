The myriad of function calls, data structures, and options associated with the APIs are explained with well-chosen diagrams and tables.\n\n    *\n\n      After reading this book, the reader will be able to:\n    *\n\n      Differentiate basic datagrams vs. streaming sockets.\n    *\n\n      Differentiate unicast, broadcast, and multicast sockets.\n    *\n\n      Write socket-based network programs.\n    *\n\n      Write portable code for various OS&amp;#039;.\n    *\n\n      Implement client-server and peer communications\n    *\n\n      Increase network throughput using &quot;connectionless&quot; communications\n    *\n\n      Manage asynchronous I/O, I/O and multiple sockets.\n    *\n\n      Use signals, threading and processes to manage socket connections.\n    *\n\n      Understand new socket technologies like Mbone and 6bone.\n    *\n\n      Understand Remote Procedure Calls and how to implement them.\n    *\n\n      Understand the different socket addressing types.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1f2fdaa31d9746958825d3fc9e9f5eec3fb3756","amp;dn":"sams-Linux+socket+programming","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1f2fdaa31d9746958825d3fc9e9f5eec3fb3756","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,242,253,170,49,217,116,105,88,130,93,63,201,233,245,238,195,251,55,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
