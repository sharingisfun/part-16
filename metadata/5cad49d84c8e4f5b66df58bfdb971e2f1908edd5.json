The special is great!  However, the DVD contained no bonus features, which definitely displeased some fans.  Review: &quot;If you don&amp;#039;t get at least a half-dozen belly laughs from this compilation of outtakes from The Carol Burnett Show, you&amp;#039;d better check your pulse. Originally broadcast on CBS in 2001, this affectionate retrospective reunites the peerless cast of Burnett&amp;#039;s variety show--Burnett, Vicki Lawrence, Tim Conway, and Harvey Korman--to answer audience questions and reminisce. The cast recalls the many times they lost composure on camera, halting sketches due to all varieties of faux pas, from faulty props (or urinating horses) to mutual crack-ups. Culled from the show&amp;#039;s mid-1970s heyday, the clips are infectiously hilarious, and the cast never missed an opportunity to inject a little raunchiness (later deleted) into their otherwise wholesome entertainment. Conway&amp;#039;s the real conspirator here, frequently turning Korman into a helpless heap of giggles, and costume designer Bob Mackie (pulled from the audience) is given fair tribute for his outlandish creativity. TV like this doesn&amp;#039;t exist any more, and Show Stoppers will make you wonder why. --Jeff Shannon&quot;\n\nAmazon: http://www.amazon.com/Carol-Burnett-Show-Stoppers/dp/B00006G8I2\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0302389/\n\nTime: 42:28.171 Size: 733,501,440 Bytes\nVideo: XviD ISO MPEG-4 720x544 29.970fps 2173kbps\nAudio: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3 2 channel 48000Hz 114kbps VBR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cad49d84c8e4f5b66df58bfdb971e2f1908edd5","amp;dn":"Carol+Burnett+-+Show+Stoppers+%282001%29+DVDRip+XVID","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cad49d84c8e4f5b66df58bfdb971e2f1908edd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,173,73,216,76,142,79,91,102,223,88,191,219,151,30,47,25,8,237,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
