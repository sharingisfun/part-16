Oliver Reed, who will show up again as Rossetti in Dante's Inferno, is fantastic as the composer, using his obvious sexual swagger to suggest all manner of pent up emotions and ideas. The main theme that many of these films explore centers on the lack of success, the inability to gain sponsorship, and the various addictions that derive from same. As with many of his subjects, Russell appears very interested in the idea of lust, from both a personal and professional angle. Much of Debussy also finds the fictional director Vladek Sheybal bedhopping with Reed's various conquests, the fame whoring element of said women front and center. It makes for a wonderfully dense and delightful experience. \n\n________________________________________\n\n\nDVDrip\n\nDVD Source: DVD9\nDVD Format: NTSC\nProgram: Handbrake\nRuntime: 1:21:42\nLanguage: English\n\nEnglish Subtitles extracted as a srt file included\n\nVideo Codec -&gt; XviD\nAudio Codec -&gt; AC3\nFile Format -&gt; AVI\nTotal File Size -&gt; 1.49 GiB\nAverage bitrate -&gt; 2400 kbps\nFrame Width x Height -&gt; 640 x 480 pixels\nFrame Rate -&gt; 29.970 fps\nDisplay Aspect Ratio -&gt; 4/3\nVideo Standard -&gt; NTSC\nScan Type -&gt; Progressive\nAudio Stream BitRate -&gt; 192 Kbps ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec655740ff7044df6e2be77a0e255af2354a3913","amp;dn":"The+Debussy+Film+%28Ken+Russell%2C+1965%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec655740ff7044df6e2be77a0e255af2354a3913","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,101,87,64,255,112,68,223,110,43,231,122,14,37,90,242,53,74,57,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
