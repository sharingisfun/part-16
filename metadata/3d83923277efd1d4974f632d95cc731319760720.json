These form a vital part of the suspension system of any vehicle, essential for optimizing road holding, performance and safety.\n\nThis, the second edition of the Shock Absorber Handbook (first edition published in 1999), remains the only English language book devoted to the subject. Comprehensive coverage of design, testing, installation and use of the damper has led to the bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s acceptance as the authoritative text on the automotive applications of shock absorbers. In this second edition, the author presents a thorough revision of his book to bring it completely up to date. There are numerous detail improvements, and extensive new material has been added particularly on the many varieties of valve design in the conventional hydraulic damper, and on modern developments such as electrorheological and magnetorheological dampers. The text is generously illustrated throughout with numerous diagrams and photographs.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Shock Absorber Handbook, 2nd EditionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ provides a thorough treatment of the issues surrounding the design and selection of shock absorbers. It is an invaluable handbook for those working in industry, as well as a principal reference text for students of mechanical and automotive engineering.\n\n \n\nAbout the Author\nDr John C.
