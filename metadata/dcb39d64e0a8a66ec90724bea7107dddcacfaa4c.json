And instead of\nrepeating Everything But the Girl records with her\nhusband Ben Watt, she&amp;#039;s branching out and working\nwith other artists including Metro Area, The Rapture\nand electro-house power-producer Ewan Pearson. It\nwill be her first solo release since A Distant Shore\nin 1982.\n\n&quot;I&amp;#039;ve got together with a few different\nproducers/collaborators, and we&amp;#039;ve come up with a\nrecord that (I hope) is a true reflection of who I\nam right now and what I love right now,&quot; said Thorn.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcb39d64e0a8a66ec90724bea7107dddcacfaa4c","amp;dn":"Tracey_Thorn-Out_Of_The_Woods-%28Advance%29-2007-uF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcb39d64e0a8a66ec90724bea7107dddcacfaa4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,179,157,100,224,168,166,110,201,7,36,190,167,16,125,221,202,207,170,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
