Harry Blamires helps readers to negotiate their way through this formidable, remarkable novel and gain an understanding of it which, without help, it might have taken several readings to achieve.\n\nTHE NEW BLOOMSDAY BOOK is a crystal clear, page-by-page, line-by-line running commentary on the plot of Ulysses which illuminates symbolic themes and structures along the way.  It is a highly accessible, indispensible guide for anyone reading Joyce's masterpiece for the first time.\n\nTo ensure that Blamires' classic work will remain useful to new readers, this third edition contains the page numbering and references to three commonly read editions of Ulysses: the Oxford World Classics' (1993), the Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics' (1992), and the Gabler Corrected Text (1986) editions.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:770f29b460fb11436ea7063780050783c25e37fd","amp;dn":"Blamires+-+New+Bloomsday+Book%3A+A+Guide+Through+Ulysses+%283rd+ed.%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"770f29b460fb11436ea7063780050783c25e37fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,15,41,180,96,251,17,67,110,167,6,55,128,5,7,131,194,94,55,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
