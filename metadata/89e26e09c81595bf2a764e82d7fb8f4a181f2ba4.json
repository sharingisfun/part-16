TodayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fashionable philosophies often treat metaphysics as a petrified relic of the past, and hold that future progress requires an ever further abandonment of all claims to discuss reality in itself. Guerrilla Metaphysics makes the opposite assertion, challenging the dominant &quot;philosophy of access&quot; (both continental and analytic) that remains quarantined in discussions of language, perception, or literary texts. Philosophy needs a fresh resurgence of the things themselvesÃ¢â‚¬â€not merely the words or appearances themselves.\nOnce these themes are adapted to the needs of an object-oriented philosophy, what emerges is a brand new type of metaphysicsÃ¢â‚¬â€a &quot;guerrilla metaphysics.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Guerrilla-Metaphysics-Phenomenology-Carpentry-Things/dp/0812694562/ref=pd_sim_b_2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Guerrilla-Metaphysics-Phenomenology-Carpentry-Things/dp/0812694562/ref=pd_sim_b_2&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89e26e09c81595bf2a764e82d7fb8f4a181f2ba4","amp;dn":"Guerilla+Metaphysics+Graham+Harman+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89e26e09c81595bf2a764e82d7fb8f4a181f2ba4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,226,110,9,200,21,149,191,42,118,78,130,215,251,143,74,24,31,43,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
