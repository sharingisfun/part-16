His music draws deeply from the blues, American folk music, modern poets and philosophers. \n\n\nReview:\nBlues-folk icon Chris Smither has long been revered for both his guitar prowess and his way with a lyric, inspiring artists from Bonnie Raitt and John Mayall to Emmylou Harris and Diana Krall.\nAs Smither marks his 50th year of music-making in 2014, the New Orleans-raised troubadour takes a look back at his career with Still On the Levee, a two-CD retrospective releasing on Mighty Albert/Signature Sounds.\nReconnecting with his roots, Smither recorded Still on the Levee at New OrleansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Music Shed with longtime producer David Goodrich. Their aim was to give fresh perspective to a selection of songs from his vast career Ã¢â‚¬â€ from Ã¢â‚¬Å“Devil Got Your Man,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ his first composition, to recent originals. Among those who joined him on the project are\nfamed pianist Allen Toussaint, members of the band Morphine and fellow folk-Americana artists Wainwright, Kris Delmhorst and Rusty Belle. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a family affair, with backing-vocal contributions by SmitherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sister, Catherine Norr, and fiddling by his daughter, Robin.\nRating 4/5\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n\nCD 1\n01 - Devil Got Your Man (04:39)\n02 - Don't It Drag On (03:12)\n03 - No More Cane On The Brazos (01:57)\n04 - Love You Like A Man (02:32)\n05 - Rosalie (04:22)\n06 - Lonesome Georgia Brown (02:26)\n07 - A Song For Susan (with Rusty Belle) (04:05)\n08 - Another Way To Find You (03:32)\n09 - 'Deed I Do (with Catherine Norr) (03:35)\n10 - Link Of Chain (04:16)\n11 - Train Home (with Allen Toussaint) (04:17)\n12 - Lola (03:54)\n13 - Leave The Light On (with Rusty Belle &amp; Robin Smither) (03:31)\n\nCD 2\n01 - Hold On (03:49)\n02 - Shillin' For The Blues (with EEWB) (04:04)\n03 - No Love Today (with Allen Toussaint) (04:47)\n04 - What They Say (with Loudon Wainwright III) (02:44)\n05 - Slow Surprise (03:16)\n06 - Can't Shake These Blues (03:53)\n07 - Call Time (03:23)\n08 - Up On The Lowdown (03:37)\n09 - Seems So Real (04:42)\n10 - Small Revelations (with EEWB) (04:12)\n11 - Winsome Smile (with Rusty Belle) (04:12)\n12 - Leave The Light On (with Rusty Belle) (04:24)\n\n\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry: USA\nGenre: Folk, rock, blues\n\n\nMedia Report:\nSource : CD\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : ~720-956 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2775160a8f58b592c2a40327fdabf117d8656464","amp;dn":"%282014%29+Chris+Smither+-+Still+On+the+Levee+2CD+%5BFLAC%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2775160a8f58b592c2a40327fdabf117d8656464","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,117,22,10,143,88,181,146,194,164,3,39,253,171,241,23,216,101,100,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
