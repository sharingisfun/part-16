The series is a western-themed reworking of Gilligan's Island.\n\nThe series, set in the latter 19th century, is about a small, diverse cluster of lost travelers, who become separated from their wagon train.\n\nTwo coachmen and five passengers of a wagon and stagecoach become separated from their wagon train on the way to California in the early 1870s. The group includes wagonmaster Mr. Callahan and his shotgun lookout Dusty, Mr. and Mrs. Brookhaven (a wealthy Eastern banker and his wife), book-smarts thinker Andy, dance-hall girl Lulu McQueen, and farm girl Betsy. The show follows their adventures while they attempt to return to their wagon train. According to the theme song, &quot;...Dusty's the reason for their plight, thanks to Dusty Ã¢â‚¬â€œ nothing's right&quot;.\n\nDusty's Trail was not a direct spin-off of CBS's Gilligan's Island, but it reworked the &quot;lost&quot; premise into the Western genre. Each character was analogous to a Gilligan's Island prototype. Dusty was an analog of Gilligan (Denver); Mr. Callahan an analog of The Skipper (Alan Hale, Jr.); a wealthy senior couple (Mr. and Mrs. Brookhaven) was analogous to the Howells, a flashy vamp (Lulu) was analogous to Ginger, an intellectual (Andy) was analogous to the Professor, and the &quot;girl next door&quot; (Betsy) was an analog of Mary Ann.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty%27s_Trail&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty%27s_Trail&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51bf58ec2353978d07f595afb6ff0c83ddf7e37b","amp;dn":"Dusty%27s+Trail+-+1973-74+Western+Comedy+%7BBob+Denver+-+4+Eps%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51bf58ec2353978d07f595afb6ff0c83ddf7e37b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,191,88,236,35,83,151,141,7,245,149,175,182,255,12,131,221,247,227,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
