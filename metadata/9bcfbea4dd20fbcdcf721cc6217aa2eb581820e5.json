It was recorded live at Fairfield Halls, Croydon and the Oz Benefit Concert, London, July 1971 and released in September of that year. It was recorded during Dave Mason's third stint with the band, which lasted only six performances.\n\nThe tracklist includes one song each from the first three Traffic albums; two songs from Mason's first solo album, Alone Together; and Gimme Some Lovin' from Steve Winwood's former band, the Spencer Davis Group.\n\nAlthough regarded as a Traffic album, it was originally released without the name &quot;Traffic&quot; anywhere on it; credited instead to the seven individual musicians. Nonetheless the Traffic logo appeared on the cover (on the back, in this case) as on all of their albums.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n&quot;Medicated Goo&quot; (Miller/Winwood) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34 \n&quot;Sad and Deep as You&quot; (Mason) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:48 \n&quot;Forty Thousand Headmen&quot; (Capaldi/Winwood) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:21 \n&quot;Shouldn't Have Took More Than You Gave&quot; (Mason) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:39 \n&quot;Dear Mr. Fantasy&quot; (Capaldi/Winwood/Wood) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 10:57 \n&quot;Gimme Some Lovin'&quot; (Davis/Winwood/Winwood) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:02 \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSteve Winwood- Vocals, Organ, Electric Piano, Guitar \nChris Wood- Sax, Flute, Electric Piano, Organ \nJim Capaldi- Drums, backing vocals \nDave Mason- Vocals, Lead Guitar, Acoustic Guitar \nJim Gordon - Drums \nRebop Kwaku Baah- Congas, Timbales, Bongos \nRic Grech- Bass ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bcfbea4dd20fbcdcf721cc6217aa2eb581820e5","amp;dn":"Traffic+-+%5C%27Welcome+To+The+Canteen%5C%27+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bcfbea4dd20fbcdcf721cc6217aa2eb581820e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,207,190,164,221,32,251,205,207,114,28,198,33,122,162,235,88,24,32,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
