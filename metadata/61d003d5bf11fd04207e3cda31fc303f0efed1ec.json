To study all available methodologies would be the work of a lifetime, however, there is a core set of techniques that every computer graphics professional should understand in order to envision and expand the boundaries of what is possible in their work.\n\nThis authoritative reference is a consolidated guide to the seminal techniques of mathematical optimization as applied to computer graphics and vision.\n\nIt provides a conceptual overview of the key problems in computer graphics and explains the core mathematical models that can be used to solve them, demonstrating their pivotal importance.\n\nIt aids readers in finding the right optimization technique for a specific application by providing combinatorial, continuous, variational, and global optimization methods for applications including:\n\nCamera Calibration\nColor Correction\nGeometric Modeling\nAnimation\nVisualization\nCoding and Compression\nImage Processing\nComputer Vision\nImage and Color Quantization\nLevel of Detail Computation\nInteractive Visualization\nMinimum Paths in Maps\nSurface Reconstruction from Sections\n\nAlgorithms, such as Newton methods, linear programming, conjugate gradient and sequential quadratic programming, Dijkstra, and Branch-and-bound, are explained alongside strategies for devising good algorithms. Special emphasis is given to the subtle relationships between probability theory and mathematical optimization. Cutting-edge research is discussed in a section at the end of every chapter, accompanied by targeted references to further reading.\n\nProfessionals exploring computer vision, geometric modeling, visualization, animation, and image processing will all benefit from the insights of the authors, who are renowned researchers from IMPA, the Brazilian National Institute for Pure, and Applied Mathematics.
