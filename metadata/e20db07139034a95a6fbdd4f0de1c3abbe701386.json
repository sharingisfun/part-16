One year on, a full explanation of \n       what might have happened has emerged.\n       \n       This film brings together an independent team of leading air crash \n       investigators to provide the first credible solution to the \n       mystery of flight 447. Conducting their own tests and simulations \n       using the available evidence, they painstakingly piece together a \n       convincing scenario of what they believe happened. Their \n       conclusions raise worrying concerns about aviation's increasing \n       reliance on automated flight systems.\n\n\n\n       Note: 20 minutes longer than NANO release.\n\n\n                             Big up all scene massive!\n\n\n    \n                                       \n                GROUP  INFORMATION          \n         9 Years of the Force and still    \n                      going strong                  \n     \n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n           * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n           * also we have a contest to annouce we are in need of a\n           * new nfo ascii artwork design email us with your designs\n           * winners artwork will be added as our new nfo\n           * dont forget to tag your work\n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc\n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;3a7c5548595f7a524f4952145b53&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e20db07139034a95a6fbdd4f0de1c3abbe701386","amp;dn":"Lost.The.Mystery.Of.Flight.447.UNCUT.WS.PDTV.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e20db07139034a95a6fbdd4f0de1c3abbe701386","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,13,176,113,57,3,74,149,166,251,221,79,13,225,195,171,190,112,19,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
