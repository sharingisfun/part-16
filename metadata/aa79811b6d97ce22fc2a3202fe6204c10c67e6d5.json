Ben Rogers.**\n\nBen Rogers grew up as an ordinary, happy child in a loving family in Staffordshire, England. But despite his privileged start in life, Ben became a heroin addict. During his last months, Ben kept a video diary of his drug use and desperate attempts to come off heroin. Ravaged by the drug, Ben's body began to break down: he developed DVT and his veins were rendered so useless he had to inject into his groin. Despite his family's best efforts, Ben couldn't stop. He was haunted by, and hooked on, heroin.\n\nDirector Olly Lambert comments: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s incredibly rare to come across such raw and unflinching footage of a man so close to an abyss. I was speechless when I first watched it.  I hope the film finishes what Ben had begun: to give people a visceral understanding of the nature of addiction.  It has been a privilege to try and unpick who Ben really was using the intimate legacy heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s left behind.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The documentary also contains comments by Ben's family.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 349 MiB for 44mn 40s 80ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English UK\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Documentary\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 946 Kbps\nAspect            : 576 x 352 (1.636) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 134 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa79811b6d97ce22fc2a3202fe6204c10c67e6d5","amp;dn":"Sky1-Ben%3ADiary+of+a+Heroin+Addict+%282008%29.WS-PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa79811b6d97ce22fc2a3202fe6204c10c67e6d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,121,129,27,109,151,206,34,252,42,50,2,254,98,4,193,12,103,230,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
