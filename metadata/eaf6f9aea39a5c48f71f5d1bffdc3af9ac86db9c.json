This is NOT the old 4kids nor is it the International Dub (A.K.A Rai English) This takes place after the specials.\nTo inform old fans, Winx of course is NOT an American cartoon, it was NOT created by 4Kids, they only made a horrid dub of it. Its a cartoon from Italy and Nickelodeon in my opinion, is treating it very well. This is why the music, voices and script may appear different for fans who grew up with 4kids. However be assured that this dub is very faithful to the Italian version. So far the only thing Nick has changed is one minor character's name from Season 4. That's a pretty good track record for an American dub of a foreign cartoon adapted for kids tv.\n\nFormat MPEG-4\n\nEnjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eaf6f9aea39a5c48f71f5d1bffdc3af9ac86db9c","amp;dn":"Winx+Club+Season+3+%7BEps+7-13%7D+Nickelodeon+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eaf6f9aea39a5c48f71f5d1bffdc3af9ac86db9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,246,249,174,163,154,92,72,247,31,93,27,255,220,58,249,172,134,219,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
