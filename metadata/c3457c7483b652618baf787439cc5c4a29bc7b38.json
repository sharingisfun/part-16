He played with a fluid, syncopated fingerstyle guitar technique, common among many exponents of Piedmont blues, although, unlike his contemporaries, he used exclusively a twelve-string guitar. As well as this, McTell was an adept slide guitarist, unusual among many ragtime bluesmen. His vocal style, a smooth and often laid-back tenor, differed greatly from many of the harsher and more expressive voice types employed by Delta bluesmen such as Charlie Patton. McTell embodied a variety of musical styles, including blues, ragtime, religious music, and hokum.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCheck out my other torrents!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3457c7483b652618baf787439cc5c4a29bc7b38","amp;dn":"Blind+Willie+Mctell+-+Library+of+Congress+recordings","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3457c7483b652618baf787439cc5c4a29bc7b38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,69,124,116,131,182,82,97,139,175,120,116,57,204,92,74,41,188,123,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
