Tulyev seeks information on a purported Soviet nuclear weapons facility while playing cat-and-mouse with KGB counterintelligence.\n\nRich with Cold War themes and Soviet cultural references, The Secret AgentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Blunder will be enjoyed by fans of realistic espionage drama (cf. le CarrÃƒÂ©) and Sovietophiles alike.\n\nThe first installment in the Secret Agent series: The Secret AgentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Blunder (1968), The Secret AgentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Destiny (1970), The Secret AgentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Return (1982), and The End of Operation Ã¢â‚¬Å“Secret AgentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (1986). Russian president Vladimir Putin, a former KGB agent himself, has stated that his career as an intelligence officer was prompted in part by ZhzhonovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s performance in these films.\n\nThis version is the result of efforts to improve both the video and subtitles from the low-quality Ruscico DVD. Video has been exactingly cleaned up as follows:\n\n- Cropped windowboxing (source DVD is overcropped on the sides, unfortunately)\n- Stabilized gate weave\n- Removed flickering\n- Removed chroma noise (rainbowing and yellow tinting)\n- Corrected / balanced levels\n- Recovered details and reduced aliasing\n- Cleaned noise and banding\n- (See the before / after reel and bottommost screenshot below)\n\nSubtitles have been edited line-by-line for readability and accuracy. There are two English subtitle tracks, identical save for format:\n\n- Default track: lower resolution IDX (VobSub) format; compatible with many standalone media players\n- Secondary track: high resolution SSA format; recommended if watching on a computer\n\nTechnical details:\n\n- B&amp;W, 25 fps, 696x352\n   - (Resolution unaltered from DVD except for removal of black windowboxing)\n   - (Displayed at 742x352 with 1.066 PAL pixel aspect ratio)\n- 48 kHz, 192 Kbps mono AC3 (unaltered DVD original)\n- x264 in MKV","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11aaf9e624acb539f9bcbc48ff7350249c6409a7","amp;dn":"The+Secret+Agent%27s+Blunder+%28%D0%9E%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%BA%D0%B0+%D0%A0%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0+%2F+Oshibka+Rezidenta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11aaf9e624acb539f9bcbc48ff7350249c6409a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,170,249,230,36,172,181,57,249,188,188,72,255,115,80,36,156,100,9,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
