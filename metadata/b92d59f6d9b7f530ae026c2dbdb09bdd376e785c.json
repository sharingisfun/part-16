But since there seems to be a lot &quot;similarly&quot; &lt;cough&gt; named rips now I guess I should explain.\n I try to present the &quot;ultimate mastering&quot; of a particular LP, the &quot;mastering&quot; is not my equipment or process but the source material, it has always been about finding the best source. Now my opinion of the best source is subject\n to change as I experience more variations. Whether or not folks think my rip is &quot;definitive&quot; is irrelevant to me, I just try to find the best pressing and don't mind doing the extra clean up that comes with not just ripping new reissues or japanese issues. I understand the appeal of these pressings but I don't subscribe to the notion that they represent the best source 95% of the time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b92d59f6d9b7f530ae026c2dbdb09bdd376e785c","amp;dn":"%5B24%2F96%5D+Hard+Stuff+-+Bulletproof+-+1972%2C+Bolex+Dementia-+1973%2C+V","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b92d59f6d9b7f530ae026c2dbdb09bdd376e785c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,45,89,246,217,183,245,48,174,2,108,45,189,176,155,221,55,110,120,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
