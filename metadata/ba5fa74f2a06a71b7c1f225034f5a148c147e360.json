I tweaked the colors and sharpness\n\nyou can improve the sharpness even more by using vlc real time sharpener\nfilter and slide the knob to find the sweet spot\nits turns vhs and tv videosfrom blur to clear pixels but vlcs sharpen boosts\nthe brightness of whites which can see in the eyes of faces of people\n\n\nsadly the source ripper slightly over cropped it.. trimmed the top and bottom\nlogos too much by 4 pixels but just makes the logos look a little silly\nI dont think the main picture has lost pixels\n\ntake it or leave it.. but i suspect a hstv ver will show up in 6 to 12 hours\n\n\nEnjoy and HELP to seed will be slow until other torrents seed out\nso lets hope no hit and runs\n\n\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba5fa74f2a06a71b7c1f225034f5a148c147e360","amp;dn":"Gold.Rush.S03E02.Enhanced.MQTVRip.xvid-%5D%5B+The+Wrong+Claim+%5D%5B+03-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba5fa74f2a06a71b7c1f225034f5a148c147e360","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,95,167,79,42,6,167,27,124,31,34,80,52,245,161,72,193,71,227,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
