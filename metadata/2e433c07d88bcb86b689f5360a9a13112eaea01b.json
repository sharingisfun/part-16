Full Descriptionin post-bop jazz history, it's predecessor IN A SILENT WAY--though less widely acknowledged--was perhaps even more revolutionary for its dissolution of the songform-oriented cool jazz approach and introduction of electric instruments. This three-disc set, featuring all the material laid down in those vaunted 1969 sessions, is a revelatory sonic document that further illuminates the maverick genius of Miles Davis. \n\nIn addition to the original SILENT WAY tracks as we know them, there are previously unheard compositions and alternate versions that shed new light on Miles's process. &quot;The Ghetto Walk,&quot; for example, which was never released before in any form is a slow-burner that features some of new arrival John McLaughlin's most expansive, questing guitar work (partially due to Miles's penchant for springing new, unrehearsed material on his musicians). The shifting, kaleidoscopic keyboard work of Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, and Joe Zawinul (what a trio!), gives another undiscovered gem &quot;Early Minor&quot; a haunting, ethereal feel. \n\nAdditionally, the full, unedited versions of tunes included on the original album give an idea of producer Teo Macero's groundbreaking cut-and-paste editing process. For anyone interested in the evolution of modern jazz, THE COMPLETE IN A SILENT WAY SESSIONS is an essential item.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisc: 1\n01.
