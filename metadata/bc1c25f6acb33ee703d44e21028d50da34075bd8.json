Moving through yoga postures while using the exercise ball is meditation in motion. It allows you to engage several muscle groups simultaneously to create a total body workout and to lose weight naturally as your metabolism increases with special breathing techniques. The exercise ball provides a soft and cushioning base for the strong stretches and graceful movements of the yoga exercises, and with only a slight roll of the ball, the deep stretches can be altered to target different areas of the muscles.\nThe complete workout lets you choose between sculpting your muscles with cardiovascular and muscle-toning exercises or relaxing your body and mind with stretching and breathing exercises. Yoga on the Ball pairs breathing and movement to create a rejuvenating flow of energy that will realign your mind and body, leaving you feeling calm, strong, and centered.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc1c25f6acb33ee703d44e21028d50da34075bd8","amp;dn":"Yoga+on+the+Ball%3A++Yoga+Practice+Using+the+Exercise+Ball","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc1c25f6acb33ee703d44e21028d50da34075bd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,28,37,246,172,179,62,231,3,212,78,33,2,141,80,218,52,7,91,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
