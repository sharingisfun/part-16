A five piece instrumental firebreathing fusion monster led by guitarist John McLaughlin which incorporated jazz, east Indian and rock elements, their loud, fast and complex music caught the gaze of jazz purisists, fans of the fledgling early 70s progrock movement as well as the curious. Even Andres Segovia sat up and took notice of the appearance of this spectacular musical phenomenom.\n\nThis 5 CD box contains the first five Mahavishnu Orchestra albums. The five classic Mahavishnu Orchestra albums, no less. Only The Lost Trident Sessions is missing here and this would had been full house.
