If you really like this game then download it and try it. If it doesn't work on newer operating systems then you can only play it in a virtual machine like VMware running Windows 95/98 or XP.\n\n\nEnjoy &amp; Please Seed!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3db0304add70f0162413d2c26855a36d91d34a5","amp;dn":"Take+No+Prisoners+%5BPC%5D+%5BENGLISH%5D+%5BFULL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3db0304add70f0162413d2c26855a36d91d34a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,219,3,4,173,215,15,1,98,65,61,44,38,133,90,54,217,29,52,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
