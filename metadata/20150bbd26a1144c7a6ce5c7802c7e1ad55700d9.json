A disturbing tale of Aboriginal magic in the West Country is told by one score-keeper to another (Alan Bates &amp; Tim Curry) at an insane asylumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s staff/patient cricket match.\n\nThe story centres on the cuckolding of a musician (John Hurt) by an enigmatic stranger (Bates), who claims to have the power to kill with his special shout.\n\nThe plot though engaging is slight, however the direction is subtle and performances impressive. A disquietening atmosphere pervades the film; good use is made of sound and music.\n\nAlso, a young Jim Broadbent does his best to be noticed in a small role. \n\n\nDirector: Jerzy Skolimowski\nCast: Alan Bates, Susannah York, John Hurt, Tim Curry, Robert Stephens. \n\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: The.Shout.1978.DVDRip.XviD-iNSPiRE.avi\nFilesize.....: 699 MB (or 715,832 KB or 733,011,968 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:22:30 (123,752 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1061 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 115 kb/s (57/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.93\nFrame Size...: 560x304 (1.84:1) [=35:19]\n\n\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
