The author has carefully selected key texts, many of them not previously available in English, and provided them with comprehensive commentaries.\nFor the Greek polis, warfare was a more usual state of affairs than peace. The documents assembled here recreate the social and historical framework in which ancient Greek warfare took place - over a period of more than a thousand years from the Homeric Age to Alexander the Great. Special attention is paid to the attitudes and feelings of the Greeks towards defeated people and captured cities.\nComplete with notes, index and bibliography, Warfare in Ancient Greece will provide students of Ancient and Military History with an unprecedented survey of relevant materials","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48f81f6d1aa8a37cac7392edd79219f2e3687905","amp;dn":"Warfare+in+Ancient+Greece%3A+A+Sourcebook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48f81f6d1aa8a37cac7392edd79219f2e3687905","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,248,31,109,26,168,163,124,172,115,146,237,215,146,25,242,227,104,121,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
