It contains candid interviews with dozens of astronomers, geologists, biologists, and writers about the origin and range of terrestrial life and likely sites for life beyond Earth. The interviewees discuss what we've learnt from the missions to Mars and Titan, talk about the search for Earth clones, describe the surprising diversity of life on Earth, speculate about post-biological evolution, and explore what contact with intelligent aliens will mean to us. Covering topics from astronomy and planetary science to geology and biology, this book will fascinate anyone who has ever wondered 'Are we alone?'","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90385f5f80b524b2279d537630d64f4b78959d25","amp;dn":"talking+about+life+conversation+on+astrobiology-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90385f5f80b524b2279d537630d64f4b78959d25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,56,95,95,128,181,36,178,39,157,83,118,48,214,79,75,120,149,157,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
