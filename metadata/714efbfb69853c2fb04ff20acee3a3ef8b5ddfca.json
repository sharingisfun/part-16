We start by examining the core elements of WinForms by building an application just using code. Once we understand the foundation of Windows Forms, we turn our attention to the tooling included in Visual Studio. We then look at some common application layouts, building a complete application for each. Next is an examination of the data binding features of Windows Forms. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll bind to simple objects, DataSets and LINQ to SQL entities. Finally we see how we can easily deploy Windows Forms applications using ClickOnce.\n\n\nAuthored by: Rob Windsor \nDuration: 5h 51m \nLevel: Beginner \nReleased: 8/15/2013\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:714efbfb69853c2fb04ff20acee3a3ef8b5ddfca","amp;dn":"Pluralsight+-+Introduction+to+Windows+Forms+-+altaf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"714efbfb69853c2fb04ff20acee3a3ef8b5ddfca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,78,251,251,105,133,60,47,176,79,242,10,206,227,163,239,139,93,223,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
