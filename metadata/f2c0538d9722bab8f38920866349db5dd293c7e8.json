Nevertheless, Wood and Lynne were determined to \nmaintain some differentiation between the sound of their two groups \n[for example, by confining Wood's saxes to Message and Wood's cellos to the ELO debut]\n\nThe Move was also responsible for the cover, as the painting \nwas done by Roy Wood, based on an idea by Jeff Lynne.\n\n\nThe Move, from Birmingham, England, were one of the leading British rock bands of the\n1960s. They scored nine Top 20 UK singles in five years, but were among the most\npopular British bands not to find any success in the United States.\n\nAlthough bassist-vocalist Chris &quot;Ace&quot; Kefford was the original leader, for most of their\ncareer The Move was led by guitarist, singer and songwriter Roy Wood. He composed\nall the group's UK singles and, from 1968, also sang lead vocals on many songs,\nalthough Carl Wayne was the main lead singer up to 1970.\n\nThe group evolved from several mid 1960s Birmingham based groups, including Carl\nWayne and the Vikings, the Nightriders and the Mayfair Set. The group's name referred\nto the move various members of these bands made to form the group. Beside Wood,\nthe original five-piece line-up of The Move in 1965 was drummer Bev Bevan, bassist\nKefford, vocalist Carl Wayne and guitarist Trevor Burton. The final line-up of 1972 was\nthe trio of Wood, Bevan and Jeff Lynne, who transitioned the group into the Electric\nLight Orchestra.\n\n\n\nDigitally remastered expanded edition of the final Move album that included Bev Bevan,\nRoy Wood and Jeff Lynne, who would eventually disband the group to form Electric\nLight Orchestra. Amid the 8 added bonus tracks are the original single plus an alt\nversion of &quot;Do Ya&quot;, one of the groups last recordings that would become a hit for ELO\nlater in the decade. This edition is released in celebration of the 35th Anniversary of the\ngroup's signing to EMI Records. Includes the hidden track &quot;My Marge&quot; [Alt Version] at\nthe end of the 17th chapter.\n\nThe Move: Roy Wood [vocals, guitar, steel guitar, clarinet, oboe, bassoon, saxophone,\nbass guitar]; Jeff Lynne (vocals, guitar, piano, electric piano, percussion); Bev Bevan\n[drums, percussion]\n\n\n\n  01.
