The 1994 soundtrack release was completely re-recorded and some of the tracks were not even performed by Vangelis. \n\nHereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an excellent review from Bladezone.com ;\n\n\n-------------------\nReview by Sebastian.\n\n\nThis is it. Don't look any further. Had I known this release was on its wayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ I would have found it difficult to give many of the other Blade Runner bootlegs the maximum rating in the past. \nThis &quot;Esper Productions&quot; double cd private release isÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ to dateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ the most comprehensive and accurate Blade Runner version to see the light of day. Where every other BR bootleg faltersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ this version is resilient. I believe it's as close as we've ever come to the &quot;Ultimate Blade Runner Soundtrack&quot; so far. With so many Blade Runner boots out thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ many reading this review might be askingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ &quot;so what's the big deal?&quot; I'll give it a shot:\n\nBasicallyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ this release parts on a similar premise of the 2000 OWM release (i.e. a double disc release trying to take music from every BR source) but takes this idea much farther with never-before-heard\nmusic and excellent production quality. For the first timeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ this release has virtually ALL of the music from the film (Directors Cut and 1982 theatrical release). Highlights of new goodies on these\ndiscs:\n\n- Most noteworthyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ this release debuts &quot;Thinking of Rachael&quot; - the shorter and different take of the Love ThemeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ (heard only in the 1982 theatrical release where Deckard dozes off on his piano). A first on any release.\n\n- For the first timeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ the incidental music heard when Deckard wakes RachaelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ just before their escape at the end of the film is present on the track titled &quot;Rachael Sleeps.&quot;\n\n- At long lastÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ (as in the film itself) the eerie electronic rumblings leading into the &quot;Love Theme&quot; is expanded and presented in its complete formÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ titled &quot;I am the Business.&quot; (The recent Deck Music and Deck Art releases decide to &quot;chop up&quot; this sequence into several parts for no apparent reason).\n\n- Incidental music from the Esper photo examination film sequence is present on the track titled &quot;Esper Analysis.&quot;\n\n- The &quot;Prologue and Main Titles&quot; track contains the original &quot;LAÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ November 2019&quot; sound effect cue leading into the Main TitlesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ as heard in the film itself. (The Deck Music and Deck Art releases\nlayered a spinner effect over it).\n\n- The track titled &quot;Deckard Enters the Bradbury&quot; also has expanded musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ not heard on any BR release.\n\n- For the first timeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ the complete &quot;Tears in Rain&quot; dialog is presented here (i.e. &quot;time to die&quot; omitted from other versions).\n\n- LastlyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ this release contains interesting new mixes and transitionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ (i.e. the fusion featured on the track titled &quot;Sushi Bar-Damask Rose&quot;).\n\nAs gathered from reading many BR reviews in the pastÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ some fans might find the brief dialog sequences distractingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ preferring the musical purity principle of the &quot;Gongo&quot; or &quot;BR 2001&quot; releases. NonethelessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ it's clear that this Esper Productions release is extremely true to the film's atmospheric offerings while presenting all of the major themes in a very coherent and original manner. For thisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ and it's many new additions I find this &quot;Esper Edition&quot; BR release as close to perfection as it gets. TrulyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ a must have.\n\n***** (5/5 stars)\n\n-------------------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:493df9fd17501dc4814b7d7fdb7bc3c9cfe8638d","amp;dn":"Blade+Runner+Soundtrack+-+The+Esper+Edition+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"493df9fd17501dc4814b7d7fdb7bc3c9cfe8638d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,61,249,253,23,80,29,196,129,75,125,127,219,123,195,201,207,232,99,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
