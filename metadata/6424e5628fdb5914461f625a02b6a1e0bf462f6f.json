The band \nmembers include producers  Josh  Gabriel  and Dave  Dresden,  singer and \nsongwriter Mavie Marcos, and guitarist David Penner. The band performs a \nmix of  trance,  rock and house,  combining live instruments and vocals, \nblended with elements of electronica.  Andain first entered the scene in \n2002 with the debut single Summer Calling, making their breakthrough the \nfollowing year with the second single Beautiful Things. Remaining silent \nafter the success  of  their  hit  single,  the band made  a  subsequent \nappearance on Gabriel &amp; Dresden's 2004 compilation album Bloom, with the \ntrack Here is the House,  a cover  of  Depeche Mode.  The band was later \nannounced to be working on new material,  but due  to  high demands from \nother projects of Josh and Dave,  the band  was temporary suspended.  By \nthe end of 2006, Dave announced that the album was put back on schedule, \nand the production was once again resumed.\n\n\n************************************************************************\n\nTracklist\n\n************************************************************************\n\n\n01.
