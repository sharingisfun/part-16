Yeah, me too. It\nwas one of my favourite movies when I was a kid. When it was released on DVD back\nin 2004 I was very disappointed with what I saw. Although the picture was slightly\nimproved, there were so many differences that it felt like a completely different\nmovie. So I decided to make my own cut to resurrect the original version.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de61ed10d17b75c62e150eb660414661dddd26e6","amp;dn":"No+Retreat%2C+No+Surrender%3A+The+Fan+Cut","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de61ed10d17b75c62e150eb660414661dddd26e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,97,237,16,209,123,117,198,46,21,14,182,96,65,70,97,221,221,38,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
