Whether it's a literal strongbox, an empty coffin, the inner workings of a scientist's mind, or an underground prison cell, there are those who will use any means necessary to unlock the secrets of...THE MYSTERY BOX.\r\n\r\nWith this anthology, bestselling author Brad Meltzer introduces twenty-one original stories from today's most prominent mystery writers. In Laura Lippman's &quot;Waco 1982,&quot; a young reporter stuck with a seemingly mundane assignment on lost-and-found boxes unwittingly discovers a dark crime. In Joseph Finder's &quot;Heirloom,&quot; a scheming neighbor frightens the new couple on the block with an unnerving tale of buried treasure. In R.L. Stine's &quot;High Stakes,&quot; a man on his honeymoon gets drawn into a bizarre bet involving a coffin--a bet he may pay for with his life.\r\n\r\nFrom the foothills of Mount Fuji to Georgia's Okefenokee Swamp, from a physics laboratory in wartime Leipzig to an unusual fitness club in Boca Raton, these sometimes terrifying, sometimes funny, and always suspenseful tales will keep you riveted to the page","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5a134b1fcd10a7ce0020674168a0124495e2177","amp;dn":"The+Mystery+Box+-+Brad+Meltzer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5a134b1fcd10a7ce0020674168a0124495e2177","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,161,52,177,252,209,10,124,224,2,6,116,22,138,1,36,73,94,33,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
