Enjoy!!\n\nRelease Notes:-\n=============\n\nThis patch and crack made by sam2k8 and i have only uploaded this torrent for those who do not want to download the complete game again and again and want to play with Dlc's because with skidrow crack dlcs do not work. It includes all released dlc's but you need your game updated till patch 1.9 so use skidrow patch or some thing else. You can change name from LumaEmu.ini which is in your main install folder.\n\nUploader Note:-\n==============\nIt is working perfectly and i will recommend this for those who don't want to download 11gb skidrow updates very time the game is updated.\n\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ff8a60b11379fca7dfa0e3f7f89086f40502ce7","amp;dn":"Sleeping+Dogs.Update+v.2.0..Incl.All.DLC%27s-P2P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ff8a60b11379fca7dfa0e3f7f89086f40502ce7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,248,166,11,17,55,159,202,125,250,14,63,127,137,8,111,64,80,44,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
