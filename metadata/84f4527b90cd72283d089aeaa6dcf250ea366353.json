A true war wages, and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re invited. ITÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S AN INVITATION you may not be able to accept if you want to, or decline if you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an invitation to fight in a war like no other; a war where loss is counted as gain, surrender as victory, and where the enemy you must face, an enemy of unimaginable superiority, is yourself. Spiritual Warfare issues a damning and irrefutable indictment of its own audience and genre, putting spirituality and religion themselves on trial. Spiritual Warfare is a sharp-edged book for those who want to experience a direct and authentic spirituality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84f4527b90cd72283d089aeaa6dcf250ea366353","amp;dn":"Jed+Mckenna+-+Spiritual+Warfare","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84f4527b90cd72283d089aeaa6dcf250ea366353","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,244,82,123,144,205,114,40,61,8,154,234,166,220,242,80,234,54,99,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
