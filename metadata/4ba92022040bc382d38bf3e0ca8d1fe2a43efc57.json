Here he vies with Tom Kasansky (Val Kilmer) for the coveted &quot;Top Gun&quot; award. When not so occupied, Mitchell carries on a romance with civilian consultant Charlotte Blackwood (Kelly McGillis). Shaken up by the death of a friend, Mitchell loses the Top Gun honor to Kasansky. Worried that he may have lost his nerve, Mitchell is given a chance to redeem himself during a tense international crisis involving a crippled US vessel and a flock of predatory enemy planes. The story wasn't new in 1986, but Top Gun scored with audiences on the strength of its visuals, especially the vertigo-inducing aerial sequences. The film made more money than any other film in 1986 and even spawned a 1989 takeoff, Hot Shots. An Academy Award went to the Giogio Moroder-Tom Whitlock song &quot;Take My Breath Away.&quot;\n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 50 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ba92022040bc382d38bf3e0ca8d1fe2a43efc57","amp;dn":"Top+Gun%281986%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ba92022040bc382d38bf3e0ca8d1fe2a43efc57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,169,32,34,4,11,195,130,211,139,243,224,202,141,31,226,164,62,252,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
