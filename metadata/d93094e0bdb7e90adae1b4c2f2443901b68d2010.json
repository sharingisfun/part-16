Do common cats constitute a major threat to wildlife? Will the development of new chemical and biological weapons deter war or lead to it? If you want students to think, really think, about the science behind some of today's toughest controversies, this book will give you the facts and the framework to provoke fascinating debates.\nClones, Cats, and Chemicals examines 10 dilemmas from the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, Earth science, technology, and mathematics and helps you challenge students to confront scientific and social problems that offer few black-and-white solutions. Each question is presented as a two-part unit: concise scienttific background with possible resolutions and a reference list for further teacher reading, and a reproducible essay, questions, and activities to guide students in debating and decision making.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d93094e0bdb7e90adae1b4c2f2443901b68d2010","amp;dn":"Clones%2C+Cats%2C+And+Chemicals%3A+Thinking+Scientifically+About+Contr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d93094e0bdb7e90adae1b4c2f2443901b68d2010","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,48,148,224,189,183,233,10,218,225,180,194,242,68,57,1,182,141,32,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
