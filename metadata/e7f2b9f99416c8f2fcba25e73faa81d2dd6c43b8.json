ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an outstanding album, filled with committed performances and loping, hypnotic grooves. Njava is capably backed up by an array of musicians on bass, rhythm guitar and a range of handheld percussion. Most of all, though, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the voice that is the focus here, in service to the songsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ beautiful melodies and muscular arrangements. The excellent musicianship melds with the voice to create a powerful, mesmerizing musical stew.\n\nTrack List\n\n1. Soa Gnanay (4:25)\n2. Dinako (4:20)\n3. Sweet Lullaby (4:04)\n4.
