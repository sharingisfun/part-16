Confidential, Rolo Tomassi's uncompromising sound incorporates an eclectic blend of math-hardcore, acid-jazz, and progressive punk. Influenced by U.S. metallers Converge, prog rockers King Crimson, and jazz saxophonist John Coltrane, lead singer Eva Spence, her brother, keyboardist James Spence, guitarist Joe Nicholson, bassist Joseph Thorpe, and drummer Edward Dutton formed the band in Sheffield in 2005. A regular fixture on their local rock circuit, they released various self-funded EPs through indie label Holy Roar before signing to Hassle Records in 2008. In the same year, they performed at Download Festival, supported Gallows and Throats on their U.K. tours, and released their debut album, Hysterics. In 2010, they recorded their follow-up, Cosmology, with M.I.A.producer Diplo, collaborated with Biffy Clyro for a performance on Channel 4, and released a compilation, Eternal Youth, featuring 36 previously unreleased tracks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ccf9d3a4896988f412112a1d1a07f1b9589f0fd","amp;dn":"Rolo+Tomassi+-+Discography+%282005-2012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ccf9d3a4896988f412112a1d1a07f1b9589f0fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,207,157,58,72,150,152,143,65,33,18,161,209,160,127,27,149,137,240,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
