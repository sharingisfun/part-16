It's a three-song trio performance with Jimmy Smith, Quentin Warren (guitar) and Donald Bailey (drums). This video is a must see for anyone interested in jazz organ.\n\n----------\n\nJimmy Smith single-handedly made the Hammond B-3 organ an important voice in jazz music. Smith was a true virtuos and his impact on jazz cannot be overstated.\n\nHis legendary multi-part technique, playing bass lines with the foot pedals and/or the left hand, and solo passages with his right hand, is a jazz landmark. He played piano and bass before he switched to the organ. This combination proved an essential element of his approach at the organ.\n\nSmith explains his development:\n&quot;I got my organ from a loan shark and had it shipped to the warehouse. I stayed in that warehouse, I would say, six months to a year. I would do just like the guys do - take my lunch, then I'd go and set down at this beast. Nobody showed my anything, man, so I had to fiddle around with my stops.&quot;\n\nSmith was born in 1928 in Norristown, near Philadelphia, and died February 8, 2005, in his sleep at his Scottsdale, Arizona, home.\n\n----------\n\nRecommended five-song-starter for those who are new to Jimmy Smith:\n\n1. Organ Grinder Swing (1965 - Start with the short title track. This is a strong organ trio record with a groaning Jimmy at the helm, and the best start for those who are new to Jimmy Smith)\n2. Jimmy And Wes: The Dynamic Duo (1966 - the jazz guitar giant Wes Montgomery and Smith. Listen to 'Road Song')\n3. The Cat (1964 - with a tight and dynamic big band. Turn up the volume and listen to the title track)\n4. Live At The Village Gate (1963 - live organ trio with blues frenzy. Listen to Jimmy given time to stretch out during all 8 minutes of 'I Got A Woman')\n5. Root Down (1972 - live funk band. Root down and get it)\n\n----------\n\nThis is not a complete discography, but rest assured that this collection includes all records considered influential by Jimmy Smith: 'The Sermon', 'Back at the Chicken Shack', 'Crazy! Baby', 'Bashin': The Unpredictable Jimmy Smith', etc.\n\n'The definitive...', 'Jazz Masters...', 'Roots Of Acid Jazz...', 'Compact Jazz...', 'Retrospective...' and other compilation albums are not included, as tracks from compilation albums are already covered by this collection.\n\n----------\n\nThis collection is in MP3-format.\n\nLow quality rips, low bitrates and LP rips have been avoided, except when these were the only sources available.\n\nMany albums have covers and liner notes provided, but not every album. You will find many photos of old LP covers, and LP side photos, even though the tracks comes from CD's. In some cases you will find more tracks than the original LP cover lists, and the reason is that additional tracks and/or alternate takes have been added for the included reissue of the record.\n\nAll songs are tagged by the book.\n\nFor watching the video under Windows, use e.g. VideoLan VLC Mediaplayer or DivX Player.\n\nIf you encounter errors during the file sharing, please, place this material as close to the root of the hard disk as possible and restart the file sharing (e.g. as close as possible to C: in Windows). This is in order to make the path (drive, directory and filename) as short as possible. Operating systems have limits regarding how long a path including the filename can be, and if this limit is exceeded there will be errors.\n\n----------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0070fcf85e77aaa8eb2b392e2eac4371446438e6","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Smith+-+78+albums+and+Jazz+Scene+USA+1962+-+Jazz+Organ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0070fcf85e77aaa8eb2b392e2eac4371446438e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,112,252,248,94,119,170,168,235,43,57,46,46,172,67,113,68,100,56,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
