Both have reputations for complexity. But the basic ideas behind relativity and quantum physics are, in fact, simple and comprehensible by anyone. As Professor Wolfson points out, the essence of relativity can be summed up in a single sentence: The laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion.\n\nThe same goes for quantum theory, which is based on the principle that the &quot;stuff &quot; of the universeÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥matter and energyÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥is not infinitely divisible but comes in discrete chunks called &quot;quanta.&quot;\n\n\n\nMore info on their site:     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.teach12.com/tgc/courses/Course_Detail.aspx?cid=153&amp;pc=Professor6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.teach12.com/tgc/courses/Course_Detail.aspx?cid=153&amp;pc=Professor6&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------\nCompression mini tutorial (hope I stimulate others to compress):\n\n1. get SUPER (it's freeware and can convert everything to everything)\nSUPER RULEZ:D\n\n\n2. modify settings like this (or cut a little portion of video, then play around):\n 2.1 codec H264\n 2.2 set video width X 288 (width/288 must be equal to originalWidth/originalHeight)\n 2.3 set video bitrate somewhere between 240-270. I set it 240:P I didn't go lower.\n 2.4 set audio: mp3, audio bitrate 56kbs, sample rate 22050Hz\n\n3. Hit the button:D\nYou should get videos somewhere around 60-90 mb.\n\nThat's all\n(of course, then you create a torrent, then upload to tpb:D)\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bded4543fc028ddf96b4d283ed6d06f8bc712591","amp;dn":"TTC+-+Modern+Physics+For+Non-Scientists+%28compressed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bded4543fc028ddf96b4d283ed6d06f8bc712591","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,237,69,67,252,2,141,223,150,180,210,131,237,109,6,248,188,113,37,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
