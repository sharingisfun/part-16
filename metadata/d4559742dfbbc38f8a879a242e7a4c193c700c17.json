Funny? Maybe, if it is a joke, not a human life ... He became an outcast. Tribesmen were afraid of him, despised, and then erased from his life, chased away and forgotten forever. His name is Ico, and now he is in the castle. The castle has no title, Ico does not know how got there and could not find a way out. But he is not alone in his confinement. Beside him Jordi, first, accepted it for what it is, first, from whom he had not received the rudeness and ridicule.\nTogether they must find a way out of the stone trap, but without your help it will be difficult. Corridors and cold rooms strange castle - not the most hospitable places on earth. In the booming labyrinths meet evil spirits, and for the next threshold can not wait for a death trap. However, Ico is strong and brave, he had a weapon and he was able to stand up for themselves and for Jordy, and a wonderful companion, too, is not helpless.
