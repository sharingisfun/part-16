Methodologies include: divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy strategies. Applications involve: sorting, ordering and searching, graph algorithms, geometric algorithms, mathematical (number theory, algebra and linear algebra) algorithms, and string matching algorithms. Analysis of algorithms is studied - worst case, average case, and amortized - with an emphasis on the close connection between the time complexity of an algorithm and the underlying data structures. NP-Completeness theory is examined along with methods of coping with intractability, such as approximation and probabilistic algorithms.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc3fb7851af6afd4328801cfbc9efdb067e26662","amp;dn":"Algorithms+-+By+Shai+Simonson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc3fb7851af6afd4328801cfbc9efdb067e26662","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,63,183,133,26,246,175,212,50,136,1,207,188,158,253,176,103,226,102,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
