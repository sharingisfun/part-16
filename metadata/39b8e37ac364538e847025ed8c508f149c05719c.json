Together they constitute the world's largest piece of sculpture.\n\nThe story of Mount Rushmore's creation is as bizarre and wonderful as the monument itself. It is the tale of a hyperactive, temperamental artist whose talent and determination propelled the project, even as his ego and obsession threatened to tear it apart. It is the story of hucksterism and hyperbole, of a massive public works project in the midst of an economic depression. And it is the story of dozens of ordinary Americans who suddenly found themselves suspended high on a cliff face with drills and hammers as a Danish sculptor they considered insane directed them in the creation what some would call a monstrosity, and others a masterpiece.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39b8e37ac364538e847025ed8c508f149c05719c","amp;dn":"American+Experience+-+Mt+Rushmore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39b8e37ac364538e847025ed8c508f149c05719c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,184,227,122,195,100,83,142,132,112,37,237,140,80,143,20,156,5,113,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
