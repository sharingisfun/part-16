The story involves Freemasons against Catholics, Garibaldi against the Bourbons, Russian spies, German double agents, murky murders, plotting prelates, black masses and orgies.\nIf all this sounds like a richly sensational read, you couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be more wrong. Although the book starts promisingly when Simonini finds a mysterious priest seemingly living a Jekyll and Hyde existence, the narrative is soon overwhelmed by obscure historical detail and repetitive situations where only the personnel changes.\nEcoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s black humour is really a single joke that wears thin, and all in all this is a truly tedious slog, relieved only by its punctuation with engravings from the authorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s private collection, each one leaving the reader counting the pages until the next.\n\n\nRead more: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/books/article-2062712/Umberto-Eco-THE-PRAGUE-CEMETERY.html#ixzz1e4K7PS1X\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:036ed1797bb78ed82629d7b84291b1d1b40e8f3d","amp;dn":"The+Prague+Cemetery+-+Umberto+Eco%2Cepub%2Cmobi%2CKK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"036ed1797bb78ed82629d7b84291b1d1b40e8f3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,110,209,121,123,183,142,216,38,41,215,184,66,145,177,209,180,14,143,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
