The band had relocated to London by 1970, and they released their self-titled debut album in 1971. Both Nazareth and 1972's Exercises received favorable attention by British hard rockers, but it was 1973's Razamanaz that moved them into the U.K. Top Ten (both &quot;Broken Down Angel&quot; and &quot;Bad Bad Boy&quot; were hit singles). Loud 'n' Proud and Rampant (both 1974) followed the same formula, yet were slightly less successful.
