He is the group's primary songwriter, producer and vocalist, as well as frequent multi-instrumentalist. The Magnetic Fields is essentially a vehicle for Merritt's songwriting, as are various side-projects, such as The 6ths, Future Bible Heroes and The Gothic Archies. While the musical style of the band is as malleable as Merritt's songwriting, its songs are commonly attributed to pop genres such as synthpop, indie pop, and noise pop. The band is often cited[citation needed] as being recognizable by Merritt's lyrics, often about love and often with irregular or neutral gender roles, that are by turns ironic, tongue-in-cheek, bitter, and humorous.\n\nTracklist:\n1.BBC Radiophonic Workshop 0:22\n2.Desert Island 3:36\n3.Deep Sea Diving Suit 2:05\n4.Strange Powers 2:41\n5.Torn Green Velvet Eyes 4:22\n6.The Flowers She Sent And The Flowers She Said She Sent 2:26\n7.Swinging London 2:35\n8.In My Secret Place 1:41\n9.Sad Little Moon 2:12\n10.The Trouble I've Been Looking For 2:23\n11.Sugar World 3:19\n12.All You Ever Do Is Walk Away 2:05\n13.In My Car 2:56\n14.Take Ecstasy With Me 3:36\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry: USA\nGenre: Indie\n\n\nMedia Report:\nSource : CD\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : ~591-1000 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97f0242615588e6addeb5399ee766c238857f5d5","amp;dn":"%281994%29+The+Magnetic+Fields+-+Holiday+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97f0242615588e6addeb5399ee766c238857f5d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,240,36,38,21,88,142,106,221,235,83,153,238,118,108,35,136,87,245,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
