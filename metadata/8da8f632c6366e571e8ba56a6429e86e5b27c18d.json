Release: 1992. \n\n\n\nLife's Like Poetry is a gigantic, 12-disc box set that includes all of Lefty Frizzell's recordings for Columbia and ABC, plus early demos, a session with Jay Miller, and several radio transcriptions -- everything he recorded between 1950 and 1975. Certainly, the box is designed for collectors -- no one but the most devoted fan could listen to all 330 tracks. Though all of his classic material is included, there is also a fair share of mediocre material, including some ill-advised attempts at country-pop. Nevertheless, there are gems sprinkled throughout the collection and it offers proof of his far-reaching talents and influence, as well as demonstrating that several of Lefty's later recordings were as worthwhile as his early singles. For any serious fan, it is an indispensible collection. \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8da8f632c6366e571e8ba56a6429e86e5b27c18d","amp;dn":"Lefty+Frizzell+-+Life%27s+Like+Poetry+%5B1950-1974%5D+Bear+Family+12CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8da8f632c6366e571e8ba56a6429e86e5b27c18d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,168,246,50,198,54,110,87,30,139,165,106,100,41,232,110,91,39,193,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
