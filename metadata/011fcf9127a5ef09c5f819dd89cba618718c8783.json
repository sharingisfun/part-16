It introduced new readers to the work of Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and other Marvel creators, and packaged the material in a traditional book format that carried more cachÃƒÂ© than the flimsy pamphlet style of a typical comic book. Many of the books featured painted covers illustrated by such artists as Bob Larkin, John Romita, Sr., and Earl Norem. In this way, the series was an antecedent to the now common practice of packaging &quot;classic&quot; stories into archival editions and trade paperback collections including Marvel's 1998 book Grandson of Origins of Marvel Comics.\n\n------\n\nYou can also check out http://members.tripod.com/adams_fan/fireside.html for a ton of useful info on the whole series.\n\n------\n\nThis is a follow-up to my Origins of Marvel Comics and my Bring on the Bad Guys torrents. I came across this one published in 1977, the same year as The Superhero Women which I was actually searching for. THE MIGHTY MARVEL SUPERHEROESÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ COOKBOOK is the 8th (or so) trade paperback, published by Fireside/Simon &amp; Schuster after ORIGINS, SON OF ORIGINS, BAD GUYS, WOMEN, a STRENGTH &amp; FITNESS BOOK and two FUN BOOKs.\n \nThis cookbook is hilarious! Words cannot express how amused IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been while reading through this. \n\nI donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what I expected, but I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t foresee:\n1. A full-page splash of Spider-Man wearing a chefÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hat with flames blazing out of the oven behind him.\n2. A certain armored Avenger yelling Ã¢â‚¬Å“I get my iron from beef liver!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n3. The covertly racist choice of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ70s African-American hero Goliath serving up meatloaf -- a dish of brown meat. **shaking my head**\n4. Shang-ChiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rice (see #3)\n5. Howard the Duck on the back cover but not in the book, probably luckily for him.\n\nThe extent of this bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lavish illustrations by Joe Giella (IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never heard of him) also surprised me. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actually a beautiful product. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just damn weird!\n\nThis one's 96 pages.
