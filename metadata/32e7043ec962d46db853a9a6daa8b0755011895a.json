That which is now called learning, was not learning originally. Learning does not consist, as the schools now make it consist, in the knowledge of languages, but in the knowledge of things to which language gives names.\n\nThe Greeks were a learned people, but learning with them did not consist in speaking Greek, any more than in a Roman&amp;#039;s speaking Latin, or a Frenchman&amp;#039;s speaking French, or an Englishman&amp;#039;s speaking English. From what we know of the Greeks, it does not appear that they knew or studied any language but their own, and this was one cause of their becoming so learned; it afforded them more time to apply themselves to better studies. The schools of the Greeks were schools of science and philosophy, and not of languages; and it is in the knowledge of the things that science and philosophy teach that learning consists.\n\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _ \\ / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n\\_)_____)\\___ \\_____|\\_) \\__)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| \\__|___/\n(_____|\n\n\n-LEGAL TORRENTS\n\nPurpose:\n\ncreate a balance, share the already free stuff,\npublic domain works, freeware, free music,\nfree ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.\n\nshow the copyright owners that torrent\nwebsites shouldn&amp;#039;t bear the responsibility\nof what their users upload, torrent websites\nare very much similar to google..\n\nusers upload what they want to upload,\ndownload what they want to download,\nand search for what they want to search..\n\nby creating this balance and sharing the already free\nstuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _ \\ / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n\\_)_____)\\___ \\_____|\\_) \\__)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| \\__|___/\n(_____|","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32e7043ec962d46db853a9a6daa8b0755011895a","amp;dn":"The+Age+of+Reason+eBooK+-LegalTorrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32e7043ec962d46db853a9a6daa8b0755011895a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,231,4,62,201,98,212,109,184,83,169,166,218,168,176,117,80,17,137,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
