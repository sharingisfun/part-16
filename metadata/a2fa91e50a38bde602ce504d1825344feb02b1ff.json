A terrific read by a top scholar.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Bart Ehrman, author of Misquoting Jesus\n\n Boston UniversityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cutting-edge religion scholar Jennifer Wright Knust reveals the BibleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contradictory messages about sex in this thoughtful, riveting, and timely reexploration of the letter of the gospels. In the tradition of Bart ErhmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Jesus Interrupted and John Shelby SpongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sins of Scripture, KnustÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Unprotected Texts liberates us from the pervasive moralizingÃ¢â‚¬â€the fickle dos and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢tsÃ¢â‚¬â€so often dictated by religious demagogues. KnustÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful reading offers a return to the scripture, away from the mere slogans to which it is so often reduced.\n\nepub","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2fa91e50a38bde602ce504d1825344feb02b1ff","amp;dn":"Unprotected+Texts%3A+The+Bible%27s+Surprising+Contradictions+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2fa91e50a38bde602ce504d1825344feb02b1ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,250,145,229,10,56,189,230,2,206,80,77,24,37,52,79,235,2,177,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
