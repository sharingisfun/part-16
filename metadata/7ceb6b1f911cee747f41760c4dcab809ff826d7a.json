She is a rare artist... She is genuine.\nI went to the concert in London (15 March 2005) just before Laura went to Paris and had a great time and even though I have never met her, her delight, her joy, her spirit is sincere; you see that sincerity in the concert and in the interview in the bonus material.\n\nIf you're a fan, you have to get this DVD and even if you're not a fan you will still admire that she is a great singer and has a fantastic voice.\n\nI also recommend the latest album - Resta in Ascolto or the Spanish version (Escucha Atento) for which Laura won a Grammy. I've been translating it (or trying to!) and found the lyrics to be profound and meaningful (to me anyway!). \n\n.: Cover :.\n\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\n1. Gente\n2. Emergenza D'amore\n3. Vivimi\n4.
