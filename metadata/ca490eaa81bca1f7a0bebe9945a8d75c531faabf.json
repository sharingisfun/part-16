Very worth watching - it's a story about politics and church, leading rural family life after the WW2 in Slovenija, producing comedy, ending in a tragic realization of the ways of the politics, taking down the naive, ignorant and innocent.\n\nThe movie is very well at showing the rural life after World War 2 and the Communist Revolution.
