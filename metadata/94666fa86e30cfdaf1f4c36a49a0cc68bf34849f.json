A killer at the top of his profession. A man with a rifle who can change the course of history. A man unknown to any secret service in the world. \n\nThe Jackal has a new and extremely dangerous contract: to kill Charles de Gaulle, the world's most heavily guarded man. And as the minutes count down to the final act of execution, it seems that there is no power on earth that can \nstop the Jackal. \n\nDefinitely among the all-time greats.\n\n\n\nEditorial Reviews:\n\n&quot;The Day Of The Jackal makes such comparable books as The Manchurian Candidate and The Spy Who Came In From The Cold seems like Hardy Boy mysteries.&quot; -- The New York Times\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94666fa86e30cfdaf1f4c36a49a0cc68bf34849f","amp;dn":"Frederick+Forsyth+-+The+Day+of+the+Jackal+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94666fa86e30cfdaf1f4c36a49a0cc68bf34849f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,102,111,168,110,48,207,218,241,244,195,106,73,160,204,104,191,52,132,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
