Pretty easy to just pick up and play, the game's got a pretty deep setting going on, too. Check it if you dig that style.\n--------------------------------------\n\n\nDescription:\nReturn with us to the days when men were sprites (and so were women and dragons and kings). When 256 colors seemed like a luxury and games were known more for their gameplay than their flashy graphics. Inaria is an RPG created in that style, but with modern interface conveniences that make it easier to play, giving the best of both worlds.\nInaria is a land divided. The above-dwelling Humans and the subterranean Slorn had long been at peaceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦until a new Slorn King pushed his people into war with the surface. Many cities fell to the Slorn onslaught, but one held Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Emerald, the last free city of Inaria.\nAs a citizen of Emerald, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve decided that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time for you to join the fight. While the main forces prepare their defenses, King Gianfranco sends you on a seemingly impossible missionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦to destroy the Slorn King himself.\n\nKey Features:\n-Classically inspired graphics\n-Huge dungeons to explore\n-Tons of different enemies to fight\n-RPG mechanics that reward you no matter how you choose to create your character\n-A plot of intrigue and deception, where things arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t as simple as they seem\n-Superb retro-styled music courtesy of H. Arnold Jones\n\nRequirements:\nInaria runs on any Windows computer, including netbooks!\n\n\n--------------------------------------\n*Absolutely 100% clean and working!*\n*My upload ain't the best, but I'll seed this forever!*\n*BUY the games you reallllly dig!!!*","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:483ea92cc4858fef64c22e2950d57f5f8d1e0505","amp;dn":"Inaria+1.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"483ea92cc4858fef64c22e2950d57f5f8d1e0505","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,62,169,44,196,133,143,239,100,194,46,41,80,213,127,95,141,30,5,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
