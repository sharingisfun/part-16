Wikipedia swears that:\n\nDoc Stearn...Mr. Monster is a fictional character comic book superhero created by Michael T. Gilbert, most recently published by Dark Horse Comics. The character first appeared in Pacific Comics Vanguard Illustrated #7 (July 1984). Later the character graduated to his own monthly series Doc Stearn...Mr. Monster from Eclipse Comics. Mr. Monster was derived from an old 1940's character appearing in only one issue of a defunct Canadian Comic who had lapsed into public domain, Gilbert heavily revised the character creating a Horror/Humor hybrid which often featured heavy satire of both horror as well as comics in general.\n\nThis torrent contains all Vanguard Illustrated #7, the entire 10-issue run at Eclipse and whatever other series and one-shots I could piece together from Mr. Monsters peripatetic publishing history. Get it, seed it! Many thanks to the creators and scanners!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27f9f42cbbcb69fdd3c3b29869780153126e5fc0","amp;dn":"Mr.+Monster+%28Eclipse%2C+others%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27f9f42cbbcb69fdd3c3b29869780153126e5fc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,249,244,44,187,203,105,253,211,195,178,152,105,120,1,83,18,110,95,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
