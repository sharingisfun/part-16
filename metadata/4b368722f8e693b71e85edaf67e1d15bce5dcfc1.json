It has the breadth and depth of an advanced system but is designed to be simple and straightforward in use.\n\nLx comes from a 100% community-driven association that believes in the values of free software &amp; collaboration and whose founding values are development, equality, co-operation, openness, freedom, group achievement, independence, and solidarity.\n\nOpenMandriva Lx 2014.0 implements Linux kernel 3.13.11 nrjQL, which improves the desktop system performance and responsiveness. The default desktop environment for OpenMandriva Lx 2014.0 is KDE Plasma 4.12.4. Xorg has been updated to version 1.15.1, Mesa has been updated to version 10.1.1, LibreOffice 4.2.3 has been implemented by default, the latest Firefox 29 with the Australis theme has been added, Java 7 is now used by default, the support for printing has been improved, and a Welcome to OpenMandriva Lx introduction is now provided at first boot. This is also the first version of OpenMandriva LX that is capable of EFI booting, which means that users will be able to install it on a system that has UEFI (some problems might still linger).\n\nRelease announcement: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://blog.openmandriva.org/2014/05/a-breath-of-fresh-air-with-a-kde-soul-openmandriva%C2%AD-lx-2014-is-burning-free/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://blog.openmandriva.org/2014/05/a-breath-of-fresh-air-with-a-kde-soul-openmandriva%C2%AD-lx-2014-is-burning-free/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b368722f8e693b71e85edaf67e1d15bce5dcfc1","amp;dn":"OpenMandriva+Lx+2014.0+%2864-bit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b368722f8e693b71e85edaf67e1d15bce5dcfc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,54,135,34,248,230,147,183,30,133,237,175,103,225,209,91,206,93,207,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
