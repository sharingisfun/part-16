Her father, Frederick (Walter Pidgeon), who owns a music conservatory, accepts a teaching position in England.\nAboard ship, Annette encounters the American promoter James Sullivan (Victor Mature) and his associate Doc Cronnol (Jesse White), who are taking a boxing kangaroo called Sidney with them to London.\nThe teaching position falls through and Jimmy suggests promoting Annette in a six-mile swim to Greenwich. She volunteers to make it 26 miles instead. Word spreads of the swim and Annette's feat makes news.\nJimmy suggests they can make a fortune by going to New York and appearing in Alfred Harper's (David Brian) water ballet at the Hippodrome. They are not offered a job in the show, so Annette goes to Boston for a highly publicized swim and gets in hot water for wearing a one-piece suit too revealing for its time.\nShe and Jimmy have a misunderstanding and part ways. Harper has a change of heart and makes Annette headliner of his New York show. Lonely after the death of her father, Annette goes to Florida at the behest of Doc to try to dissuade Jimmy from flying in an air race with a $50,000 prize. It does not go well.\nAs time passes, Harper falls in love with Annette while she travels to Hollywood to make a film. Jimmy and Doc turn up, this time promoting a dog called Rin Tin Tin that they hope to star in the movies.\nA water tank bursts during the making of Annette's film, causing her serious injury, Spinal Hematoma. With her future in doubt, Harper steps aside when he sees for himself how much Annette and Jimmy are in love.\n\n&quot;Million Dollar Mermaid&quot; not only became Esther Williams' nickname around Hollywood, but it became the title of her autobiography (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1999), co-written with Digby Diehl. Williams has often called this her favorite film. \n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Bitrate: 1295 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime: 115 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]   \nDuration: 115 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c36858cceeec0675ecd7d5ceb0fbc422285dbe8","amp;dn":"Million+Dollar+Mermaid+%281952%29+Xvid+1cd+-+Esther+Williams%2C+Victor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c36858cceeec0675ecd7d5ceb0fbc422285dbe8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,54,133,140,206,238,192,103,94,205,125,92,235,15,188,66,34,133,219,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
