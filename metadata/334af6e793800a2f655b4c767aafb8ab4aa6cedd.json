True, most of their issuesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½spousal abuse, divorce, cancer, step-parenting, single motheringÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½aren't new. Some contributors, like Mariane Pearl, the widow of journalist Danny Pearl, have even published their thoughts elsewhere. What's magical about this collection, though, is what happens when such diverse accounts are stitched together in a single volume: a new picture emerges of what it means to be a mother in modern America. \n\nChemo treatments may leave you bald. Your kids may suffer from &quot;KGOYÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½kids growing older younger,&quot; and as they test your limits, you may find yourself &quot;morphing into some authoritarian freak.&quot; If you're black, people may assume you're your own child's nanny. But as one woman discovered traveling solo to Cairo to see a particular set of Roman-era memorial portraits in the Egyptian Museum, the acknowledgment &quot;of death, of loss, of suffering, as well as of desire and remembered joy&quot; is all &quot;part of living.&quot; Skip the flowers and candy this Mother's Day, and buy this book instead.
