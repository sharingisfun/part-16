This book is designed to show you how to use Python (in combination with the raw processing power of your computer) to accomplish real-world tasks in a more efficient way. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t look for an exhaustive description of the Python languageÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œyou wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find it. The bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s main purpose is not to thoroughly cover the Python language, but rather to show how you can use Python to create robust, real-world applications.\n\nThis book is framed around the code itself. This is because developers are typically looking for how to do something; and, as with many activities, you learn how to do something by watching how others do and trying it yourself. If you want to know how a for loop works, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find for loops in my code, but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not the thrust of the book. Instead, this book shows you how to do things: how to build a content management system, how to build a test management system, how to set up a system for tracking customer follow-up, and so on. Along the way, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to communicate with a SQL database, how to act as a web server or communicate with one, how to access operating system services, and more.\n\nFrom the Back Cover\nPython: Create-Modify-Reuse\n\nAimed at all levels of Python developers who are interested in a task-based way of learning Python development, this hands-on book shows how you can efficiently use Python to create robust, real-world applications. After a brief primer on this object-oriented, interactive programming language, you will jump right into practical Python development so that you can create useful, streamlined scripts that are easy to maintain and enhance, and that you can immediately put to use in the real world.\n\nEach chapter features a complete project that you can use as it currently exists or modify to suit your particular purposes. Among these projects youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find applications that access databases, take advantage of web technologies, facilitate network communications, and more. Plus, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also explore more advanced topics such as accessing operating system resources, writing scripts that are easy to read and maintain, and debugging and testing. However, even more important than the technologies you will be introduced to, you will learn how to use Python to solve real challenges.\n\nWhat you will learn from this book\n- The various technologies and techniques that are available to Python developers\n- Ways to communicate with an SQL database\n- Tips for acting as a web server or communicating with one\n- How to access and manipulate XML files\n- Techniques for building a content management system\n- Ways to access and communicate with your operating system\n\nThis book is for developers who want to explore how to develop full-blown applications with Python. A general understanding of basic programming principles and object-oriented design is helpful.\n\nBook Details\nPaperback: 262 pages\nPublisher: Wrox (June 2008)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0470259329\nISBN-13: 978-0470259320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97fe849d64916c1540aacb5828c386e399394e58","amp;dn":"Python+Create+Modify+Reuse+V413HAV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97fe849d64916c1540aacb5828c386e399394e58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,254,132,157,100,145,108,21,64,170,203,88,40,195,134,227,153,57,78,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
