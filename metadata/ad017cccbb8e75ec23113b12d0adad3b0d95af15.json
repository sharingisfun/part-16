It has helped me to realize some important things in life and I feel I should share it with anyone who happens upon it. My apologies for the less than perfect quality of this torrent. I scanned it using my domestic printer/scanner combo. The resolution quality is good/okay but the pages aren't straight all the time. Hopefully the content will prove worthful and make up for the quality.\n\nLove and peace to you all!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad017cccbb8e75ec23113b12d0adad3b0d95af15","amp;dn":"The+Four+Noble+Truths+-+The+Dalai+Lama+%5B1997%5D.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad017cccbb8e75ec23113b12d0adad3b0d95af15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,1,124,204,187,142,117,236,35,17,59,18,208,173,173,59,13,149,175,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
