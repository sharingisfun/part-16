It defines, details, and contextualizes key terms and influences within Baudrillard's thought, including hyperreality, symbolic exchange, reversibility, simulation, disappearance, seduction, fashion, metaphysics, cloning, the Gulf War, terrorism, and 9/11. Entries are written by more than thirty Baudrillard specialists, including Rex Butler, Mike Gane, Gary Genosko, Victoria Grace, Diane Rubenstein, and Andrew Wernick. Drawing together the expertise of scholars from many countries and disciplines, this dictionary serves as an authoritative yet accessible introduction to the concepts, themes, and philosophical writings of Baudrillard.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc70137243f6a0bb91f6861a27c9f11c19cd688e","amp;dn":"The+Baudrillard+Dictionary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc70137243f6a0bb91f6861a27c9f11c19cd688e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,112,19,114,67,246,160,187,145,246,134,26,39,201,241,28,25,205,104,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
