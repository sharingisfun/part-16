Fields, in perhaps his most famous role, trades one-liners with the sultry Mae West in this timeless comedy.  The reputation of voluptuous\nFlowerbelle Lee (West) is tarnished when she is seen embracing a masked\nbandit in her bedroom.  Forced to leave town until she can return married and respectable, Flowerbelle boards a train where she meets the incorrigible\nGuthbert J. Twillie (Fields) and soon accepts his marriage proposal. The\nhilarious adventures continue as the newlyweds journey on to The Last Gasp\nSaloon in this rollicking romp.\n\nCast:\n\n Fay Adler         ...  Mrs. 'Pygmy' Allen \n Gene Austin       ...
