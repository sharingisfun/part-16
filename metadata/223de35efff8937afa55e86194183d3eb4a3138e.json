Philadelphia hosted 37 nations in five main buildings and 250 additional structures on 285 acres of land. The celebration looked backward to commemorate the progress made over the 100-year period, and it announced to the world that American invention and innovation was on a par with that of our foreign counterparts. Patriotism abounded, as did messages of industrial and commercial prowess that promised a brighter future for all. Over nine million people attended this awesome consumer spectacle, an event that set the tone for a long series of world's fairs yet to come.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:223de35efff8937afa55e86194183d3eb4a3138e","amp;dn":"Philadelphias+1876+Centennial+Exhibition+%28Images+of+America+-+Hi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"223de35efff8937afa55e86194183d3eb4a3138e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,61,227,94,255,248,147,122,250,85,232,97,148,24,61,62,180,163,19,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
