Meanwhile, after \nfinding herself in an unusual setting, \nMooney continues plotting to gain \npower, and Falcone attempts to change \nMaroni's plan for the Penguin. Then, \nBruce takes a treacherous hike. \n\n17/Slower+\nEvolve... or die.\n\nSd = 19/20, 720p = 18/19, so, 1080p = 17/18.\n\nWere a few requests for these, so we figured \nwhy not? We will only be doing a select few\nshows, and we will not do any from OTA/Cable/\netc, they just are not good enough for 1080 \nencodes. \nSize and audio may vary.\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54b7e427e2797bdfa0ef2593818db33722743620","amp;dn":"Gotham.S01E15.1080p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54b7e427e2797bdfa0ef2593818db33722743620","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,183,228,39,226,121,123,223,160,239,37,147,129,141,179,55,34,116,54,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
