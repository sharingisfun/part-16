The deaths were regrettable, but he had no choice. Duke Valens dragged his people into the war to save the life of one woman - a woman whose husband he then killed. He regrets the evil he's done, but he, equally, had no choice. Secretary Psellus never wanted to rule the Republic, or fight a desperate siege for its survival. As a man of considerable intelligence, he knows that he has a role to play - and little choice but to accept it. The machine has been built. All that remains is to set it in motion.\n\n\n\nShadow\n(The first book in the Scavenger series)\n(2001)\nA novel by K J Parker\n\n\nA man wakes in the wilderness, amid scattered corpses and inquisitive crows.
