But I did my best to search all the previous uploads and I didn't see this particular collection, or even any of these books. Apologies if they have been included in one of the 0-day or other large batch uploads. I don't spend nearly as much time picking all those apart as I used to (or as I should).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInvincible TPB Vol 01-16, Digital\n\nImage Comics, 2005-2012, 2482 total pages\n\nThese collections cover issues 1-90, all in beautiful digital glory. Every volume contains bonus material.\n\nWritten by Robert Kirkman\nIllustrated by Cory Walker, Ryan Ottley, Cliff Rathburn\nColored by Bill Crabtree, FCO Plascencia, Nikos Koutsis, John Rauch, Mike Toris\n\nInvincible (Mark Grayson) is a superhero in the Image Comics Universe. Created by writer Robert Kirkman and artist Cory Walker, the character first appeared in Tech Jacket #1 (October 2002), before graduating to his own self-titled regular series in 2003, as the premier title in Image's then-new superhero line.\n\nInvincible is the teenaged son of Omni-Man, an extraterrestrial superhero of the Viltrumite race. Invincible inherited his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s superhuman strength and ability to fly and he has sworn to protect the Earth. He has had trouble adjusting to his new-found powers and coping with the reality of his origins.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBefore somebody asks, yes, it's odd - I'm uploading a &quot;superhero&quot; book. Although the number is very small, I do read a few of them. I'm a big Robert Kirkman fan, though. When this series first started I gave it a try and ended up sticking with it. *shrug*\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3313ab81d7b3f7402762ee4b4328d55d04be4cc7","amp;dn":"Invincible+TPB+Vol+01-16+%28Digital%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3313ab81d7b3f7402762ee4b4328d55d04be4cc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,19,171,129,215,179,247,64,39,98,238,75,67,40,213,93,4,190,76,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
