Indeed, it is the only concept that can satisfactorily explain a phenomenon experienced by most students at some point in their work with the Course. This is the paradox of sincerely attempting to learn and live its principles under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, while experiencing the ongoing frustration of not doing just that.\n\nThis paradox is the topic explored in this book, which consists of an edited transcription of a talk given to a group of students by Kenneth Wapnick, supplemented with two articles, co-authored with his wife Gloria, that appeared in the Foundation's newsletter, &quot;The Lighthouse.&quot; The focus is on the many forms of resistance, and their basis in the fear of love. Freud's valuable insights are discussed, along with Jesus' role in helping us look without judgment at our investment in maintaining the ego's thought systemÃ¢â‚¬â€the miracle that resolves the paradox.\n\n&quot;We are ready to look more closely at the ego's thought system because together we have the lamp that will dispel it.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:216748bc1461a1dcd00a2a1f7ced7e71cf15655d","amp;dn":"Ending+Our+Resistance+to+Love+%2818%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"216748bc1461a1dcd00a2a1f7ced7e71cf15655d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,103,72,188,20,97,161,220,208,10,42,31,124,237,126,113,207,21,101,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
