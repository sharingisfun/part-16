What better way to learn it than by following along with artist/Manga Studio guru Doug Hills, as you create a comic page together. From sketching your initial concept to exporting and sharing your finished work with the world, this course goes through every step of the illustration process, explaining what tools will work best, and how to adapt them to your particular art style. Along the way, Doug shows how to import artwork, pencil in rough sketches, ink with the pen tools, add screen tones or color, and integrate word balloons and text. By the end of this course, you should not only feel comfortable with how Manga Studio works, but also have the beginnings of a comic page that you can continue on your own.\r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating a new comic page in Manga Studio\r\n\tâ€¢\tAdding and adjusting layers\r\n\tâ€¢\tPenciling roughs\r\n\tâ€¢\tUsing the Direct Draw tool\r\n\tâ€¢\tUsing rulers\r\n\tâ€¢\tInking pages\r\n\tâ€¢\tColoring pages\r\n\tâ€¢\tAdding effects\r\n\tâ€¢\tDrawing vector artwork\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating stories\r\n\tâ€¢\tCustomizing Manga Studio\r\n\r\n\r\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8f6f191e9a3e82fa639f2aa8703e6da1f50d4f4","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Manga+Studio+Essential+Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8f6f191e9a3e82fa639f2aa8703e6da1f50d4f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,246,241,145,233,163,232,47,166,57,242,170,135,3,230,218,31,80,212,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
