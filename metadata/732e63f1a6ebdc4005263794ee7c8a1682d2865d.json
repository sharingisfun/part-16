This recording is one I found originally torrented on Demonoid.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nQueen has their first number one hit.\n\nThe song ABC-TV used as the theme for the 1980 Winter Olympics is in the countdown.\n\nCasey answers a letter that reads, &quot;Dear Casey, I'd like to know how many song titles about writing letters have hit number one. The answer would be particularly interesting to people in my line of work. Signed: The Post-Master General of the United States.&quot;\n\nThere is a woman in the countdown whose male fans are so intense that to prove their adoration, one man swam a mile across the Mississippi and another destroyed his own car with a sledgehammer. Casey gives the details.\n\nA listener wants to know if any songs about sports teams or athletes have ever charted. Casey says there was one about a home-run champ, and another about a champion boxer.\n\nCasey tells how &quot;Hey Jude&quot; (the biggest hit The Beatles ever had) came to be written.\n\nLW#3: Coward Of The County - Kenny Rogers\nLW#2: Crazy Little Thing Called Love - Queen\nLW#1: Do That To Me One More Time - The Captain &amp; Tennille\n40: I Can't Help Myself - Bonnie Pointer\n39: Kiss Me In The Rain - Barbra Streisand\n38: Three Times In Love - Tommy James\n37: Off The Wall - Michael Jackson\n36: I Wanna Be Your Lover - Prince\n35: Let Me Go Love - Nicolette Larson\n34: DÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ  Vu - Dionne Warwick\n33: Don't Let Go - Isaac Hayes\nARCHIVES: Got To Give It Up - Marvin Gaye\n32: Special Lady - Ray, Goodman &amp; Brown\n31: Give It All You've Got - Chuck Mangione\n30: 99 - Toto\n29: Heartbreaker - Pat Benetar\n28: Escape (The Pina Colada Song) - Rupert Holmes\n27: The Long Run - The Eagles\n26: Don't Do Me Like That - Tom Petty &amp; The Heartbreakers\nLDD: I Feel Love - Donna Summer\n25: Wonderland - The Commodores\n24: Him - Rupert Holmes\n23: Refugee - Tom Petty &amp; The Heartbreakers\nARCHIVES: Gonna Fly Now - Bill Conti\n22: When I Wanted You - Barry Manilow\n21: Fool In The Rain - Led Zeppelin\n20: How Do I Make You - Linda Ronstadt\n19: Too Hot - Kool &amp; The Gang\n18: September Morn - Neil Diamond\n17: The Second Time Around - Shalimar\n16: This Is It - Kenny Loggins\n15: Another Brick In The Wall - Pink Floyd\n14: An American Dream - The Dirt Band\n13: Working My Way Back To You - The Spinners\n12: Daydream Believer - Anne Murray\n11: Romeo's Tune - Steve Forbert\nARCHIVES: Undercover Angel - Alan O'Day\n10: Sara - Fleetwood Mac\n9: Coward Of The County - Kenny Rogers\nExtra: Hey Jude - The Beatles\n8: Desire - Andy Gibb\n7:  On The Radio - Donna Summer\n6: Longer - Dan Fogelberg\n5: Rock With You - Michael Jackson\n4: Crusin' - Smokey Robinson\n3: Yes I'm Ready - Terry Deserio W/ KC\n2: Do That To Me One More Time - The Captain &amp; Tennille\n1: Crazy Little Thing Called Love - Queen","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:732e63f1a6ebdc4005263794ee7c8a1682d2865d","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1980+February_23rd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"732e63f1a6ebdc4005263794ee7c8a1682d2865d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,46,99,241,166,235,220,64,5,38,55,148,238,124,138,22,130,210,134,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
