The earliest CD's are mostly Jazz classics &amp; as the years went on he added more of his compositions. \n\nThis CD is a little different then most of his other works with added synthesizers for a modern touch, yet still holding on to his classic fast acoustic piano work. The drumming is more present with this CD, with a drummer &amp; a percussionist, while not over powering the other great musicians. This CD has a quintet of piano, synthesizer, bass, drummer &amp; percussionist, which is an interesting union. \n\nThis is modern Jazz that still holds onto the mainstream. Don't worry, this is not &quot;Modern&quot; as in weird or wild with artists Cecil Taylor or Sun Ra. Michel Petrucciani just added a little color during this outing.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nMichel Petrucciani - Playground\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Michel Petrucciani\nAlbum................: Playground\nGenre................: Jazz\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1991\n\nFLAC\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 58 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 262kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
