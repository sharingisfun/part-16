They have only the clothes on their backs and a cart filled with supplies from their homeland.\nThe townspeople work, build, get older, have children, and eventually die. Keeping them healthy, happy, and fed are essential to making a successful town grow. Any structure can be built at any time, provided that your people have collected the resources to do so.\nThere are many occupations that the people can perform from farming, hunting, and blacksmithing, to fishing, teaching, and healing. You can choose to replant forests, mine for iron, and quarry for rock, and more!\n\nBuild a city with any layout you want with almost no restriction on when, what, and where you build.\n\nKeep the population happy and healthy by providing them with food and warm shelter.\n\nWatch the town grow as you assign 20 different jobs to build buildings, grow food, craft tools and clothing, and more!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a88f6b1ef39f2d924fb007900feaa646e90d0492","amp;dn":"Banished+v1.0.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a88f6b1ef39f2d924fb007900feaa646e90d0492","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,143,107,30,243,159,45,146,79,176,7,144,15,234,166,70,233,13,4,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
