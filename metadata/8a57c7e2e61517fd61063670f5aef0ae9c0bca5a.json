The show was produced by 20th Century Fox Television and Chernin Entertainment. \n\nThe series focuses on a brother and sister who at first seem to be exact opposites: Ben is an over-the-top dreamer and professional underachiever, while younger sister Kate is a more practical single mother working as a bar manager. After visiting their home in Los Angeles, Ben realizes that his sister needs help with her life and taking care of her six-year-old daughter, Maddie. Because of this, he moves in with Kate so she can discover some of the things she has missed out on and Kate hopes to return the favor by bringing her brother back to reality. Along the way, they are surrounded by their close friends, B.J. and Tommy.\n\nCast: Dakota Johnson\n      Nat Faxon\n      Lucy Punch\n      Maggie Elizabeth Jones\n      Echo Kellum\n\n\nFile Types: Mkv\nVideo Codec: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC(part10)(avc1)\nLanguage: English\nResolution: 1280x720\nFrame Rate: 23.976215\nAudio Codec: A52 Audio  (aka AC3)(a52)\nChanels: 3F2R/LFE\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nBitrate: 384 kb/s\nTested with VLC on PC and WDTV Media Player on T.V.\n\n\nOfficial Website:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a57c7e2e61517fd61063670f5aef0ae9c0bca5a","amp;dn":"Ben+and+Kate+Season+1+Complete+720p+HD+%5BCARG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a57c7e2e61517fd61063670f5aef0ae9c0bca5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,87,199,226,230,21,23,253,97,6,54,112,245,174,240,174,156,11,202,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
