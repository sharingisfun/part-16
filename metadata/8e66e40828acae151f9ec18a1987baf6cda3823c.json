Struther's gorgeous vocals and clear eyed songwriting\nsensibilities give the band's new sound a neo-traditional edge recalling artists like Gillian Welch and Tim O'Brien. Coupled with the instrumental prowess and vocal harmonies of longtime members Angela Oudean (fiddle) and Jason Norris (mandolin), the new Bearfoot is reminiscent of Nickel Creek one moment and\nearly Dixie Chicks the next (both groups with whom they share the title of former Telluride Bluegrass Band Champions). \n\nStandout tracks on AMERICAN STORY include the catchy and inspiring 'Feel Free', the evocative 'The Dust' and the\ncajun-inspired 'Come Get Your Lonesome'. With a sound that is at once collaborative, uplifting, energetic, haunting, beautiful\nand inspired, Bearfoot is a band in its prime, on top of a cultural mountain where they honor the past and present of American string band music, all while shaping its future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e66e40828acae151f9ec18a1987baf6cda3823c","amp;dn":"Bearfoot+-+American+Story+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e66e40828acae151f9ec18a1987baf6cda3823c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,102,228,8,40,172,174,21,31,158,193,138,25,135,186,246,205,163,130,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
