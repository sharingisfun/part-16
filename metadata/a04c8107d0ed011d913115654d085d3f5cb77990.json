It was control of the sea rather than her land empire that was the key to Britain's growing wealth.\n\nTechnological advances saw Britain and France engage in an arms race over battleships. While Britain's navy appeared to be winning, the meritocracy fostered in Nelson's time was slowly being eroded by an entrenched hierarchy which smothered any spark of initiative among its sailors.\n\nWhen Germany emerged as a new threat, modernising admiral Jackie Fisher was called to reform the Navy. Fisher believed in peace through deterrence and had plans for a huge new battleship - the Dreadnought.\n\nWhen war finally came, the British and German fleets clashed off Jutland in 1916. But the outcome was not the knock-out blow the British public wanted. Britain emerged from World War I victorious but broke, and no longer able to maintain by far the world's largest fleet. In time, other nations eclipsed her. It was the end of centuries of naval supremacy.\n\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.0\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 59 minutes\nNumber Of Parts: 4\nPart Size: 1.70GB\nSubtitles: merged\nRipped by: JungleBoy\nSource: DVB-S\n\nforums[dot]mvgroup[dot]org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a04c8107d0ed011d913115654d085d3f5cb77990","amp;dn":"BBC+Empire+of+the+Seas+4of4+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a04c8107d0ed011d913115654d085d3f5cb77990","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,76,129,7,208,237,1,29,145,49,21,101,77,8,93,63,92,183,121,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
