In many ways, the double album was a recap of all the styles and sounds that made John a star. Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is all over the map, beginning with the prog rock epic &quot;Funeral for a Friend (Love Lies Bleeding)&quot; and immediately careening into the balladry of &quot;Candle in the Wind.&quot; For the rest of the album, John leaps between popcraft (&quot;Bennie and the Jets&quot;), ballads (&quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot;), hard rock (&quot;Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting&quot;), novelties (&quot;Jamaica Jerk-Off&quot;), Bernie Taupin's literary pretensions (&quot;The Ballad of Danny Bailey&quot;), and everything in between. Though its diversity is impressive, the album doesn't hold together very well. Even so, its individual moments are spectacular and the glitzy, crowd-pleasing showmanship that fuels the album pretty much defines what made Elton John a superstar in the early '70s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71e07c88637facfc770abf02441fd84ae5b2801d","amp;dn":"Elton+John+-+Goodbye+Yellow+Brick+Road+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71e07c88637facfc770abf02441fd84ae5b2801d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,224,124,136,99,127,172,252,119,10,191,2,68,31,216,74,229,178,128,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
