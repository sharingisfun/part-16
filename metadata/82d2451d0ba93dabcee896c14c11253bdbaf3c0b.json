The series is composed of books written by either one or two authors or edited volumes with a number of contributors. Authorities from industry, academia, and the government participate in writing these books.\r\nThe aim of the series is to cover the many facets of cosmetic science and technology. Topics are drawn from a wide spectrum of disciplines ranging from chemistry, physics, biochemistry and dermatology to consumer evaluations, safety issues, efficacy, toxicity and regulatory questions. Organic, inorganic, physical, analytical and polymer chemistry, microbiology, emulsion and lipid technology all play important roles in cosmetic science","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82d2451d0ba93dabcee896c14c11253bdbaf3c0b","amp;dn":"Cosmetic+Science+and+Technology+%5BUpdated+at+2016.01.02%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82d2451d0ba93dabcee896c14c11253bdbaf3c0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,210,69,29,11,169,61,171,206,232,150,193,76,17,37,59,219,175,60,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
