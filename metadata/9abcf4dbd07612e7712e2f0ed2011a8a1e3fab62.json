Recorded within the three weeks during the hiatus of former group Destiny's Child and upon the success of worldwide number-one hit single &quot;Dilemma,&quot; a collaboration with rapper Nelly, the album facilitated Rowland in becoming a viable solo star. Simply Deep peaked at number twelve on the Billboard 200 in the U.S., where it was certified gold by the RIAA for more than 600,000 copies sold. The album also topped the UK Albums Chart and became a gold-seller in Ireland, Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and other countries, resulting into a worldwide sales total of 2.5 million copies.\n\nAmazon.com Review By Kim Hughes - It's hard to say what adds more ballast to singer Kelly Rowland's solo debut, Simply Deep--her chart-topping past with Destiny's Child or her insanely sexy duet (and accompanying video) with hip-hop star Nelly on the song &quot;Dilemma.&quot; For certain, Rowland will take her place alongside fellow Destiny's Child member Beyonce Knowles as a hip, self-assured R&amp;B force with a terrifically elastic voice, if not groundbreaking material. A slick, mostly upbeat clutch of smoochy urban ballads and he-done-me-wrong laments, Simply Deep sounds expensive and Cristal-soaked, which was doubtless the goal. And there are notable exceptions--&quot;Love/Hate&quot; is a electronically juiced rump-shaker while the poignant album opener, &quot;Stole,&quot; stands as a beacon to the underdog, delivered in a voice as striking as the face it belongs to, which is saying something.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Stole\n[02] Dilemma \tNelly Featuring Kelly Rowland\n[03] Haven't Told You\n[04] Can't Nobody\n[05] Love / Hate\n[06] Simply Deep\tFeaturing Solange Knowles\n[07] (Love Lives In) Strange Places\n[08] Obsession\n[09] Heaven\n[10] Past 12\n[11] Everytime You Walk Out That Door\n[12] Train On A Track\n[13] Beyond Imagination\n[14] Make U Wanna Stay \tFeaturing Joe Budden [Bonus Track]\n[15] No Coincidence\t[Bonus Track - Album Version]\n \nMusic Video \n\n[01]  [2002] Kelly Rowland - Stole\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 00h:56m:53s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 167mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v7.6.2.9 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; Mpeg \nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop\nRelease Date\t&gt; 28 October 2002\nRecord Company\t&gt; Columbia Sony Music\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt; http://www.kellyrowland.com\n&gt;\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Rowland \n&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/r/rowland.html \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/kellyrowland \n&gt;\n&gt;[Dilemma]\n\n\n[flash width=500 height=500 background=#000000\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9abcf4dbd07612e7712e2f0ed2011a8a1e3fab62","amp;dn":"%5B2002%5D+Simply+Deep+-+Kelly+Rowland+167mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9abcf4dbd07612e7712e2f0ed2011a8a1e3fab62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,188,244,219,208,118,18,231,113,46,47,14,210,1,26,138,30,63,171,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
