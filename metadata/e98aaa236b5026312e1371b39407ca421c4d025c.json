I can't power on my Dell by using only the battery. If you find the solution (or problem), please comment. \n\nPD: Pressing the power button by 30 seconds doesn't work. The AC adpater works fine. I suspect maybe the AO4407A IC are the ones that should be replaced.\n\nThanks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e98aaa236b5026312e1371b39407ca421c4d025c","amp;dn":"Schematics+for+the+N5110+motherboard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e98aaa236b5026312e1371b39407ca421c4d025c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,138,170,35,107,80,38,49,46,19,113,179,148,7,202,66,28,77,2,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
