It dates its origins to 1970, when Benny Binion invited seven of the best-known poker players to the Horseshoe Casino for a single tournament, with a set start and stop time, and a winner determined by secret ballot.\n\nThe winner of each event receives a World Series of Poker bracelet and a monetary prize based on the number of entrants and buy-in amounts. Over the years, the tournament has grown in both the number of events and in the number of participants. Each year, the WSOP culminates with the $10,000 no-limit hold'em &quot;Main Event,&quot; which, since 2004, has attracted entrants numbering in the thousands. The victor receives a multi-million dollar cash prize and a bracelet, which has become the most coveted award a poker player can win. The winner of the World Series of Poker Main Event is considered to be the World Champion of Poker.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a57072c8623364a8f46ad869d4fa8096f9983bf","amp;dn":"World.Series.Of.Poker.2012.Final.Table.Part3.WEB-TPB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a57072c8623364a8f46ad869d4fa8096f9983bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,87,7,44,134,35,54,74,143,70,173,134,157,79,168,9,111,153,131,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
