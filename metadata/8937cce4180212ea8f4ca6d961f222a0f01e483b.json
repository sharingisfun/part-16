Hykes and his group have constructed amazing pieces of music based on the natural overtone sound of the human voice and by necessity, in order to hear the overtones, they sing very long vowel sounds, controlling the harmonics by mouth shape, tongue position, diaphragm control, etc. This CD was recorded in a cathedral which amplifies the overtones and doubles the sound of each voice. The effect--particularly on the track &quot;Arc Descents&quot;--is hair-raising and wonderful. I still can&amp;#039;t figure out how their voices are able to descend in sliding tones for a full five minutes!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8937cce4180212ea8f4ca6d961f222a0f01e483b","amp;dn":"David+Hykes+and+the+Harmonic+Choir+-+Hearing+Solar+Winds","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8937cce4180212ea8f4ca6d961f222a0f01e483b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,55,204,228,24,2,18,234,143,76,166,217,97,242,34,160,240,30,72,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
