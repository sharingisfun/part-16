Their style has changed over the years. Originally being an old-school black metal/viking metal act, they now perform a slightly more experimental and progressive form of black metal which has elements of 1970Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s progressive rock. The name was inspired by an Immortal demo track, Enslaved in Rot.\n\nEnslaved was formed in 1991, by Ivar BjÃƒÂ¸rnson and Grutle Kjellson. Joined by drummer Trym Torsson, they did their first demo in the summer of 1992. While working with the first full length, there came a call from England, resulting in the two 1993 legendary mini albums; Hordanes Land and Emperor These two mini-albums was released as a split-record Ã¢â‚¬Å“Emperor/Hordanes LandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Due to tragic circumstances, EnslavedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album Vikingligr Veldi was held back until the spring of 1994. Enslaved moved their label base to French Osmose Productions, and Frost were released late in the 1994. Enslaved were now known outside the Black / Extreme circles of Northern Europe. This led to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Winter War Europe Tour Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ95Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½, and the first Norwegian Black / Extreme tour ever in the US, Canada and Mexico during Ã¢â‚¬â„¢95. The tours were a great success; but Trym Torson moved on to join Emperor as a drummer.\n\nEld was recorded with drummer Harald Helgeson in 1996, and released the year after. However, working with Harald was no permanent solution, so Dirge Rep (then Gehenna) and R. Kronheim were hired, becoming integral parts during the recording of Blodhemn (Ã¢â‚¬â„¢98).\n\nEnslaved released an important milestone in 2000 with Mardraum: Beyond the Within, which marked a turning point for the band; and sent shock waves through the Extreme Metal scene with a revolutionary experimental and innovative approach to their genre. The band kept adding fuel to the fire, and released Monumension in 2001, and again the band was shocked to see the positive response to their Ã¢â‚¬Å“no rulesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ approach to Extreme Metal. Gigs were still being played in Norway, Europe and the States, in front of a faithful and ever increasing audience.\n\nAfter returning from the UK in March 2002, R. Kronheim had to leave the band. The band kept on working with new material, in which they now saw a synthesis between the original thesis (the Ã¢â‚¬Å“BlackerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Enslaved) and the anti-thesis forming from Mardraum onwards (the experimental, progressive and gloomier Enslaved) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Below the Lights was recorded in 2002 and released the year after, and presented the perfect blend of power, tradition, progressive elements and dark psychedelia. The process and hard work had taken its toll on drummer Dirge, and he left the band.\n\nA new line-up were put together during and after the recording of Below the Lights, including old-timer Cato Bekkevold (Red Harvest founder), Arve Isdal (aka. Ice Dale) and Herbrand Larsen. With all the changes left behind, Enslaved reached new heights with their live performance, also adding strong visual elements in the shape of video art and more. English market leader Kerrang! rewarded their Inferno 2004 performance with a full house: 5 K!Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s.\n\nThe new line-up recorded Isa during the autumn of 2004, and was released in Oct/Nov Ã¢â‚¬â„¢04 (Feb Ã¢â‚¬â„¢05 in the US). The album received raving reviews in all territories (except Finland obviously), and put Enslaved at the very forefront of contemporary Extreme Metal. A European Tour with fellow Norsemen Vreid took place in February and March 2005. The tour was rewarded with both great reviews and great turnouts. In absentia, during the tour, Enslaved also received both the Norwegian Grammy and the independent Alarm Price for Isa.\n\nThe band released the full length album Ruun in 2006, which received great critics world wide and Enslaved received the Norwegian Grammy (Metal) for the second time in a row. Ruun is an extreme progressive metal record with growl-vocals and quite different from the bands first records.\n\nEnslaved released the album Vertebrae in 2008, which gained wide critical acclaim, including Terrorizer MagazineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s album of the year and criticÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s choice album of the year award for 2008. Many of their techniques on the album, particularly harmonies, have been compared to Pink Floyd\n\nAlthough the band now records in English, their early songs were mostly recorded in Icelandic or Old Norse, with one track on their first full-length album being performed in ancient Norwegian. Lyrics from Frost to Mardraum were mainly in their native Norwegian. Most of their lyrics relate to Norse mythology or history.\n\nShining:\n\nQuote:\nShining is a Swedish black metal band formed in 1996 by Niklas Kvarforth in Halmstad, Sweden. The bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music contains depressive undertones, which include personal and suicide-themed lyrics. Kvarforth is the main composer and vocalist of the band. He was only twelve years old when he started Shining. By the time Kvarforth was fourteen, Shining had released their first EP, Submit to Selfdestruction (1998), on which he played guitars and bass. It was not until the band released their first album, Within Deep Dark Chambers (2000), that Kvarforth became the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocalist. The bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name does not refer to the book The Shining or the film based on it, but rather according to Kvarforth, it means Ã¢â‚¬Å“the path to enlightenment.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nShining openly promotes suicide and self-harm in all its forms (e.g. drugs) in their lyrics. Kvarforth has claimed, with contentment, there have been some cases of people committing suicide at least partially under the influence of ShiningÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music. Musically, Shining went from black metal with doom influences on their earlier work to a more progressive extreme metal sound with extensive use of clean guitars, guitar solos, different vocal styles and often tempo shifts and odd time signatures.\n\nIn the past, Kvarforth said that he wanted to force feed his listeners with self-destructive and suicidal imagery and lyrics. In the beginning he used the term Ã¢â‚¬Å“suicidal black metalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for his music to separate himself from other groups. However, he stopped using the term in 2001 because it had begun to be used by a slew of other bands, whom he felt had misinterpreted his vision and were using the music as a kind of therapy rather than a weapon against the listener as Kvarforth intended. He later said that he wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t call Shining a black metal band and called the Ã¢â‚¬Å“suicidal black metalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ term a foolish idea.\n\nThe band split-up in August 2004 and their fourth album, IV: The Eerie Cold, was supposed to be their last, but the band reformed later the same year with a new line-up capable of live shows. Kvarforth disappeared in July 2006 and a rumor was spread he was presumed to have committed suicide. On August 23, 2006 the band posted a statement on their website declaring Kvarforth had disappeared. The band was said to continue with a new singer named Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ghoul,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as one of the wishes from Kvarforth.\n\nAt a concert that took place on February 3, 2007 at Diezel in Halmstad, Sweden, Ã¢â‚¬Å“GhoulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was revealed to be Kvarforth. The concert was violent in nature, sparking controversy in the Swedish media, with Kvarforth occasionally fighting the audience and the guest vocalists (Attila Csihar, Maniac and Nattefrost).\n\nRazorblades were handed to a member of the audience, and one person was kicked in the chest after grabbing KvarforthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s genitals; who was later found to be Maniac posing as a crazed fan. One member of the audience recalls the kicking: Ã¢â‚¬Å“A couple of songs are finished and Kvarforth is standing with zipped up leather pants and some drunk Swede touches his crotch. Kvarforth looks shocked and shouts Ã¢â‚¬ËœDonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t touch me,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ before he kicks the fan in the chest.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe band released their fifth album in 2007, which was at first going to be called V: Besvikelsens Dystra Monotoni but was later changed to V: Halmstad, a reference to KvarforthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hometown.\n\nThat was followed by four more albums, the latest being Redefining Darkness (2012), and 8Ã‚Â½ - FeberdrÃƒÂ¶mmar I Vaket TillstÃƒÂ¥nd (2013). A tenth album is expected in Spring 2015.\n\nBandmembers:\n\nEnslaved:\n\nCato Bekkevold - Drums, Percussion\nIvar BjÃƒÂ¸rnson - Keyboards, Vocals, Guitars\nHerbrand Larsen - Keyboards, Mellotron, Vocals, Guitars\nGrutle Kjellson - Vocals, Bass\nArve Isdal - Guitars\n\nShining:\n\nNiklas Kvarforth - Vocals, Guitars, Keyboards\nPeter Huss - Guitars\nChristian Larsson - Bass\nRainer Tuomikanto - Drums\nEuge Valovirta - Guitars, Vocals\n\n\nQuote:\nThis is a split EP between Enslaved and Shining released on February 24th, 2015 through Devil Inc.
