Ever-changing in both style and sound, Peter Bonne broke off from the Autumn project and briefly formed Linear Movement as an outlet for his newest material. These tracks are more song-oriented than the soundtrack-esque and experimental sound of Autumn's early material, but are equally well-crafted. The record features both male and female vocals and contributions by Peter Koutstaal and Lieve Van Steerteghem.\n\nThis is the lone Linear Movement release, for the project spanned but two years before Peter re-joined with Geert Coppens to form Twilight Ritual. It was originally released on cassette in 1983 and re-released on CD through Micrart.com.\n\nWithout any further ado, here's the details:\n\n\n\nLinear Movement- Pulse Music LP\n1.
