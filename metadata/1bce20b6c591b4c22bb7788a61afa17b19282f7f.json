Having made his debut on Capricorn Records in 1993, Chesney has recorded thirteen albums, eleven of which have been certified gold or higher by the RIAA.\n\nTo date, he has also produced more than thirty Top Ten singles on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, thirteen of which reached Number One. In addition, Chesney has received six ACM (including four consecutive Entertainer of the Year Awards),[2] as well as three CMA awards. Chesney is also one of the most popular touring acts in country music, regularly selling out the venues at which he performs;[3][4] his 2007 Flip-Flop Summer Tour was the highest-grossing country road trip of 2007.[5] He was awarded his 4th consecutive ACM Entertainer of the Year award on May 18, 2008.&quot;\n\n2007  Just Who I Am: Poets &amp; Pirates is the eleventh studio album by country music artist Kenny Chesney. It was released in the United States on September 11, 2007. The CD was leaked on the Internet on September 5, 2007, almost a week before its release.\n\nThe album debuted at #3 on the Billboard 200 chart.
