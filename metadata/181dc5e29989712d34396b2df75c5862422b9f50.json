Users gain the experience of a new era of animation with an opportunity to create natural motion paths on-the-fly, optionally with the use of an input device, gaining instant gratification through highly realistic interactive real-time animation.\n\nKey Benefits:\n\nVisual for film and Broadcast - Craft Director Studio provide realistic and accurate vehicle incident and traffic animation, collision visualizations and scene fly-throughs in less time than it takes them to write teleprompter text, allowing more\ntime for creativity.\n\nPrevisualization - Craft Director Studio are interactive, providing better real-time control for precise movements exactly as envisioned by a producer or director.\n\nGame Development ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Craft Director Studio allow game developers to enhance in-game cinematics through a modular, configurable system that replicates a specific rig within the host application. Artists may actually ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdriveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a vehicle within the creative environment, achieving a more realistic product in less time.\n\nArchitectural Visualization ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Film walk throughs of architectural designs are easily achieved through Craft Director\nStudioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unique camera angles and views. Cameras quickly and easily navigate exterior to interior layouts of a scene in realtime, saving the time and cost of an outside animation contractor.\n\nAccident Reconstruction and Forensics ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Combined with user research and data, Craft Director Studio can provide nearinstant visualizations and simulations of any vehicle accident scene, simulating and recording key-frames in real-time.\nExtremely fast animation simulation software.\nWork directly in 3ds Max, Cinema 4D, or Maya.\nSave time through automatic keyframing.\nIncrease quality through the use of real-time physics.\n\nCraft Director Studio works in most versions of 3ds max, Cinema 4d, Maya, Softimage, Windows and OS X. Please go to the System Requirements to see if your system is able to run on the system you are using.\n\nAdd-ons\n\nThere is a bunch of add-ons that can be added to Craft Director Studio. In fact there are allredy a bunch of basic tools included for free. By combining these tools you can create new tools. As an example you can create a dumper tryck with the help of combining 4-Wheeler Free and 1Drotator.\n\nNew!\nCraft Director StudioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ v10.1\n\nWith support for the new versions of Autodesk's 3ds Max 2011, Maya 2011 and Softimage 2011.\nAnimate with ease!\n\nBased on cutting-edge research in and autonomous control systems, Craft Director Studio extends creative possibilities by eliminating the time-consuming tasks of keyframing, scripting and rigging.\n\n\nEnjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:181dc5e29989712d34396b2df75c5862422b9f50","amp;dn":"CRAFT_DIRECTOR_STUDIO_V10.1.2_WIN32_WIN64_READ_NFO-XFORCE%28Murlok","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"181dc5e29989712d34396b2df75c5862422b9f50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,29,197,226,153,137,113,45,52,57,107,45,247,92,88,98,66,43,159,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
