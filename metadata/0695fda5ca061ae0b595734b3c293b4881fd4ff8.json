The Anti-Villain League (AVL) become suspicious about this case as the lab contains a mutating chemical compound, PX-41, which could transform living things into indestructible killing machines. The organization must find someone to stop the mutating chemical from getting into the wrong hands.\n\nTo that end, Lucy Wilde, an AVL agent forcibly abducts Gru after stunning him unconscious with her lipstick taser. Two of Gru's minions who try to thwart her plans are captured also. They travel to AVL's underwater headquarters where Gru meets the league's Director, Silas Ramsbottom. He asks Gru to assist them in their efforts to track down the perpetrator and the missing mutagen. Gru refuses, preferring to concentrate on his new venture of producing bottled jellies and the responsibilities of being a father to his three adopted girls, Margo, Agnes and Edith. Before he leaves, Lucy admits she was impressed by his work as a villain and gives her namecard to Gru, urging him to contact her if he changes his mind. Upon return to his lab, Gru realises that his minion-run production line had churned out bottles of awful-tasting jellies. Also, his research scientist, Dr. Nefario confesses to Gru that he misses being &quot;evil&quot; and has been offered employment elsewhere. After giving Dr. Nefario a 21 fart-gun send-off with the minions, Gru contacts Lucy and takes on the task of recovering the stolen mutagen.\n\nTraces of chemical scent given off by the mutagen narrow the search to the confines of The Paradise Shopping Mall. Gru works undercover as the owner of a cupcake shop in that mall with Lucy being assigned as his partner. He suspects one of the owners of a restaurant, named Eduardo, in the mall is an old super-villain called El Macho, who supposedly died after body-strapping TNT and riding a shark into an active volcano that resulted in his fiery demise. Lucy and Gru then decide to break into his restaurant but are spotted by Eduardo's pet chicken and narrowly escape from being caught by Eduardo when he returns back to his shop late in the night. However, they find only a jar of secret-recipe salsa in his safe and nothing relevant to link Eduardo to the crime. While the team investigates wig merchant Floyd Eagle-san, Margo begins to develop a crush on Eduardo's son, Antonio, to Gru's frustration. The whole family is invited to Eduardo's Cinco de Mayo party at his mansion where Gru's protectiveness of his daughter leads him to make baseless wild accusations to the AVL's Silas about Eduardo as El Macho and his son, which are scoffed at.\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0695fda5ca061ae0b595734b3c293b4881fd4ff8","amp;dn":"Despicable+Me+2+TS+FLV.flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0695fda5ca061ae0b595734b3c293b4881fd4ff8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,149,253,165,202,6,26,224,181,149,115,75,60,41,59,72,129,253,79,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
