The main track of the album was one of the greatests\nclassics of that period: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Pacific 202ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, a mixture of acid basslines, a saxophone sequence and atmospheric synths in\na clear jazzy climax.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Magical DreamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ represented a lovely combination of melodic bass &amp; synths with breakbeat and the nice vocals of\nVanessa. In ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“AncodiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, some scratch effects were used in the melodic breakbeat base, joining the elements of hip hop,\ndub, house with new melodies. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Donkey DoktorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ borrowed the sample of the Detroit classic track, CybotronÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Techno CityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\nand added it with a melodic and futuristic breakbeat structure. 'Ancodia', had vocal chorus samples and scratching,\nwith clear hip hop influences; 'Cobra Bora' was a litle bit faster kind of breakbeat, more dancefloor, with a drop out full\nof climax &amp; melodies, but ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“SunriseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ had a different approach in a strange, ethereal and sinister kind of music.\n\n\n\n\nAlbum Reviews (c/o www.discog.com)\n\nHands down - one if the most important electronic/early techno recordings, ever.\nRecorded in Manchester '89 during the 24 Hour Party People days on Trevor Horn's forward-thinking\nlabel ZTT. We've got a very credible vibe in these tunes and this helped to raise the bar on overall sound\nand production (i.e Future Sound of London or Renegade Soundwave)-at the same time there's some\nsublte wacky stuff on here. &quot;Pacific 202&quot; is a masterpiece and is a major timeline marker. Check it!\n\nhis LP has some of the most complex and beautiful drum programming you are likely to ever hear.\nMakes you wonder what happened to not just these guys but to the scene as a whole. After a masterpiece like\nthis which is truly blueprint for that big sound that everybody attempted to immitate. Check out 'Cobra Bora'.\nJust when you think it has done it's thing, it takes off to another level. Pure techno jazz of the very highest order.\nAn absolute masterpiece from start to finish. This is more apparent now than ever before and although to the\nuntrained ear (or novice) this may sound dated, its only because of those big stadium sounds\n(as used on ie. Cubik) that will make people think this. Unaware to them, It was these guys and more to the point,\nthis LP that came above all, first in line with that sound. Think again. This is a classic of monumental proportion\nand defines that year not just by title alone but to hear it, is to go back to the finest techno music of that that year,\n90. Ahh, the memories.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n808 State - Ninety\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nArtist.................................: 808 State\nAlbum.....................................: Ninety\nGenre.................................: Electronic\nSource........................................: CD\nYear........................................: 1989\n\nRipper: Exact Audio Copy (Secure mode) &amp; SONY DVD RW AW-G170A\n\nCodec...........: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion.........: reference libFLAC 1.1.3 20061120\nQuality....: Lossless, (bitrates: 919 - 1053 kbps)\nChannels..............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags..........................: ID3 v1.0, ID3 v2.3\n\nInformation.: Original 1989 European pressing (Cat: 246 461-2)\n\nRipped by.............: BSW on 5/19/2007\nPosted by..............: BSW on 7/1/2011\nNews Server..........: news.astraweb.com\n\nNews Group(s).: alt.binaries.sounds.mp3.metal.full.albums\n\nIncluded....: NFO, SFV, M3U, LOG, CUE\nCovers................: Front Back CD\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n1.
