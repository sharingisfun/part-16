In danger of losing his ninth and final life, Ambrose makes a desperate plea to the universe. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll do anythingÃ¢â‚¬â€anything!Ã¢â‚¬â€if he can just survive and enjoy a nice long, final life. His prayer is answered when a stranger comes along and saves himÃ¢â‚¬â€and now it looks like he has to hold up his end of the bargain.\n\nThe stranger turns out to be a firefighter named Zach, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in need of some serious romantic help. If Ambrose can just bring Zach together with Merilee, the nice lady who works at Pet Palace, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bound to earn him a healthy ninth life. Unfortunately for Ambrose, his mission is a lot harder than he ever thought. Merriliee is way too shy to make the first move on a ladies man like Zach, and Zach thinks heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all wrong for a nice girl like Merrilee. Now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to take all of AmbroseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s feline wilesÃ¢â‚¬â€and maybe even a good old fashioned Christmas miracleÃ¢â‚¬â€to make them both realize that what theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking for is right in front of their eyes.\n\nReview\n&quot;...witty characterizations, slapstick mishaps, and plenty of holiday cheer.&quot;\n--Publishers Weekly\n\n&quot;...the perfect gift for the cat lover in your life.&quot;\n--Five Alarm Book Reviews\n\n&quot;If you love Christmas, cats and happy endings, Sheila RobertsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ The Nine Lives of Christmas is the ticket to great holiday reading pleasure!&quot;\n--Literarily Speaking\nAbout the Author\nSheila Roberts is the author of On Strike for Christmas, Small Change, The Snow Globe, Bikini Season, and other bestselling books.
