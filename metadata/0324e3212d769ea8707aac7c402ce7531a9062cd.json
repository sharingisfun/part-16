Richard Gere delivers a soul-baring performance as George, a man whose struggle to find food and a place to sleep in New York City is beautifully captured with remarkable realism and heartrending compassion. Shuffled into the unforgiving bureaucracy of a menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shelter, George seems destined to wind up as just another lost soul swallowed up by the systemÃ¢â‚¬â€until he meets a gregarious, down-and-out ex-jazzman (played by Broadway legend Ben Vereen) who inspires George to reconnect with his estranged daughter (Jena Malone). Cinematically stunning and shot in an eloquently observational style, Time Out of Mind is an unforgettable plunge into a world that is all too easily overlooked.\n\nDirector: Oren Moverman\n\nWriters: Oren Moverman\n\nActors: Richard Gere, Ben Vereen, Jena Malone, Kyra Sedgwick, Jeremy Strong\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nRun Time: 2 hours 1 minute","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0324e3212d769ea8707aac7c402ce7531a9062cd","amp;dn":"Time+Out+of+Mind.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%231+%5BHD%5D+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0324e3212d769ea8707aac7c402ce7531a9062cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,36,227,33,45,118,158,168,112,122,172,124,64,44,231,83,26,144,98,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
