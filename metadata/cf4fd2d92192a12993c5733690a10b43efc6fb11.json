In many ways these are mutually compatible, for where health and safety is jeopardized, the discomfort results. Most work-related injuries can be viewed as biochemical damage to a tissue or organ; ultimately all injuries are sustained by tissues. \n\nWritten by leaders in the field, this text deals systematically with the biomechanics of tissues and organs in the workplace. The book establishes a foundation for the understanding of gross biomechanical loads on the human system at tissue level. It also provides details of the biomechanics of organs, themselves a composite of different tissues, and the differential effect and vulnerability of structures of the organ. Finally, the whole body system is dealt with in a biomechanical context. This text is a thorough description and discussion of common or work-related injuries, their mechanisms and the theories behind them. Chapters provide ergonomic relevance, ergonomic scenarios, and practical ergonomic advice on appropriate interventions.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf4fd2d92192a12993c5733690a10b43efc6fb11","amp;dn":"Biomechanics+in+Ergonomics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf4fd2d92192a12993c5733690a10b43efc6fb11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,79,210,217,33,146,161,41,147,197,115,54,144,161,11,67,239,198,251,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
