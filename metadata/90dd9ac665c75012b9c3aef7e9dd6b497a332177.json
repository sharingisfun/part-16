Nevertheless, Shines's electric playing was always greatly informed by the Delta style, and, in the '60s and '70s, he began to revisit his roots in a solo acoustic format. TRADITIONAL DELTA BLUES captures Shines in this context, and features 14 excellent performances that display his passionate singing, fine bottleneck playing, and intricate phrasing in the Johnson tradition.\nNot surprisingly, Shines covers several Johnson songs, including &quot;Terraplane Blues&quot; (here titled &quot;Dynaflow Blues&quot;), &quot;Milkcow's Calf Blues&quot; (titled &quot;Milk Cow Blues&quot;), and &quot;Tell Me Mama,&quot; a song Shines reportedly learned from Johnson, though Johnson never recorded it. Shines also contributes several fine originals to the set, the driving &quot;Delta Pine,&quot; and the rhythmically slashing &quot;Arguing and Boodling,&quot; among them. A handful of blues classics (&quot;Sitting on Top of the World,&quot; for example) round out this outstanding latter-day set of truly authentic Delta blues. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90dd9ac665c75012b9c3aef7e9dd6b497a332177","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Johnny+Shines+-+Traditional+Delta+Blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90dd9ac665c75012b9c3aef7e9dd6b497a332177","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,221,154,198,101,199,80,18,185,195,174,247,233,221,107,73,122,51,33,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
