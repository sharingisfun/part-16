The School ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ held at the Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Singapore from 20 April to 2 May 2009 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ on which this volume is based on was sponsored by ICSU and by its members from IUTAM (the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics) and IUGG (the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics).\n\nThis volume provides an indepth graduate-level introduction to the fluid dynamics and geophysics of hazards such as tropical cyclones, flooding, atmospheric pollution and tsunamis. It also includes discussion of the possible effects of climate change on these phenomena. Indeed, the current importance of this area is of great public concern.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:589523f22a061656c55ebf2d75303748398ab47f","amp;dn":"Environmental+Hazards+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"589523f22a061656c55ebf2d75303748398ab47f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,149,35,242,42,6,22,86,197,94,191,45,117,48,55,72,57,138,180,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
