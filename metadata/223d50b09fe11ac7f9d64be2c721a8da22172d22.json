It has formed the basis of the Showtime television series Dexter. It won the 2005 Dilys Award.\nThe novelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s protagonist, Dexter Morgan, works for the Miami Metro Police Department (a fictional version of the Miami-Dade Police Department.\n\nDARKLY DREAMING DEXTER\n\n   1. ISBN-10: 0307277887\n   2. ISBN-13: 978-0307277886\n\nMeet Dexter Morgan, a polite wolf in sheepÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s clothingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ a monster who cringes at the sight of bloodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ a serial killer whose one golden rule makes him immensely likable: HE ONLY KILLS BAD PEOPLE.\n\nDexter Morgan isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t exactly the kind of man youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d bring home to Mom. Though heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s playful and has a wonderfully ironic sense of humor, DexterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s one character flaw (his proclivity for murder) can be off-putting. But at heart Dexter is the perfect gentleman, supportive of his sister, Deb, a Miami cop, and interested only in doing away with people who really deserve his special visit. Dex is quite good-looking but totally indifferent to (and, frankly, a bit puzzled by) the attention paid to him by women. Despite the fact that he cantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ stand the sight of blood, he works as a blood-splatter analyst for the Mmiami police department, a job that allows him to keep tabs on the latest crimes and keep an eye open for his next quarry.\n\nDexterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s well-organized life is suddenly disrupted when a second, much more visible serial killer appears in Miami. Dex is intrigued, even delighted, by the fact that the other killer appears to have a style reminiscent of his own. Yet he canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t help but feel that the mysterious new arrival is not merely invading his turf but reaching out to him as well. This new killer seems to be doing more tha copying DexterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½he seems to be saying, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCome out and play.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ DexterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s secret life makes for a lonely existenceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ even a lovable monster can be intrigued by the prospect of finding a friend.\n\nIntroducing one of the most witty and orginial narrators in years, Jeff LindsayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Darkly Dreaming Dexter is a fresh, surprising, and brilliantly executed novel.\n\nDEARLY DEVOTED DEXTER\n\n   1. ISBN-10: 1400095921\n   2. ISBN-13: 978-1400095926\n\nHeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a charming monster . . .\nA macabre hero . . .\nA serial killer who only kills bad people\n\nDexter Morgan has been under considerable pressure. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just not easy being an ethical serial killerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½especially while trying to avoid the unshakable suspicions of the dangerous Sergeant Doakes (who believes Dexter is a homicidal maniac . . . which, of course, he is). In an attempt to throw Doakes off his trail, Dexter has had to slip deep into his foolproof disguise. While not working as a blood-spatter analyst for the Miami Police Department, he now spends nearly all his time with his cheerful girlfriend, Rita, and her two children, sipping light beer and slowly becoming the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first serial couch potato. But how long can Dexter play Kick the Can instead of Slice the Slasher? How long before his Dark Passenger forces him to drop the charade and let his inner monster run free?\n\nIn trying times, opportunity knocks. A particularly nasty psychopath is cutting a trail through MiamiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a man whose twisted technique leaves even Dexter speechless. As DexterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dark appetite is revived, his sister, Deborah (a newly minted, tough-as-nails Miami detective) is drawn headlong into the case. It quickly becomes clear that it will take a monster to catch a monsterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but it isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t until his archnemesis is abducted that Dex can finally throw himself into the search for a new plaything. Unless, of course, his plaything finds him first . . .\n\nWith the incredible wit and freshness that drew widespread acclaim to Darkly Dreaming Dexter, Jeff Lindsay now takes Dexter Morgan to a new level of macabre appeal and gives us one of the most original, colorful narrators in years.\n\nDEXTER IN THE DARK\n\n   1. ISBN-10: 0307276732\n   2. ISBN-13: 978-0307276735\n\nIn his work as a Miami crime scene investigator, Dexter Morgan is not unaccustomed to seeing evil deedsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦particularly because, on occasion, he commits them himself. Guided by his Dark Passenger (the reptilian voice inside him), he lives his outwardly normal life adhering to one simple rule: he only kills very bad people. But DexterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s happy existence is turned upside-down when he is called to a particularly disturbing crime scene at the university campus. DexterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dark Passenger immediately senses something it recognizes, something utterly chilling, and the Dark PassengerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½mastermind of DexterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s investigative and homicidal prowessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½goes into hiding.\n\nDexter is alone for the first time in his life, and he realizes heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s being hunted by an adversary more sinister than anything heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ever faced. Dexter must summon his sharpest investigative powers not only to pursue his enemy, but to locateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and truly understandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½his Dark Passenger. It is nothing less than a search for his own dark soulÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦fueled by a steady supply of cream-filled donuts.\n\nMacabre, ironic, and wonderfully entertaining, DEXTER IN THE DARK goes deeper into the dark psyche of one of the freshest protagonists in recent fiction.\n\nDEXTER BY DESIGN\n\n   1. ISBN-10: 0385518366\n   2. ISBN-13: 978-0385518369\n\nThe macabre, witty New York Times bestselling series (and inspiration for the #1 Showtime series, Dexter) continues as our darkly lovable killer matches wits with a sadistic artisteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½who is creating bizarre murder tableaux of his own all over Miami.\n\nAfter his surprisingly glorious honeymoon in Paris, life is almost normal for Dexter Morgan. Married life seems to agree with him: heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s devoted to his bride, his stomach is full, and his homicidal hobbies are nicely under control. But old habits die hardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and DexterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work as a blood spatter analyst never fails to offer new temptations that appeal to his offbeat sense of justiceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦and his Dark Passenger still waits to hunt with him in the moonlight.\n\nThe discovery of a corpse (artfully displayed as a sunbather relaxing on a Miami beach chair) naturally piques DexterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s curiosity and MiamiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest realize theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got a terrifying new serial killer on the loose. And Dexter, of course, is back in business.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:223d50b09fe11ac7f9d64be2c721a8da22172d22","amp;dn":"Dexter+1-4+-+Jeff+Lindsay+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"223d50b09fe11ac7f9d64be2c721a8da22172d22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,61,80,176,159,225,26,199,249,214,75,226,199,33,168,218,34,23,45,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
