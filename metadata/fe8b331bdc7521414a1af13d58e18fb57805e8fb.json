This was Leni Riefenstahl&amp;#039;s second ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and only full-length ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ film for the National Socialist Party (NSDAP), and as an award-winning masterpiece of camerawork, direction and editing, it is widely agreed by virtually every film critic to be the greatest propaganda film of all time. As with the two other, shorter films which she did for the NSDAP, Der Sieg des Glaubens (1933) and the later Tag der Freiheit! ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Unsere Wehrmacht! (1935), unlike the typical propaganda films put out by the Nazi party during that period, Triumph des Willens contains no running commentary and thus could technically rather be considered to be a documentary film, and with its style perhaps even an art film. However, the propagandistic political value of this film in promoting Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party is also clearly undeniable, its effect on the people of Germany and, indeed, the entire world is a matter of record and history, and in that regard it may very well be perhaps the most significant, most influential ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and certainly the most infamously controversial ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ film of the 20th century.\n\nDirector:\nLeni Riefenstahl\nWriters:\nLeni Riefenstahl (writer)\nWalter Ruttmann (writer)\n\n\n[Cast]\n\nAdolf Hitler\nMax Amann\nMartin Bormann\nWalter Buch\nRichard Walther DarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©\nOtto Dietrich\nSepp Dietrich\nHans Frank\nJoseph Goebbels\nHermann GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ring\nJakob Grimminger\nRudolf Hess\nReinhard Heydrich\nKonstantin Hierl\nHeinrich Himmler\nRobert Ley\nViktor Lutze\nErich Raeder\nFritz Reinhardt\nAlfred Rosenberg\nHjalmar Schacht\nFranz Schwarz\nJulius Streicher\nFritz Todt\nWerner von Blomberg\nHans Georg von Friedeburg\nGerd von Rundstedt\nBaldur von Schirach\nAdolf Wagner\nand\nThe Soldiers of the SA, SS &amp; Wehrmacht\nThe Hitlerjugend\nplus\nother participants of the Party Rally\nand\nthe citizens of Nuremberg\n\n\nAwards\n\nNational Film Prize (1934-1935)\nVenice International Film Festival (1935) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Coppa dell&amp;#039;Istituto Nazionale LUCE\nMedaille d&amp;#039;Or &amp; Grand Prix de France (1937)\n\nPremiere\n\nMarch 28, 1935 (UFA-Palast am Zoo, Berlin)\n\n\nThe sequences (not including opening and closing titles/credits) from the film are:\n\n   1.
