Smackwater Jack\n\n\nFour decades later, Carole King's Tapestry still can hold it's own and will forever be a landmark album. The proof is sure in that Carole King is touring again, with James Taylor, and singing the time-enduring songs she penned long ago. Tapestry features the two hit songs It's Too Late and I Feel The Earth Move, and King's own version of You've Got A Friend: the greatness of this album lies in the incredible quality of the songs. A classic masterpiece.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 36\nArtist: Carole King\nAlbum: Tapestry\nYear: 1971\nGenre: Singer/Songwriting\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f95e29c77a7e3f78ef8a7218548bed5f79cd74ae","amp;dn":"Carole+King+-+Tapestry+%5BFLAC-1971%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f95e29c77a7e3f78ef8a7218548bed5f79cd74ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,94,41,199,122,126,63,120,239,138,114,24,84,139,237,95,121,205,116,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
