Oh, Mama\n\nThe name Ã¢â‚¬â€ pronounced EEE-fah, by the way Ã¢â‚¬â€ might not be immediately recognizable, but singer/songwriter Aoife OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Donovan is no newcomer. She has already spent a decade fronting and releasing five studio albums with the progressive bluegrass band Crooked Still. In her spare time she contributed to the all-female acoustic act Sometymes Why. But she waited until her only choice for producer, Tucker Martine, could work with her to record this stunning solo debut.\n\nSharp-eyed roots music fans will recognize the opening track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lay My Burden Down,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ from Alison KraussÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ 2011 cover. OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢DonovanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s version adds a reverbed surf guitar that comes out of nowhere, bringing an edge never hinted at in KraussÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ more traditional version. As the album progresses, OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Donovan slathers her hushed, sexy vocals over a potent combination of folk, pop and country influenced music that simmers with white heat. Her backup musicians bring tensile heft to melodies such as the sultry Ã¢â‚¬Å“Red &amp; White &amp; Blue &amp; GoldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (watch her perform a gorgeous solo version in the American Songwriter offices here) that seem familiar the first time you hear them. OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢DonovanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s subtle phrasing on the shimmering Ã¢â‚¬Å“Glowing HeartÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is provided a boost when a mournful violin suddenly appears, pushing the tune into an edgy melancholy that will give you chills. A jazz undercurrent throbs under the surface of Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m AloneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that, along with ominously thumping drums, conveys a slightly uncomfortable vibe.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a terrific and enriching listen, especially with headphones, where the singerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s supple voice and imaginative lyrics along with MartineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sympathetic production dovetail with an effortless grace. The 10 songs unfold in a nimble 40 minutes that show OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢DonovanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s years of preparation for this long delayed solo project. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an auspicious beginning for what will hopefully be a fertile career where she is no longer cloaked under another bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s banner.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:032bf92d0fed02645c681b9637d8a98bfeee2420","amp;dn":"Aoife+O%27Donovan+-+Fossils+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"032bf92d0fed02645c681b9637d8a98bfeee2420","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,43,249,45,15,237,2,100,92,104,27,150,55,216,169,139,254,238,36,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
