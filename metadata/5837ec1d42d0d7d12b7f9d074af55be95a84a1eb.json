It was released in 2007 as a double CD / triple vinyl on 28 October in Australia, 29 October in Europe, and 30 October in the US.\n\nIt was recorded in Montreal, Quebec, Canada at the Montreal Forum on 24 November and 25 November 1981, ten years to the date before lead singer Freddie Mercury died of complications related to AIDS. Allmusic described Queen's performance in Montreal as being &quot;deliberately theatrical and often majestic&quot;.\n\nThis marks the first official release of the film soundtrack to the concert film We Will Rock You on an audio-only format. Unlike the original video release of We Will Rock You, which has been re-released as Queen Rock Montreal, the album and CD features the full show (including &quot;Flash&quot; and &quot;The Hero&quot;) fully remixed.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nDisc 1\n\n    &quot;Intro&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:59\n    &quot;We Will Rock You (Fast)&quot; (Brian May) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:06\n    &quot;Let Me Entertain You&quot; (Freddie Mercury) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:48\n    &quot;Play the Game&quot; (Mercury) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:57\n    &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; (Mercury) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:53\n    &quot;Killer Queen&quot; (Mercury) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:59\n    &quot;I'm in Love with My Car&quot; (Roger Taylor) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:03\n    &quot;Get Down, Make Love&quot; (Mercury) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:45\n    &quot;Save Me&quot; (May) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:14\n    &quot;Now I'm Here&quot; (May) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:31\n    &quot;Dragon Attack&quot; (May) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:11\n    &quot;Now I'm Here (Reprise)&quot; (May) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:53\n    &quot;Love of My Life&quot; (Mercury) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:56\n\nDisc 2\n\n    &quot;Under Pressure&quot; (Queen, David Bowie) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:49\n    &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; (May) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:29\n    &quot;Drum and Tympani Solo&quot; (Taylor) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:00\n    &quot;Guitar Solo&quot; (May) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:11\n    &quot;Flash&quot; (May) * Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:11\n    &quot;The Hero&quot; (May) * Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:51\n    &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; (Mercury) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:15\n    &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; (Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:32\n    &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; (Mercury) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:28\n    &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot; (May) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:52\n    &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; (John Deacon) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:00\n    &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; (Taylor) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:53\n    &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; (May) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:09\n    &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; (Mercury) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:27\n    &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; (tape) (arr.
