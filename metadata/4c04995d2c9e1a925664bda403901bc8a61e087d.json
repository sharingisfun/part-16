Their second album was recorded in a barn in rural Ontario; the sounds of the creaking doors and other background noise are heard in the songs. A third album was recorded in collaboration with the band Jackie-O Motherfucker but never released.\n\nMany of their tracks are very minimalist in nature, filled with ambient noise and various other non-musical sound effects, juxtaposed or combined with instrumental music.\n\nThe band is often considered a side project of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and the two musical ensembles share several members.\n\nMore info here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.alien8recordings.com/artists/set-fire-to-flames&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.alien8recordings.com/artists/set-fire-to-flames&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_Fire_to_Flames&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_Fire_to_Flames&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sings_Reign_Rebuilder&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sings_Reign_Rebuilder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphs_in_Negative/Mouths_Trapped_in_Static&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphs_in_Negative/Mouths_Trapped_in_Static&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---\n\nthis torrent contains both of SFtFs albums, 2001s Sings Reign Rebuilder and 2003s Telegraphs in Negative/Mouths Trapped in Static as well as 1000x1000 artwork for both.
