The main research task for mechatronics is development and control of advanced hybrid systems covering all these fields and supported by interdisciplinary studies\nThis book presents recent state of advances in mechatronics presented on the 7th International Conference Mechatronics 2007, hosted at the Faculty of Mechatronics, Warsaw University of Technology, Poland. The chosen topics of the conference included: Nanotechnology, Automatic Control and Robotics, Biomedical Engineering, Design Manufacturing and Testing of MEMS, Metrology, Photonics, Mechatronic Products. The selected papers give an overview of the state-of-the-art and present new research results and prospects of the future development in this interdisciplinary field of mechatronic systems. This book will provide up-to-date and useful knowledge for researchers and engineers involved in mechatronics and related fields.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5aa908001437de5a5f43e1ea505923134191a76","amp;dn":"Recent+Advances+in+Mechatronics-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5aa908001437de5a5f43e1ea505923134191a76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,170,144,128,1,67,125,229,165,244,62,30,165,5,146,49,52,25,26,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
