Sly Stone's gift for irresistible dance songs is a matter of world acclaim, but his gift for political anthems that are uplifting but never simplistic or sentimental is a gas. And oh yeah--his rhythms are amazing&quot; A+\n- Robert Christgau, Village Voice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c251890a3eb1ea49bf535dae84a83e6d8ddec099","amp;dn":"Sly+and+the+Family+Stone+-+Greatest+Hits+%281970+quad+mix+24%2F96+lo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c251890a3eb1ea49bf535dae84a83e6d8ddec099","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,81,137,10,62,177,234,73,191,83,93,174,132,168,62,109,141,222,192,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
