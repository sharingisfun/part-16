Right after they make a sandwich. Or play\nsome video games. Wait, there's laundry to do. (&quot;Not it!&quot;) After that, they'll\ndefinitely go fight some crime. Maybe... Inspired by the original hit series\nTeen Titans from Warner Bros. Animation, TEEN TITANS GO! features the return of\nRobin, Starfire, Raven, Beast Boy and Cyborg in all-new comedic adventures. These\nfive super hero teens have more than just super powers - they have super-sized\nchores to do and they're super unsupervised! Saving the world might seem like a\npretty big deal, but after fighting evil all day in Jump City, the last thing\nthese teens want to do is fight over the remote back home at Titans Tower or have\nto clean up after a marathon pizza party. So get ready for comedic mayhem punctuated\nby pranks as the teens totally annoy each other, with a splash of crime fighting.\nUnless there's something good on TV...\n\nProduced by DC Comics, Cartoon Network and Warner Bros. Animation.\n\n\nTeen.Titans.Go.S01E18-23.720p.WEB-DL.x264.AAC\n\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 1280x720 23.976fps [CRF 20.0 - PS3 Preset]\nAudio: MPEG4 Audio (AAC) 48000Hz stereo  [128Kbps ABR]\nSubs: English Closed Captions (SubRip Text)\n\n\nS01E18a - Second Christmas  [164 MB - 11m 01s]\nS01E18b - Nose Mouth        [141 MB - 11m 11s]\nS01E19a - Legs              [140 MB - 11m 07s]\nS01E19b - Breakfast Cheese  [158 MB - 11m 12s]\nS01E20a - Waffles           [156 MB - 11m 01s]\nS01E20b - Opposites         [126 MB - 11m 03s]\nS01E21a - Birds             [149 MB - 11m 10s]\nS01E21b - Be Mine           [130 MB - 11m 11s]\nS01E22a - Brain Food        [115 MB - 11m 10s]\nS01E22b - In and Out        [138 MB - 11m 10s]\nS01E23a - Little Buddies    [161 MB - 11m 11s]\nS01E23b - Missing           [141 MB - 11m 11s]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08d0f7d66ba1e2f2016615fdfce752dac692eac5","amp;dn":"Teen.Titans.Go.S01E18-23.720p.WEB-DL.x264.AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08d0f7d66ba1e2f2016615fdfce752dac692eac5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,208,247,214,107,161,226,242,1,102,21,253,252,231,82,218,198,146,234,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
