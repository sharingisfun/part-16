What's the world's worst idea for a sci-fi film? What's the biggest balls-up in sporting history? \nThese are the kind of questions facing the panel of comedians taking part in So Wrong It's Right.\n\nEach week, Charlie plunders his guests' pasts, creativity and general knowledge over a series of rounds in which panellists have to be wrong to be right. The aim for Charlie's guests is to come up with the wrongest answer to each question they're asked, with Charlie awarding a point to whoever he decides gave the most inappropriate answer.\n\n\n\nwww.comedy.co.uk Review: \nWe've been really enjoying this programme. \nSome people have complained that it features the same guests all panel shows have (i.e. David Mitchell), but the programme does have some great moments.\n\nCast:\nCharlie Brooker\n\nPanellists Include\nDavid Mitchell\nRufus Hound\nVictoria Coren\nLee Mack\nJosie Long\nTom Basden \nRichard Herring\nHolly Walsh\nIain Morris\nLiza Tarbuck\nJack Whitehall\nSarah Millican\nLee Mack\nIain Morris\nHolly Walsh\nMark Watson\nFrank Skinner\nIsy Suttie\nJon Richardson\nShappi Khorsandi\nDavid Schneider\nSharon Horgan\nFergus Craig\nGraham Linehan \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/so_wrong_its_right/episodes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/so_wrong_its_right/episodes/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSo Wrong It's Right - S01 - E01\nSo Wrong It's Right - S01 - E02\nSo Wrong It's Right - S01 - E03\nSo Wrong It's Right - S01 - E04\nSo Wrong It's Right - S01 - E05\n\nSo Wrong It's Right - S02 - E01\nSo Wrong It's Right - S02 - E02\nSo Wrong It's Right - S02 - E03\nSo Wrong It's Right - S02 - E04\nSo Wrong It's Right - S02 - E05\nSo Wrong It's Right - S02 - E06\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 27mn 0s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n\n\n===============================================\n\nI post quite a few torrents if this site is down when I post a new one I don't have time to keep trying.\nIf it's down then it's skipped.\n\nYou can follow me on Twitter so you don't miss any\n\n\nOr add the RSS feed in uTorrent (In FEEDS on the left add)\n\n\n===============================================\n\n\nI often get asked to recommend some comedy.
