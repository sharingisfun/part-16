Heckscher, &quot;Creating Central Park&quot;\nPublisher: Metropolitan Museum of Art | 2008 | ISBN: 0300136692 | English | PDF | 76 pages | 18.72 Mb\n\nThe year 2008 marks the 150th anniversary of the design of Central Park, the first and arguably the most famous of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s urban landscape parks. In October 1857 the new parkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s board of commissioners announced a public design competition, and the following April the imaginative yet practicable Ã¢â‚¬Å“GreenswardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ plan submitted by Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted was selected.\n\nThis book tells the fascinating story of how an extraordinary work of public art emerged from the crucible of New York City politics. From William Cullen BryantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1844 editorial calling for Ã¢â‚¬Å“a pleasure ground of shade and recreationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the completion of construction in 1870, the history of Central Park is an urban epicÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œa tale not only of animosity, political intrigue, and desire but also of idealism, sacrifice, and genius.\n\nPress reviews\n&quot;A detailed narrative of the politics, aesthetics, and planning involved in the park's creation, accompanied by a rich trove of illustrations. ... [No other book on Central Park] can match the combination of narrative and graphic detail.&quot; - Y.
