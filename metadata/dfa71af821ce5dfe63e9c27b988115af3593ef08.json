Productions in 2010 - English narration\n\n\nInformation\n------------------------------\n\nNazi Collaborators \nThis series looks at the many people who chose to collaborate with the Nazis. It is at times, uncomfortable viewing, but it's also totally absorbing too. It's a simple question. &quot;How could they have done it?&quot; How could anyone have collaborated with the Nazis? And yet so many did. From Pierre Laval in France to Chaim Rumkowski, who ran the Jewish administration in the Lodz ghetto, from Quisling to the IRA, from the 1600 Belgians who served in the SS to the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem - all worked with the Nazis. Many of these people did what they did out of the best intentions. Others felt they had no choice. Others still had darker and more disturbing motives. This series will draw upon WMR Productions unrivalled 4000 hours of archive, much of which has never been seen before. At the heart of this 13 part series lies one uneasy question. If you had faced what these people had faced, might you have done the same thing - and danced with the devil? All the stories are told through the experiences of individuals who were prominent collaborators. Through this we will give the full background of collaboration in nations and places across Europe and the Middle East.It is one of the final unexplored topics in the history of the war - as most of these secrets have been kept firmly locked away in the post war era.\n\n\n\n\n12)  The Good Collaborators \nFinland today is one of the most prosperous countries in the world but in World War Two, it was fighting to survive against the odds. This is the story of how the Finns negotiated an alliance with one of the most evil regimes the world has ever seen. It details the compromises they made, or felt they had to make to ensure their country remained free of communism and of Russian rule.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img254/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img254/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img195/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img195/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img132/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img132/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img593/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img593/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img607/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img607/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img685/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img685/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img132/1696/nazicollaboratorsscreenq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img132/1696/nazicollaboratorsscreenq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img96/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img96/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img528/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img528/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1915 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 52.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 13\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by Harry65\n * Thanks to llambert\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.worldmediarights.com/index.php?hidAction=episode&amp;eid=517&amp;name=Chaim_Rumkowski&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.worldmediarights.com/index.php?hidAction=episode&amp;eid=517&amp;name=Chaim_Rumkowski&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfa71af821ce5dfe63e9c27b988115af3593ef08","amp;dn":"Nazi+Collaborators+12of13+The+Good+Collaborators+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfa71af821ce5dfe63e9c27b988115af3593ef08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,167,26,248,33,206,93,254,99,233,194,123,152,129,21,175,53,147,239,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
