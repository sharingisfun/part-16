Maybe it's straight from an ACTUAL digital source and not a scan at all. Idk, but I do know that the size of comic book scans is becoming unreasonably and unnecessarily large, regardless of what type of image or compression is being used. The human eye/brain simply cannot detect a difference between a great scan and an &quot;omg look at what resolution we can scan at now!&quot; Bigger does not always equal better. Anyway... steps off soap box...\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe March of the Crabs - The Crabby Condition (digital) \n\nArchaia, 2015, 117 pages\n\nWritten and Illustrated by Arthur de Pins\n\nCrabs versus The World.\n\nAll species in the world evolveÃ¢â‚¬Â¦except one. Cancer Simplicimus Vulgaris, or the square crab, has suffered with the same evolutionary defect for millennia: it cannot change direction. Condemned to walk in one straight line forever, these crabs living along the Gironde estuary have largely resigned themselves to their fate. However, one seemingly ordinary summer, three crabs decide to take matters into their own claws and rebel against the straight and narrow path they have been sentenced to, upending the entire ecosystem in the process. From critically-acclaimed French illustrator and animator Arthur de Pins comes the first volume in his hilarious and touching trilogy about scuttling towards your own destiny.\n\n&quot;How about you shut up? Given our positions, you're talking to my ass anyway, and it's not a great conversationalist.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:209606402b3a189dd3e3162290725debb09d3c90","amp;dn":"March+of+the+Crabs++-+The+Crabby+Condition+%282015%29+%28digital%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"209606402b3a189dd3e3162290725debb09d3c90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,150,6,64,43,58,24,157,211,227,22,34,144,114,93,235,176,157,60,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
