Using CM best practices, IT professionals can systematically manage change, avoiding unexpected problems introduced by changes to hardware, software, or networks. Now, todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best CM practices have been gathered in one indispensable resource showing you how to implement them throughout any agile or traditional development organization.\n\n \n\nConfiguration Management Best Practices is practical, easy to understand and apply, and fully reflects the day-to-day realities faced by practitioners. Bob Aiello and Leslie Sachs thoroughly address all six Ã¢â‚¬Å“pillarsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of CM: source code management, build engineering, environment configuration, change control, release engineering, and deployment. They demonstrate how to implement CM in ways that support software and systems development, meet compliance rules such as SOX and SAS-70, anticipate emerging standards such as IEEE/ISO 12207, and integrate with modern frameworks such as ITIL, COBIT, and CMMI. Coverage includes\n\n \n\n    Using CM to meet business objectives, contractual requirements, and compliance rules\n    Enhancing quality and productivity through lean processes and Ã¢â‚¬Å“just-in-timeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ process improvement\n    Getting off to a good start in organizations without effective CM\n    Implementing a Core CM Best Practices Framework that supports the entire development lifecycle\n    Mastering the Ã¢â‚¬Å“peopleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ side of CM: rightsizing processes, overcoming resistance, and understanding\n    workplace psychology\n    Architecting applications to take full advantage of CM best practices\n    Establishing effective IT controls and compliance\n    Managing tradeoffs and costs and avoiding expensive pitfalls\n\n \n\nConfiguration Management Best Practices is the essential resource for everyone concerned with CM: from CTOs and CIOs to development, QA, and project managers and software engineers to analysts, testers, and compliance professionals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2d36074cd76a0552ae2c25a4ccabd72b0444ac3","amp;dn":"Configuration+Management+Best+Practices+-+Practical+Methods+that","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2d36074cd76a0552ae2c25a4ccabd72b0444ac3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,211,96,116,205,118,160,85,42,226,194,90,76,202,189,114,176,68,74,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
