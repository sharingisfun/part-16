All your favorite characters are back wearing all your favorite unlaundered fetish costumes! See Trinity leap - A LOT! See Morpheus fold his hands and talk - a lot A LOT! Thrill as the Oracle and Neo have long drawn-out conversations to the effect of, &quot;Yea, but if you know that what you know is unknowable, how can you know that what you don&amp;#039;t know isn&amp;#039;t unknowable, too, you know?&quot; And this without them having consumed half a pan of magic brownies while sitting in front of an Alf marathon!\n\nBut more than anything else, Matrix Reloaded is loaded and loaded again (see diaper reference, above) with NIST Certified Assloads of Agent Smith! Hugo Weaving brings his mouthful of Busey-esque, Chicklet-y teeth to this Neo-punching, &quot;Mr. Anderson&quot;-saying role.\n\nKevin, Mike and Bill re-load the RiffTrax recording studio for another go at the most Whoa-eriffic movie franchise ever!\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\nIncludes a separate AVI with the hilarious Rifftrax intro.\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rifftrax.com/donate.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rifftrax.com/donate.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis torrent was created to simplify the confusing Rifftrax syncing process. Having the riff and the film all in one AVI file or DVD is a million times more enjoyable than trying to sync everything together. Plus Disembaudio is annoying.\n\nThe makers of the original movie I don&amp;#039;t give a CRAP about, but the Rifftrax crew Mike, Bill, Kevin, and all their employees) need $ to keep making these!\n\nRIFFS ONLY COST $4!!! PLEASE DONATE IF YOU ENJOY THIS RIFFTRAX!!!\n\nThanks,\nAnna\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rifftrax.com/donate.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rifftrax.com/donate.php&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59aa9fed67786ea399759639d86e9715aebf6b57","amp;dn":"Matrix+Reloaded+Rifftrax+%28AVI%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59aa9fed67786ea399759639d86e9715aebf6b57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,170,159,237,103,120,110,163,153,117,150,57,216,110,151,21,174,191,107,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
