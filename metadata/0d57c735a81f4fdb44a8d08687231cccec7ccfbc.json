The Greystoke Legacy\nRobbie Canler flees to the Congo to escape a dark secret, and finds work with an illegal logging operation. Suddenly, his camp is attacked by a savage force. When Jane Porter, the daughter of the campÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s boss, goes missing, the loggers assume bloodthirsty rebel soldiers have kidnapped her. Spurred into action, Robbie sets out alone to find herÃ¢â‚¬â€completely unaware that he is being watched.\n\nCaught in the midst of the many dangers that lie in the depths of the jungle, Robbie wonders if the rumors of a supernatural white ape are true. And if so, can this mysterious untamed savage be trusted to help, or will it destroy them all?\n\n2. The Jungle Warrior\nThe worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most infamous hunter, Nikolas Rokoff, is sent into the jungle to steal a rare prize from TarzanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s camp. But Tarzan and his friends Jane and Robbie will stop at nothing to track him downÃ¢â‚¬â€crossing the wild rainforest and hostile African savannah on a daring rescue mission.\n\nAt the same time, Jane tries to learn more about TarzanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past, and must decide whether reuniting him with his lost family is the right thing to do. And Robbie is torn by a plan that would keep the secrets of his own past safe, but might get rid of Tarzan for good.\n\n3. The Savage Lands\nIn the third book in the Tarzan series, the treacherous Lord Greystoke arrives at the logger's camp in the Congo, and will stop at nothing to find and assassinate his long-lost cousin, Tarzan. Robbie and Jane set out through the jungle to warn Tarzan, and find themselves trapped in the sprawling ancient city of Opar, where the insane Queen La runs an illegal coltan mine. With a volcano threatening to explode, Tarzan, Robbie, and Jane must form an unlikely alliance to save themselves. Not everyone will make it out alive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d57c735a81f4fdb44a8d08687231cccec7ccfbc","amp;dn":"Tarzan+Series+by+Andy+Briggs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d57c735a81f4fdb44a8d08687231cccec7ccfbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,87,199,53,168,31,79,219,68,168,208,134,135,35,28,204,236,124,207,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
