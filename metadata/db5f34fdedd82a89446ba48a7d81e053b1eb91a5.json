From the start, their fates were intertwined, with the band releasing its first single in July 1981, just weeks before the network premiered its first music video. From that point on, MTV documented everything about R.E.M, their music, their stories, and ultimately, their decision to disband in 2011.\n\nThis entire story, beginning to end, is chronicled in REMTV, a new six-DVD set that includes live performances, award show highlights, and television appearances, as well as a new documentary about their shared history.\n\nThe first disc combines both of the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s performances on MTV Unplugged (1991 and 2001) and features the outtakes that debuted earlier this year on the audio release Unplugged: The Complete 1991 And 2001 Sessions.\n\nThe bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1998 appearance on VH1Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Storytellers opens the second disc, and has been expanded with unaired performances of several songs, including Ã¢â‚¬Å“New Test LeperÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“(DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Go Back to) Rockville.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Also featured are performances taken from various MTV award shows through the years, as well as the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2007 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nThe next three discs present a trove of rare live performances recorded between 1995 and 2008 in countries around the world. Of the 99 songs that are spread across these three discs, nearly half are unique song titles, offering a deep exploration of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s live legacy. Especially noteworthy are two massive free concerts filmed for broadcast: Live In Cologne (5/12/01) and R.E.M. Live In Athens, Greece (10/5/08). More than a dozen songs from those shows did not air during the original broadcasts. Both concerts appear here in their entirety for the first time.\n\nUndoubtedly, the heart of this superb collection is the new feature-length documentary, R.E.M. By MTV, included on the final disc. Drawing exclusively on archival events, the film traces R.E.M. and MTV in real time, which makes it feel as exciting and immediate as it did when it was happening","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db5f34fdedd82a89446ba48a7d81e053b1eb91a5","amp;dn":"REMTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db5f34fdedd82a89446ba48a7d81e053b1eb91a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,95,52,253,237,216,42,137,68,107,164,138,125,129,224,83,177,235,145,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
