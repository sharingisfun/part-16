The VAN method of earthquake prediction, based on the detection and measurement of low frequency electric signals called Seismic Electric Signals (SES), has been researched and evaluated over 30 years, and now constitutes the only earthquake prediction effort that has led to concrete successful results. This book recounts the history of the VAN method, detailing how it has developed and been tested under international scrutiny.\n\nEarthquake Prediction by Seismic Electric Signals\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ describes, step by step, the development of the VAN method since 1981;\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ explains both the theoretical model underpinning the research and the physical properties of SES;\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ analyzes the SES recordings and the prediction for each major earthquake in Greece over the last 25 years;\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ introduces a new time domain, natural time, which plays a key role in predicting impending catastrophic events.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPDF: 259 pages\nPublisher: Springer; 2013 edition (July 27, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 364224405X\nISBN-13: 978-3642244056\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98b4365460704f51cb8e846e12e74a44d4fadff6","amp;dn":"Earthquake+Prediction+by+Seismic+Electric+Signals+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98b4365460704f51cb8e846e12e74a44d4fadff6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,180,54,84,96,112,79,81,203,142,132,110,18,231,74,68,212,250,223,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
