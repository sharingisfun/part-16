We're LulzSec, and welcome to Sownage. Enclosed you will\nfind various collections of data stolen from internal Sony networks and websites,\nall of which we accessed easily and without the need for outside support or money.\n\nWe recently broke into SonyPictures.com and compromised over 1,000,000 users' \npersonal information, including passwords, email addresses, home addresses, \ndates of birth, and all Sony opt-in data associated with their accounts. \nAmong other things, we also compromised all admin details of Sony Pictures \n(including passwords) along with 75,000 &quot;music codes&quot; and 3.5 million &quot;music coupons&quot;.\n\nDue to a lack of resource on our part (The Lulz Boat needs additional funding!) \nwe were unable to fully copy all of this information, however we have samples \nfor you in our files to prove its authenticity. In theory we could have taken\nevery last bit of information, but it would have taken several more weeks.\n\nOur goal here is not to come across as master hackers, hence what we're about \nto reveal: SonyPictures.com was owned by a very simple SQL injection, one of \nthe most primitive and common vulnerabilities, as we should all know by now. \nFrom a single injection, we accessed EVERYTHING. Why do you put such faith in \na company that allows itself to become open to these simple attacks?\n\nWhat's worse is that every bit of data we took wasn't encrypted. Sony stored\nover 1,000,000 passwords of its customers in plaintext, which means it's just\na matter of taking it. This is disgraceful and insecure: they were asking for it.\n\nThis is an embarrassment to Sony; the SQLi link is provided in our file contents, \nand we invite anyone with the balls to check for themselves that what we say\nis true. You may even want to plunder those 3.5 million coupons while you can.\n\nIncluded in our collection are databases from Sony BMG Belgium &amp; Netherlands.\nThese also contain varied assortments of Sony user and staffer information.\n\nFollow our sexy asses on twitter to hear about our upcoming website. Ciao! ^_^","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eff786985661f3d4447c66110435beddbe96d2f9","amp;dn":"Sownage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eff786985661f3d4447c66110435beddbe96d2f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,247,134,152,86,97,243,212,68,124,102,17,4,53,190,221,190,150,210,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
