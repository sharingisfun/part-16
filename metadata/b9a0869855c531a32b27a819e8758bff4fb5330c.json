A secular Jew born in the Ukraine, Wiesenthal survived the Holocaust but lost 89 members of his own and his wife's family in the concentration camps. He dedicated more than six decades of his life to tracking down Nazi war criminals. An architect by trade, he never practiced this profession after the war. Not only did Wiesenthal succeed in contributing to the prosecution of 1,100 war criminals, he was also one of the first to draw public attention to the camps where more than 12 million gypsies, homosexuals, Jews, Russian POWs, German political prisoners, and many others were systematically executed under Nazi rule.\n\n\n**NOTE** A brilliant HBO Dramatization entitled &quot;Murderers Among Us: The Simon Wiesenthal Story (1989) is available - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097933/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9a0869855c531a32b27a819e8758bff4fb5330c","amp;dn":"I+Have+Never+Forgotten+You+-+Simon+Wiesenthal+%28Holocaust+-+Nazi+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9a0869855c531a32b27a819e8758bff4fb5330c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,160,134,152,85,197,49,163,43,39,168,25,232,117,139,255,79,181,51,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
