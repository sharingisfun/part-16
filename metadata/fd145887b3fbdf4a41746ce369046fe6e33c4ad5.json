They discuss, among other topics, the Doctor's philosophy of science, the ethics of a universe with millions of intelligent species, what makes one life-form more important than another, whether time travelers can change history, and how the Doctor Who TV show is changing the world we live in. The chapters draw freely on both the classic series (1963Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1989) and the new series. The book includes a collection of entertaining and insightful quotes from Doctor Who plus a complete list of episodes and companions.&quot;\n\nThe torrent folder contains the original retail quality EPUB as well as conversions into MOBI, LIT, AZW3 and large print PDF formats done in Calibre.
