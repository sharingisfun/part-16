These Mwenda recordings surfaced in the archive after Michael Baird had completed the series and we felt that we could not let them fall back into oblivion. This album is the perfect introduction to Hugh Tracey's recordings.\n\nQuality: 128Kbps + cover\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8453b1e5a27abef1d2a57e9e44c2e6aebce13ddb","amp;dn":"AFRICA+-+Very+Best+Of+Hugh+Tracey+Recordings+%281943-1963%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8453b1e5a27abef1d2a57e9e44c2e6aebce13ddb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,83,177,229,162,122,190,241,210,165,126,158,68,194,230,174,188,225,61,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
