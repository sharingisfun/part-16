It covers the saddlery, horse furniture, and personal equipment of the British horsed cavalryman from the early stages of the Napoleonic Wars until the final disappearance of the mounted arm during World War II. Such details are essential for an understanding of how cavalry fought in the 19th and early 20th centuries, since the design of equipment was intimately connected with cavalry tactics in any particular period.Students of campaign history, and particularly modellers, will find here a mass of specific information, illustrated with photographs, diagrams, drawings and full colour plates","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdef23c3ef85320af1316e5033a54d2e678df9ca","amp;dn":"British+Cavalry+Equipments+1800-1941","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdef23c3ef85320af1316e5033a54d2e678df9ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,239,35,195,239,133,50,10,241,49,110,80,51,165,77,46,103,141,249,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
