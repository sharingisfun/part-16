For example, before performing &quot;Trampled Under Foot&quot;, Plant asks &quot;Is there anybody on the spotlights who could find us a badgeholder?&quot;\n\nThe release is notable not only for the band's strong performance and superb sound quality recording, but also for the surprise guest, Keith Moon from The Who. Moon plays throughout the nearly 20 minute drum solo and returns later for the encores.\n\n\n\nThe setlist is:\n\n   1. &quot;Intro&quot; - (1:47)\n   2. &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; (Page, Plant) - (5:26)\n   3. &quot;The Rover (intro)\n   4. &quot;Sick Again&quot;(Page, Plant) - (6:56)\n   5. &quot;Nobody's Fault but Mine&quot; (Page, Plant) - (7:14)\n   6. &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot; (Page, Plant) - (7:20)\n   7. &quot;No Quarter&quot; (Page, Plant, Jones) - (31:00)\n   8. &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot; (Page, Plant, Jones) - (8:50)\n   9. &quot;Ten Years Gone&quot; (Page, Plant) - (10:35)\n  10. &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; (Page, Plant) - (7:21)\n  11. &quot;Going to California&quot; (Page, Plant) - (6:40)\n  12. &quot;Black Country Woman&quot; (Page, Plant) - (3:04)\n  13. &quot;Bron-Yr-Aur (Stomp)&quot; (Page, Plant, Jones) - (5:40)\n  14. &quot;White Summer&quot;/&quot;Black Mountain Side&quot; (Page - (9:33)\n  15. &quot;Kashmir&quot; (Page, Plant, Jones) - (9:46)\n  16. &quot;Trampled Underfoot&quot; - (Page, Plant, Jones)\n  17. &quot;Out on the Tiles&quot; / &quot;Over The Top&quot;/&quot;Moby Dick&quot; (with Keith Moon) - (Page, Plant, Bonham)\n  18. &quot;Jimmy Page Guitar Solo&quot; (Page)\n  19. &quot;Achilles Last Stand&quot; (Page, Plant)\n  20. &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; (Page, Plant)\n  21. &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; / &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; (encore) (with Keith Moon)\n\n\n\nAll tracks are 256 kB/s.  Unfortunately, I do not have this in FLAC, so if you happen to have it, upload it for the rest of us.\n\n\nEDIT:  It has been brought to my attention that the tracks are not in the proper order.  Use the guide mqrkeredd has posted for the correct one.  I would reupload my files, but I don't want to lose the seeders from this one.  Sorry about that.\n\n\nThanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d57f88332b9a8c683ab251c486e5b0393318cd0","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+For+Badgeholders+Only+%286%2F27%2F1977%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d57f88332b9a8c683ab251c486e5b0393318cd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,87,248,131,50,185,168,198,131,171,37,28,72,110,91,3,147,49,140,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
