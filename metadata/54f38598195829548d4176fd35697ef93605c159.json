ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“BlankÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, described as an intense psycho-thriller by director Rick L. Winters, will debut on DVD but you can get it for free on BitTorrent too - with the blessing of the entire cast and crew.\n\n\n\nAnnodam Films will released the feature film 'Blank' from writer director Rick L. Winters on March 21, 2009 on Mininova and other torrent sites for everyone to enjoy. It is our concept that if people like the movie they will go back and make a donation or purchase the movie at www.blank-movie.com, thus allowing us to make another film and release it in the same manner. After the end credits of the movie BLANK there will be a trailer for one of the next feature films we are planning to film and release Peer to Peer. \n\nPlot......\n\nThe film, 'Blank', is the story of a young boy who witnesses the violent death of his parents. The story fast forwards 20 years and our young man finds himself involved with organized crime, his stepfather is the crime boss. While watching a poker game he overhears who murdered his parents and vows revenge. We follow our central character for the next 20 hours as he plans and executes his revenge. He picks his father up from prison, solicits assistance in his plan and becomes unwittingly involved with a pair of serial killers. There are side plots involving the crime boss's wife and an affair and a bizarre and shocking twist at the end. The film would be best described as a psycho/thriller. We meet other characters living separate lives whose paths all cross at the point of our hero's revenge\n\n\n\nVideo: 640x272px (480p), x264\nAudio: 128kbit/s, AAC\nGenre: Psycho-Thriller\nRuntime: 96 minutes\n\n\n\nGo here if you would like to donate &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.blank-movie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.blank-movie.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54f38598195829548d4176fd35697ef93605c159","amp;dn":"Blank+%5B2009%5D+480p+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54f38598195829548d4176fd35697ef93605c159","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,243,133,152,25,88,41,84,141,65,118,253,53,105,126,249,54,5,193,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
