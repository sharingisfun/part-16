Edmond Dantes, a young, energetic sailor, is falsely accused of treason on his wedding day and incarcerated in the forbidding Chateau d&amp;#039;If. His escape and ultimate revenge on those who wronged him makes this one of the most thrilling stories in French literature, as compelling now as when it was first published in 1846.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4234653389baea1f1be4331204b4ed813e12a18","amp;dn":"Alexandre+Dumas+-+The+Count+Of+Monte+Cristo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4234653389baea1f1be4331204b4ed813e12a18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,35,70,83,56,155,174,161,241,190,67,49,32,75,78,216,19,225,42,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
