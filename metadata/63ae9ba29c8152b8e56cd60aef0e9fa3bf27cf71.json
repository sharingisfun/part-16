Professor Jibin Park walks you through economic ideas using real world examples, and focuses on understanding complex graphs. Jibin has been teaching AP Microeconomics for 8+ years and has been an AP grader for 6+ years, so he knows what it takes to get a 5 on the test. Everything in the AP and introductory college courses are covered, from Supply &amp; Demand, to Monopoly, Labor Supply, Competition, and Game Theory. Full length sample AP tests are also worked out, complete with free response questions. Professor Park received both his M.A. in Education and B.A. in Economics &amp; Government from Claremont McKenna College.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63ae9ba29c8152b8e56cd60aef0e9fa3bf27cf71","amp;dn":"Educator+-+AP+Microeconomics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63ae9ba29c8152b8e56cd60aef0e9fa3bf27cf71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,174,155,162,156,129,82,184,229,108,214,10,239,14,159,163,191,39,207,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
