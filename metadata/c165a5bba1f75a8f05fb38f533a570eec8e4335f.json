This book focuses on a few places that have become such a draw, almost as if the rocks and trees have demanded to be photographed.\nAs a third generation landscape photographer, Marc Muench has been fortunate to be one photographer that has lived the experience, explored the regions, lugged the large cameras, waited for the light, and, in a few cases, photographed a unique location for the first time. Marc discusses how landscape photography is more than simply an exploration of the landscape, but is also an exploration of your equipment and, ultimately, of yourself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c165a5bba1f75a8f05fb38f533a570eec8e4335f","amp;dn":"Exploring+North+American+Landscapes+%28Photography+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c165a5bba1f75a8f05fb38f533a570eec8e4335f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,101,165,187,161,247,90,143,5,251,56,245,51,165,112,238,200,228,51,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
