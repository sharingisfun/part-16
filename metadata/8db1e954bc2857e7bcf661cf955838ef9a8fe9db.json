Vanek and Louis D. Albright (McGraw-Hill, 2008).pdf\n\nISBN 0-07-164094-0\n\nA Unique Systems Approach to Energy Engineering, Covering Carbon-Based, Nuclear, and Renewable Sources!\n\nAn essential reference for all engineers and students working with energy systems, Energy Systems Engineering presents a systems approach to future energy needs, covering carbon-based, nuclear, and renewable energy sources. This unique guide explores the latest technology within each energy systems area, the benefits and liabilities of each, the challenges posed by changing energy supplies, the negative impacts from energy consumption, especially CO2 emissions, and the ways in which a portfolio of new technologies can address these problems.\n\nFilled with over 200 detailed illustrations and tables, the book examines short-, medium-, and long-term energy options for the remainder of the twenty-first century. For each energy system, the authors provide equations and problems to help practitioners quantify the performance of the technology and better understand its potential. Energy Systems Engineering features:\n\nA valuable systems approach to energy engineering\nCoverage of all major energy topics_from climate change to wind power\nBoth U.S. and global energy perspectives, with international comparisons\nEmphasis on CO2 issues and abatement, including carbon sequestration\nA wealth of equations and problems for each area of energy technology\nNumerous tables and graphs in PowerPoint format for easy presentation\nAn extensive online ancillary package for instructors provides an instructor's manual, solution files, course syllabus, Matlab scripts, and teaching PowerPoint files.\n\nInside This Cutting-Edge Guide to the Technology of Energy Systems:\n\nSystems Engineering and Economic Analysis Tools Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Climate Change Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Fossil Fuels, Relative CO2 Emissions, and Modeling of Consumption and Remaining Reserves Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Fossil Fuel Combustion Technologies Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Carbon Sequestration Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Nuclear Energy Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The Solar Energy Resource Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Solar Technology Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Wind Energy Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Energy Technologies for Transportation Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Systems Issues for Transportation Energy Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Other Emerging Renewable Energy Technologies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8db1e954bc2857e7bcf661cf955838ef9a8fe9db","amp;dn":"Energy+Systems+Engineering+-+Evaluation+and+Implementation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8db1e954bc2857e7bcf661cf955838ef9a8fe9db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,177,233,84,188,40,87,231,188,246,97,207,149,88,56,239,154,143,233,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
