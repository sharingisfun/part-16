We look like you. We talk like you. We live among you. But we are not you. We can do things you dream of doing. We have powers you dream of having. We are stronger and faster than anything you have ever seen. We are the superheroes you worship in movies and comic books - but we are real.\n\nOur plan was to grow, and train, and become strong, and become one, and fight them. But they found us and started hunting us first. Now all of us are running. Spending our lives in shadows, in places where no one would look, blending in. We have lived among you without you knowing.\n\nBut they know.\n\nThey caught Number One in Malaysia.\nNumber Two in England.\nAnd Number Three in Kenya.\nThey killed them all.\n\nI am Number Four.\n\nI am next.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e77d497442a9e1a728a0815b07219eb37e942a7","amp;dn":"I+Am+Number+Four+%28Audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e77d497442a9e1a728a0815b07219eb37e942a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,119,212,151,68,42,158,26,114,138,8,21,176,114,25,235,55,233,66,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
