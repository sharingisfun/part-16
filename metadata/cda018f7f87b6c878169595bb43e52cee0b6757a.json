JapanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s secret weapon, the KaitenÃ¢â‚¬â€a manned suicide submarineÃ¢â‚¬â€had succeeded in its first mission.\n\nThe Kaiten was so secret that even Japanese naval commanders didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know of its existence. And the Americans kept it secret as well. Embarrassed by the shocking surprise attack, the U.S. Navy refused to salvage or inspect the sunken Mighty Miss. Only decades later would the survivors understand what really happened at Ulithi, when a diving team located the wreck in 2001.\n\nIn Kaiten, Michael Mair and Joy Waldron tell the full story from both sides, from the strategic importance of the USS Mississinewa to newly revealed secrets of the Kaiten development and training schools. U.S. Navy survivors recount their gripping experiences in the wake of the attack, as well as the harrowing recovery efforts that came later. Japanese pilots reveal their terrifying experiences training to die for their country and Emperor, never knowing when their moment of doom would come","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cda018f7f87b6c878169595bb43e52cee0b6757a","amp;dn":"Kaiten%3A+Japan%27s+Secret+Manned+Suicide+Submarine+and+the+First+Am","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cda018f7f87b6c878169595bb43e52cee0b6757a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,160,24,247,248,123,108,135,129,105,89,91,180,62,82,206,224,182,117,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
