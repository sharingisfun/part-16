A little information about them: \n\nNirvana was an American rock band formed by singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic in Aberdeen, Washington in 1987. Nirvana went through a succession of drummers, the longest-lasting being Dave Grohl, who joined the band in 1990.\n\nIn the late 1980s Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first album Bleach for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. The band eventually came to develop a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to major label DGC Records, Nirvana found unexpected success with &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, the first single from the band's second album Nevermind (1991). Nirvana's sudden success widely popularized alternative rock as a whole, and the band's frontman Cobain found himself referred to in the media as the &quot;spokesman of a generation&quot;, with Nirvana being considered the &quot;flagship band&quot; of Generation X.[1] Nirvana's third studio album, In Utero (1993), featured an abrasive, less-mainstream sound and challenged the group's audience. The album did not match the sales figures of Nevermind but was still a critical and commercial success.\n\nNirvana's brief run ended following the death of Kurt Cobain in 1994, but various posthumous releases have been issued since, overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow Courtney Love. Since its debut, the band has sold over 25 million records in the United States alone, and over 80 million records worldwide.\n\nThis torrent has the following albums:\n\n-Bleach\n-In Utero\n-Incesticide\n-MTV Unplugged in New York\n-Nevermind\n\nAll the albums have their respectiv covers, the files are in mp3 format and in 320kbps. \nQuestions or requests for discographys/greatest hits put here: https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=154990\n\nPlease seed and enjoy the torrent! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc0fe291a13e6b1408030b9bf014d3401a1a2d38","amp;dn":"Nirvana+-+Studio+discography+%2B+MTV+Unplugged+in+New+York","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc0fe291a13e6b1408030b9bf014d3401a1a2d38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,15,226,145,161,62,107,20,8,3,11,155,240,20,211,64,26,26,45,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
