PHOTOSHOP TUTORiALS:                                       \n    Ever wish you had Photoshop skills? Well.. i do. How did i learn?      \n    I did tons and tons of 'Signature Tutorials'. I kept doing them.       \n    Not many people are aware of the sophistication those little 'Sigs'    \n    require and take to make. They are jam-packed with unknown, useful,    \n    exotic techniques, tips, and a well oiled work flow.                   \n                                                                           \n    What's great about these tutorials is they are picture illustrated.    \n    Authors take the time to show you step-by-step with 'Before' and       \n    'After' screenshots. These are great for beginners or enthusiasts who  \n    are looking to sharpen their skills.                              \n                                                                      \n    included are .... :                                               \n                                                                      \n    &gt;&gt; 22 'Sig' Tutorials                                             \n       [+] Abstract Smoking Girl Tutorial                             \n       [+] Ballers Tutorial                                           \n       [+] Bruce to the Lee Tutorial                                  \n       [+] Chaos Tutorial                                             \n       [+] Clipping Masks Tutorial                                    \n       [+] CobraGFX (Afro Samurai) Tutorial                           \n       [+] CobraGFX Tutorial                                          \n       [+] Creating Depth in your Signatures Tutorial                 \n       [+] DrifterGria Tutorial                                       \n       [+] Gryphon Tutorial                                           \n       [+] Jeza87 Tutorial                                            \n       [+] Keopard Tutorial                                           \n       [+] MPCoyote Tutorial                                          \n       [+] Reflections Tutorial                                       \n       [+] RudeBoySes Tutorial                                        \n       [+] Samma Tutorial                                             \n       [+] Senthrax Tutorial                                          \n       [+] SoSik Tutorial                                             \n       [+] VNT87 Tutorial                                             \n       [+] WarpZone116 Tutorial                                       \n       [+] xBeatx Tutorial                                            \n       [+] XiceGfx Tutorial                                           \n    &gt;&gt; 10 UFC PSD Source (great to see how sigs are made)             \n       [+] Alistair 'Demolition Man' Overeem                          \n       [+] Anderson 'The Spider' Silva                                \n       [+] Brock 'The Viking' Lesnar                                  \n       [+] Cain 'Brown Pride' Velasquez                               \n       [+] Chris 'Lights Out' Lytle                                   \n       [+] Fedor 'The Last Emperor' Emelianenko                       \n       [+] Georges 'Rush' St-Pierre                                   \n       [+] Lyoto 'The Dragon' Machida                                 \n       [+] Mauricio 'Shogun' Rua                                      \n       [+] Michael 'The Count' Bisping                                \n                                                                           \n    NOTE: These are handpicked tutorials that i find most useful, and      \n    show the most information with screenshot illustrations.               \n                                                                           \n----&gt;&gt; 2.

SUiTCASE FUSiON 3 (Font Manager):                                \n    You never want to install fonts directly onto your system. It will     \n    affect Photoshop, Illustrator, and the overall performance of your     \n    computer. This is why i use Suitcase among many other reasons !        \n                                                                           \n    Quick Highlights:                                                      \n    - Easy to install fonts: just locate the directory and Suitcase will   \n    search each folder/file, install fonts, while ignoring non-font files. \n    - Font Doctor: this will help repair corrupted fonts.                  \n    - Preview: you can see what the fonts look like.                       \n    - Auto-Activation: Suitcase will automatically activate fonts that     \n    are needed by your system.                                             \n    - Performance: this will greatly avoid performance problems for your   \n    PC.                                                                    \n    - Online Font Store: you can buy/rent fonts from the online store.     \n                                                                           \n    Take a look here for details:                                          \n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.extensis.com/en/products/suitcasefusion3/overview.jsp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.extensis.com/en/products/suitcasefusion3/overview.jsp&lt;/a&gt;       \n                                                                           \n    NOTE: I include activation instructions and the tools required.        \n                                                                           \n----&gt;&gt; 4.

PHOTOSHOP PLUGiNS:                                               \n    Plugins are vital for Graphics Designers. Plugins save designers tons  \n    of time. Essentially plugins are shortcuts that do a variety of        \n    Effects, Designs, and Enhancements that usually would take hours.      \n                                                                           \n    These are also handpicked from my collection that i use frequently.    \n                                                                           \n    Many people instal plugins just to install them. But too many plugins  \n    will cause Photoshop poor performance.
