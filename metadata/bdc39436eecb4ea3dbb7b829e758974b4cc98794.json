Since the PlayStation's analog controller was not available at the time, and analog control for Pole Position is only supported in this compilation by Namco's neGcon joypad.\n\nThe package also featured a &quot;museum&quot; mode where the player could walk through a virtual museum containing various curiosities surrounding the games including images of the mainboards, marketing material and conceptual artwork (all from the Japanese releases; neither this nor the others contain any American materials). For this reason, the games themselves are based on the Japanese releases, although for the U.S. the games retain their U.S. changes (i.e., Pac-Man is still &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Puckman&quot;; the ghosts still have their U.S. names, etc.).\n---------------------------------\n---------------------------------\n---------------------------------\n\nNAMCO MUSEUM VOL 2:\nThe second installment of the PlayStation series features Mappy (1983), Xevious (1982), Galaga sequel Gaplus (1984), Grobda (1984) (a Xevious &quot;spinoff&quot;), Dragon Buster (1984) and Super Pac-Man (1982) (in western versions), and Cutie Q (1979). Although Cutie Q is only playable in the Japanese version, its code can be found on the American release of this compilation. It enjoyed similar success to the original, and contained a similar &quot;museum&quot; mode. The Japanese version also features Bomb Bee (1979) as a hidden game. There is a glitch in this volume where in Dragon Buster the high score is not saved properly. It is shown in the record book, but does not appear in-game. The default hi-score is 10,000.\n---------------------------------\n---------------------------------\n---------------------------------\n\nNAMCO MUSEUM VOL 3:\nThe third PlayStation volume contains Galaxian (1979), Dig Dug (1982), Pac-Man sequel Ms. Pac-Man (1981), Pole Position II (1983), The Tower of Druaga (1984) and Phozon (1983). The first four were well-known in the U.S., but the latter two were relatively unknown. It contained the now-customary museum mode. Two unique versions of The Tower of Druaga were also hidden in this volume. One called &quot;Another Tower&quot;, and the other called &quot;Darkness Tower&quot;. Both are harder than the original and require different methods to beat the game.\n---------------------------------\n---------------------------------\n---------------------------------\n\nNAMCO MUSEUM VOL 4:\nVolume 4 for the PlayStation features Pac-Land (1984), Assault (1988), Ordyne (1988), the sequel to The Tower of Druaga known as The Return of Ishtar (1986) Genpei TÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ma Den (1986), and Assault Plus (1988) as a hidden game. The usual museum mode was included. Genpei TÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ma Den was renamed &quot;Genji and the Heike Clans&quot; in this collection.\n----------------------------------\n----------------------------------\n----------------------------------\n\nNAMCO MUSEUM VOL 5:\nVolume 5 for the PlayStation features Pac-Mania (1987), Dragon Spirit (1987), Metro-Cross (1985), Baraduke (1985) and Valkyrie No Densetsu (1989), as well as the standard museum mode. Valkyrie No Densetsu was renamed &quot;Legend of the Valkyrie&quot; in this collection.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHELP ME SEED MY LOW-SEEDED TORRENTS SO I CAN UPLOAD MORE AND NOT WORRY ABOUT THE OLD ONES!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDon't forget to snag a copy of my Land of the Dead torrent (you can play it online).\n\n\nI HAVE A FEW ONLINE PLAYABLE TORRENTS SO FAR:\nLand of the Dead\nPostal 1 and Postal 2 Share The Pain (All Mods)\nSniper Elite\nSerious Sam: The First and Second Encounter\nNexuiz\nDoom Collection (all the older doom games)  NOTE: This Requires a mod to play online (skulltag), it's free, google it\nOTHERS CAN MOST LIKELY BE PLAYED VIA HAMACHI\n\n\nDOWNLOAD ALL MY TORRENTS HERE:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdc39436eecb4ea3dbb7b829e758974b4cc98794","amp;dn":"Namco+Museum+Vol.+1-5+%28Full+PSX+Collection%29+%28PS1%29+%28ePSXe%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdc39436eecb4ea3dbb7b829e758974b4cc98794","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,195,148,54,238,203,78,163,219,183,184,41,231,88,151,75,76,201,135,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
