He is a lonely man, and his only friend is his former professor Sol Robeson (Mark Margolis). Max has the following assumptions, which rules his life: (1) Mathematics is the language of nature; (2) Everything around us can be represented and understood from numbers; (3) If you graph the numbers in any systems, patterns emerge. Therefore there are patterns everywhere in nature. Based on these principles, Max is trying to figure out a system to predict the behavior of the stock market. Due to his research, Max is chased by a Wall Street company with obvious interest in the results of his studies, and by an orthodox Jew follower of the Torah, who believes that this long string of numbers is a code sent from God.\n\nSource: NTSC DVD\nCodec: Xvid\nRes: 352x208\nAudio: mp3 stereo 128 kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfe0da5100e3f40334f45563edfbc2e2f3d9c35e","amp;dn":"Pi+%281998%29+DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfe0da5100e3f40334f45563edfbc2e2f3d9c35e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,224,218,81,0,227,244,3,52,244,85,99,237,251,194,226,243,217,195,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
