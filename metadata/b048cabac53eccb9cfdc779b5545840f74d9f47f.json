Even sad\nsongs sound happy when some people interpret them, like the singers who make\n`Black CoffeeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ sultry, and there are other musicians who only approach a song\nin a theoretical manner. I was aiming for what Billie Holiday could do, which\nwas to get to the emotions of each song.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Branford Marsalis, on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEternal.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\nIf the Marsalis Family of New Orleans had only one son to give to jazz, it would\nhave been enough. But each of four musical offspring of pianist Ellis Marsalis\n(Branford, Wynton, Delfeayo, and Jason) has found his place as a performer,\nrecording artist, educator, and producer. While trumpeter WyntonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leadership\nwith Jazz at Lincoln Center and profile in Ken BurnsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ documentary give him the\nmost visibility, eldest brother, saxophonist Branford, may prove to be the most\neclectic and creative Marsalis. Certainly his most recent recordings and\nproduction projects give ample evidence that there is far more to this musician\nthan film scores and Jay Leno arrangements, not the least of which is the\nGrammy-nominated Eternal (Marsalis Music, 2004).\n\nWith his working quartet (pianist Joey Calderazzo, bassist Eric Reavis, and\ndrummer Jeff ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Watts), Marsalis extends his reach into the realm of modern\nballadry, the result worthy of inclusion on anyoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBest of 2004ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nlist. Nominated for five Jazz Journalist Association awards as well as a Grammy,\nEternal ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcovers lots of ground stylistically, from near-retro sounds to more\nfloating, contemporary playing. It is always strong while conveying sensitivity\nand vulnerabilityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (Peter Hum, Ottawa Citizen).\n\nEternal opens with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRuby and the PearlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, a tune by Raymond Evans and Jay\nLivingston that Marsalis heard performed by Nat King Cole. As the opening track,\nthis reading sets the stage for a sensuous, restrained, and simply beautiful\nrecording, and singly may be one of the most gorgeous tunes for soprano sax in\nthe modern jazz canon. In his online liner notes, Rafi Zabor describes this\ntrack as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa suave, soignÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© boleroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½; indeed it feels like one should be slow\ndancing in the embrace of a passionate lover. Marked by percussive restraint by\nthe typically explosive Watts, Marsalis sends a final note lingering long on the\nair.\n\nThe drummer provides ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œReikaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Loss,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in which the soprano sax takes the melody\nover the counterpoint of bass and piano, in a Miles Davis-like celestial\nblend. Watts is all shimmer, while CalderazzoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s solo and improvisations take the\nmelody apart, yet preserve its overall beauty and solemnity. Popularized by\nBillie Holiday, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGloomy SundayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (aka the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsuicide songÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by Seress and Javor) is\naptly described by Zabor as a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œimpassioned, doomstruck recitativeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbluesy\nsubtextual implications,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½and Marsalis tenor solo indeed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œproceeds to quietly\ntear your heart out.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Watts offers a gentle storm warning in his opening mallet\nwork that slowly rises as the storm closes in. Marsalis conjures whiffs of Ben\nWebsterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ghost with a 21st century reed, and Calderazzo brings forth another\ngorgeous, minimalist solo. Zabor describes the pianistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Lonely SwanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa\nnouveau bossa;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ piano and soprano sax carry the melody line over the clicking\nand softly crashing efforts of Watts, while RevisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ provides effective ostinato\nfigures in the bassline. On Nat King ColeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDinner for One, Please James,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nMarsalis sings yet another gorgeous melody, this time on tenor, and a tenor\nworthy of the phrases and vibrato of another era. Watts provides some laid-back\nbrushwork, Calerazzo a lovely solo interlude, and Reavis maintains a steady,\nother-worldly pulse. ReavisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMuldoonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a tenor/piano duet, a tour de force\nfor Marsalis and Calderazzo.\n\nBut the showpiece is the title track, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEternal,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ MarsalisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ tribute to his wife\nNicole. tribute to his wife Nicole Zabor notes some initial hints of Coltrane,\nbut thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also a hymn-like melodicism reminiscent of recent works of Charles\nLloyd. Over 17 minutes, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEternalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ builds and builds in intensity, speed, and\npassion, reaching a climax at about 13 minutes, then returning to a quiet\nreflection, as if a great flood has been unleashed and now the waters recede;\ngreat sheets of shimmers from Watts accompanied by pounding mallets.\n\nNoted John Fordham (The Guardian), Eternal offers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œno fierce harangues or\nwayward Ornette Colemanisms, just plenty of romantic long-note caressing, soft\nLatin glides, cafe-music clinchesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Marsalis sharply reins in his ability to pack\na lot of saxophone activity into tight spaces. He concentrates instead on the\nshapeliness of the short, motif-like figures, the meticulous articulation of\nisolated sounds, and the melodic possibilities dictated by the tunes.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nMore information about Branford Marsalis and tour schedule is available at &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.branfordmarsalis.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.branfordmarsalis.com&lt;/a&gt; and http://www.marsalismusic.com\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEn castellano:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b048cabac53eccb9cfdc779b5545840f74d9f47f","amp;dn":"Branford+Marsalis+Quartet+-+Eternal+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b048cabac53eccb9cfdc779b5545840f74d9f47f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,72,202,186,197,62,204,185,207,220,119,155,85,69,132,15,116,217,244,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
