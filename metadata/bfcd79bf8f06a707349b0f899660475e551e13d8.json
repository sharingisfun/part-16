She went on to duet with him on his much anticipated Comes a Time album, which was the genesis for Nicolette. Using an even wider-ranging style than friends Linda Ronstadt or Emmylou Harris, Larson hit it big right out of the starting gate with Young&amp;#039;s &quot;Lotta Love,&quot; a super Top Ten smash. From there, she broadens her approach to include a soulful &quot;You Send Me,&quot; the Louvin Bros&amp;#039; &quot;Angels Rejoiced,&quot; Motown&amp;#039;s &quot;Baby, Don&amp;#039;t Do It,&quot; and a hard-rockin&amp;#039; &quot;Can&amp;#039;t Get Away From You.&quot; No matter which genre she aspired to, she seemed to have the chops to do a fine job. Nicolette was a surprise for many when it first came out and is still a pleasure to listen to today. After this, her first effort, the sky was the limit for Larson.\n\nInformation Disc:\n\n?
