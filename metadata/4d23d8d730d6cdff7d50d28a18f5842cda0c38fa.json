What can you say? You're a police detective, but maybe you're just not good enough and that's what you have to admit, whether you like it or not. You see evidence of things that can't be real, but you just don't observe well enough to explain it in any natural way. Can you ask rational questions and still be crazy? Does it help any that you know your mind is gone? You're trapped in a black comedy with a beautiful but fatal woman right out of an old poem by Keats, hoping to wake up from the nightmare, even if on a cold hillside - as long as you wake up sane.\n\nDetective William Benek is faced with an impossible crime; bodies are turning up without their brains, and without any indication of how the organs were removed. His only lead - an attractive woman - becomes more than a lead, and then drives him into a world of terror, where his sanity is questioned and he must stop a monster he can barely comprehend.\n\nListed as a Best Book of 2009 by EDGE/Boston\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d23d8d730d6cdff7d50d28a18f5842cda0c38fa","amp;dn":"Empties+%28George+Zebrowski%29+Retail+azw3+epub+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d23d8d730d6cdff7d50d28a18f5842cda0c38fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,35,216,215,48,214,205,255,125,80,210,138,24,245,132,44,218,12,56,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
