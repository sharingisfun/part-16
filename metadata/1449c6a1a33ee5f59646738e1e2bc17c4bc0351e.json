As he approached his 60th year, he was becoming more famous as a charismatic contrabasso profundo vocalist than as an archetypal jazz man whose style and persona shaped the course of jazz and popular music throughout the first half of the 20th century. Released in 1994, volume one in the Verve Jazz Masters reissue series contains 15 examples of Louis Armstrong at his warmest and most accessible. The more intimate material was drawn from his collaborations with pianist Oscar Peterson and Ella Fitzgerald; other selections find him singing in reverb backed by a polished, sometimes string-laden orchestra arranged and conducted by Russell Garcia. As if to reconnect with the essence of his original role in the development of classic jazz, Armstrong &amp; His All Stars close the set with the old Dixieland war horse &quot;When the Saints Go Marching In.&quot; This little Satchmo sampler is a serviceable introduction to the mature Louis Armstrong that will ensure ready access to a leisurely, nearly nine-minute rendering of Cole Porter's &quot;Let's Do It (Let's Fall in Love).&quot; ~ arwulf arwulf, All Music Guide\n\nEven more than 30 years after his death, Louis Armstrong's accomplishments and influence are felt strongly in jazz and popular music. Among the first major soloists, Armstrong's relaxed legato phrasing, brilliant ideas and use of space to dramatic effect changed the way that jazz is played. As a singer, Armstrong transferred his innovations from the trumpet to his gravelly voice and helped popularize scat singing. And as a personality, Satch was jazz's greatest goodwill ambassador. Even in the 21st century, he remains the most famous and beloved of all jazz musicians.\n\nIn the 1950s, Armstrong recorded for the Verve label in a wide variety of settings apart from his usual performances with his All-Stars. Jazz Masters puts the focus on Satch's singing (although there are some concise trumpet solos), alternating between his recordings with the Oscar Peterson Quartet and dates on which he is accompanied by Russell Garcia's string orchestra; Ella Fitzgerald makes a guest appearance on Learnin' The Blues. Armstrong swings such numbers as Just One Of Those Things, Let's Do It, You're The Top, A Fine Romance and a touching version of Home, showing what a talented and underrated interpreter of lyrics he was during the era. This well-rounded set concludes with Armstrong and his All-Stars playing a spirited version of When The Saints Go Marchin' In. ~ Scott Yanow\n\nPersonnel:\nLouis Armstrong, Vocals/Trumpet;\nOscar Peterson, Piano;\nHerb Ellis, Guitar;\nLouis Bellson, Drums;\nRay Brown, Bass;\nElla Fitzgerald, Vocals\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 01 - Louis Armstrong Tracks:\n01  Just One of Those Things 4:02 \n02  That Old Feeling 2:43 \n03  I Gotta Right to Sing the Blues 3:55 \n04  Learnin' the Blues 7:12 \n05  Let's Do It (Let's Fall in Love) 8:43 \n06  There's a Boat Dat's Leavin' Soon for New York 4:49 \n07  Blues in the Night 5:11 \n08  You're the Top 2:29 \n09  Body and Soul 4:41 \n10  When Your Lover Has Gone 4:39 \n11  Fine Romance 3:51 \n12  Home (When Shadows Fall) 5:47 \n13  I've Got the World on a String 2:49 \n14  I Was Doing All Right 3:20 \n15  When the Saints Go Marching In 5:54 \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1449c6a1a33ee5f59646738e1e2bc17c4bc0351e","amp;dn":"Verve+Jazz+Masters+01+-+Louis+Armstrong+%281994%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+192%5D%5Bh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1449c6a1a33ee5f59646738e1e2bc17c4bc0351e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,73,198,161,163,62,229,245,150,70,115,142,30,43,193,124,75,192,53,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
