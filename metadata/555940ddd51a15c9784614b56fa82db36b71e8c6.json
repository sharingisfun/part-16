Brazen with youth and stoned out of their gourds, they thought they had the perfect plan for getting away with it. They were wrong.\n\nTwenty-five years later, JonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s marriage is on the rocks, his kids are virtual strangers, and the recession has taken his job and decimated his finances. Worst of all, when he finds Augie murdered in Vegas, he knows the past has risen from its grave to grab him by the throat.\n\nThe battle that ensues will send Jon skittering across a landscape wracked by the Great Recession to confront the demons of his past: the grade-school bully who has terrorized him for decades, the grandfather that betrayed him, the girl that got away. And in the middle of a fight to death, with his daughterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life hanging in the balance, Jon Willing learns the most brutal of truths: The piper always gets paid, and sometimes he gets paid in blood.\n\nGenre: Mystery/Thriller","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:555940ddd51a15c9784614b56fa82db36b71e8c6","amp;dn":"The+Accounting+by+William+Lashner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"555940ddd51a15c9784614b56fa82db36b71e8c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,89,64,221,213,26,21,201,120,70,20,181,111,168,45,179,107,113,232,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
