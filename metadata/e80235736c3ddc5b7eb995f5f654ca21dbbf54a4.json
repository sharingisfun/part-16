After the parties have ended, though, Brazilians start playing the softer, more introspective music for which they are also renowned. Just as the Brazilian carnival season is winding down, Putumayo presents Acoustic Brazil. While upbeat rhythms like samba, forrÃƒÂ³ and axÃƒÂ© have people dancing in the streets during carnival, Acoustic Brazil focuses on the more delicate Brazilian music that comes to life in the aftermath of the party. \nAs the birthplace of Antonio Carlos Jobim and other masterful songwriters, Brazil has given the world some of its most entrancing melodies. Acoustic Brazil includes songs performed or written by some of these great figures, as well as others from the emerging young voices of popular Brazilian music. Legends such as Caetano Veloso, Chico Buarque, Gal Costa and Paulinho da Viola are featured here alongside a new generation of singers who demonstrate the beauty of Brazil?s acoustic music traditions. \nAcoustic Brazil is the latest addition to Putumayo?s popular series of Brazilian CDs (Brasileiro, Samba Bossa Nova and Brazilian Groove), which have sold half a million copies combined. From the gentle swing of bossa nova and samba canÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o, to the lyrical grace of contemporary singer-songwriters, Acoustic Brazil presents some of the most beautiful songs from Brazil?s unique musical legacy. \n\nTracklist:\nGal Costa - Aquele Frevo Axe \nPaulinho da Viola - A Voz do Povo \nAna de Hollanda - Samba Triste \nMarcio Faraco - Ciranda \nTeresa Cristina - Meu Mundo e Hoje (Eu Sou Assim) \nChico Buarque - Quando Eu For Eu Vou Sem Pena \nRita Ribeiro - Tem Quem Queira \nCaetano Veloso - Cajuina \nMonica Salmaso - Moro Na Roca \nLucas Santtana - Mensagem de Amor \nGlaucia Nasser - Labios de Cetim \nLula Queiroga - Noite Severina \n\n\n\nThis is one of the many PutumayoÃ‚Â´s records I have in mind to upload, so please help keep seeding after you downloaded.\nEnjoy It!\nUlysses56\n\n\nFor more info: http://www.putumayo.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e80235736c3ddc5b7eb995f5f654ca21dbbf54a4","amp;dn":"Putumayo+Presents-Acoustic+Brazil+By+Ulysses56","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e80235736c3ddc5b7eb995f5f654ca21dbbf54a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,2,53,115,108,61,220,91,126,185,149,245,246,84,202,33,219,191,84,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
