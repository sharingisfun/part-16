June 21, 1954, Los Angeles; keyboards, vocals), Steve Lukather (b. October 21, 1957, Los Angeles; guitar, vocals), Bobby Kimball (b. Robert Toteaux, March 29, 1947, Vinton, LA; vocals), Steve Porcaro (b. September 2, 1957, Connecticut; keyboards), David Hungate (b. Texas; bass), and Jeff Porcaro (b. April 1, 1954, Hartford, CT; d. August 5, 1992, Hidden Hills, CA; drums). Paich was the son of arranger Marty Paich; the Porcaros were the sons of percussionist Joe Porcaro. The bandmembers had met in high school and at studio sessions in the 1970s, when they became some of the busiest session musicians in the music business. Paich, Hungate, and Jeff Porcaro wrote songs for and performed on Silk Degrees, the multi-million-selling 1976 album that combined pop, rock, and disco elements into a slick combination which heavily influenced mainstream pop music.\n\nToto released its self-titled debut album in October 1978, and it hit the Top Ten, sold two-million copies, and spawned the gold Top Ten single &quot;Hold the Line.&quot; The gold-selling Hydra (October 1979) and Turn Back (January 1981) were less successful, but Toto IV (April 1982) was a multi-platinum Top Ten hit, featuring the number-one hit &quot;Africa&quot; and the Top Tens &quot;Rosanna&quot; (about Lukather&amp;#039;s girlfriend, movie star Rosanna Arquette) and &quot;I Won&amp;#039;t Hold You Back.&quot; At the 1982 Grammys, &quot;Rosanna&quot; won awards for Record of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Performance, and Best Instrumental Arrangement With Vocal; and Toto IV won awards for Album of the Year, Best Engineered Recording, and Best Producer (the group). In 1984, a third Porcaro brother, Mike (b. May 29, 1955), joined the group on bass, replacing Hungate. Then lead singer Kimball quit and was replaced by Dennis &quot;Fergie&quot; Frederiksen (b. May 15, 1951, Wyoming, MI).\n\nToto&amp;#039;s fifth album, Isolation (November 1984), went gold, but was a commercial disappointment. Frederiksen was replaced by Joseph Williams (b. Santa Monica), the son of the conductor/composer John Williams, for Fahrenheit (August 1986). Steve Porcaro quit in 1988, prior to the release of The Seventh One. In 1990, Jean-Michel Byron replaced Williams for the new recordings on Past to Present 1977-1990, then left, as Lukather became the group&amp;#039;s lead singer. Jeff Porcaro died of a heart attack in 1992, but was featured on the group&amp;#039;s next album, Kingdom of Desire. By this time, Toto was far more popular in Japan and Europe than at home. The group added British drummer Simon Phillips. Tambu, released in Europe in the late fall of 1995, appeared in the U.S. in June 1996. For 1999&amp;#039;s Mindfields, Bobby Kimball returned to the lineup after a 15-year absence. The group members continued to do session work during the band&amp;#039;s tenure, contributing significantly to the sound of mainstream pop/rock in the 1970s, &amp;#039;80s, and &amp;#039;90s.\n\n\n\n\n\nCD Pressing Information\n\n\n\nLabel: Polydor\nCatalog#: 823 770-2\nFormat: CD, Album\nCountry: Europe\nReleased: 1984\nGenre: Electronic, Stage &amp; Screen\nStyle: Soundtrack, Modern Classical, Ambient\n\n\n\n\nCredits\n\n\n\nAdapted By, Music By [Additional], Conductor - Marty Paich\nBass [Electric, Acoustic], Percussion - Mike Porcaro\nChoir - Vienna Volksoper Choir, The\nDrums, Percussion - Jeff Porcaro\nEngineer - Al Schmitt , Geoff Workman , Shep Lonsdale ,\nTom Fletcher , Tom Knox\nEngineer [Orchestra] - Franz Pusch , Oswald Gritch\nEngineer [Second, Sunset Sound] - Bill Jackson , Brent Averill\nExecutive Producer [Soundtrack] - Gilbert Marouani\nGuitar - Steve Lukather\nKeyboards - David Paich , Steve Porcaro\nOrchestra - Vienna Symphony Orchestra, The\nOrchestrated By [Additional Orchestration], Conductor - Allyn Ferguson\nPercussion - Robert Zimmitti* , Emil Richards , Joe Porcaro\nWritten-By, Composed By, Performer, Producer - Toto (tracks: 1 to 8, 10 to 17)\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nOriginal motion picture soundtrack from &quot;Dune&quot;, a David Lynch movie.\nStudios: The Villa, Sunset Sound &amp; The Manor.\nMastered by: The Mastering Lab.\nOrchestra recorded at: Austrophon Studio, Vienna, Austria.\nToto appears courtesy of Columbia Records.\nBrian Eno appears courtesy of EG Records, Ltd. and Opal Ltd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDune album review from allmusic.com\n\n\nReview by Dean Carlson\n\nDune was never going to be an easy film to score. Dense, overreaching, and confusing, David Lynch&amp;#039;s interpretation of the canon of Frank Herbert surely didn&amp;#039;t leave many stylistic decisions strolling in through the front door. Yet despite the soft rock pabulum of its past, Toto constructed a luxuriant and peculiar soundtrack that injects Dune with a barren majesty the film often failed to create on its own. The Vienna Symphony Orchestra lends these peculiar compositions a much-needed precision. Brian Eno helps out with the haunting synth hymns of &quot;Prophecy Theme.&quot; Remarkably, Dune is perhaps the only Lynch film where one could not wish the discovery of Angelo Badalamenti to have come sooner. Equally prescient horror and throwback to Hollywood epics of old -- there is nothing else to imagine but the organic, spiritual futurism of the film itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack List\n\n\n\nDune - OST (Toto + Brian Eno) (1984)\n\n01.
