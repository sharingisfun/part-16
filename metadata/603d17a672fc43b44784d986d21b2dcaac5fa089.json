He left an astonishing abundance of notes on these fields of knowledge and his early work shows that he was very educated and well read. His later works are closely connected to his studies and his profession. Novalis collected everything that he had learned, reflected upon it and drew connections in the sense of an encyclopaedic overview on art, religion and science. These notes from the years 1798 and 1799 are called Das allgemeine Brouillon, and are now available in English under the title Notes for a Romantic Encyclopaedia. Together with Friedrich Schlegel, Novalis developed the fragment as a literary form of art. The core of HardenbergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s literary works is the quest for the connection of science and poetry, and the result was supposed to be a &quot;progressive universal poesyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (fragment no. 116 of the Athenaum journal). Novalis was convinced that philosophy and the higher-ranking poetry have to be continually related to each other.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains following books, and all are in PDF format:\n\n* Fichte Studies - Edited by Jane Kneller (Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy, 2003)\n\n* Hymns to the Night - Translated by Dick Higgins (English and German Edition, 1988)\n\n* Notes for a Romantic Encyclopaedia - Translated, Edited,and with an Introduction by David W.
