He was the author of the classic novel Malice Aforethought, in which the identity of the murderer is revealed in the opening paragraph, though this is an equally unusual piece.\n\nJohnny Aysgarth is a bounder. Married to the wealthy Lena, they outwardly lead the life of a 1930s upper middle class couple. In reality, Johnny is a cheat who is deeply in debt to the bookmakers. Would such a man be capable of murder?\n\nThe play has a tragic and wholly unexpected ending, which is reflected in its title. Highly recommended.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2464e17b248e9b808962503aed4df34a80c1593c","amp;dn":"Before+The+Fact+-+BBC+Radio+Crime+Drama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2464e17b248e9b808962503aed4df34a80c1593c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,100,225,123,36,142,155,128,137,98,80,58,237,77,243,74,128,193,89,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
