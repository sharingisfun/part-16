D. Fortune, and the release of &quot;Pretty Vegas&quot; and &quot;Afterglow&quot; as singles, and its album Switch.[7][6][8]\n\nINXS has won six Australian Recording Industry Association awards including three for 'Best Group' in 1987, 1989 and 1992[9], and was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2001.[10][11] To date INXS have sold more than 30 million records.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c2e067ea6a9f4f27f26fbbd61f694e9ab38fbe6","amp;dn":"INXS+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c2e067ea6a9f4f27f26fbbd61f694e9ab38fbe6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,46,6,126,166,169,244,242,127,38,251,189,97,246,148,233,171,56,251,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
