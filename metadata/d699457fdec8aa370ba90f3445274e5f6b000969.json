I don't have hundreds of dollars to dish out on ebooks to &quot;rent them&quot;, and I certainly don't have the money to purchase a textbook when each textbook runs up 100+ dollars a piece!  Textbook companies rearrange their text and chapters, and change some of the problems, to make more money on essentially the same book with a new look to it.  \n\nThis is my way of saying Free Education for all! Stick it to the man! Download the .txt file... I promise: NO surveys, NO bullshit.  Here is my &quot;Coursesmart Solution&quot;!\n\nI encourage you to spread the books you acquire to other students (free of charge of course)!\n\nPlease leave a comment below with feedback... if you have a better way of doing this, let me know! If you think it's bullshit, and that I'm encouraging thievery, so be it... Don't bother if you don't like it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d699457fdec8aa370ba90f3445274e5f6b000969","amp;dn":"Free+coursesmart+ebooks+-+Interested%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d699457fdec8aa370ba90f3445274e5f6b000969","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,153,69,127,222,200,170,55,11,169,15,52,69,39,78,95,107,0,9,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
