It was recorded at Sunrise Studio in Kirchberg, Switzerland in February and August 1979, and released on LP in January 1980 on founding member Marc Hollander's Belgian independent record label, Crammed Discs. At the time the band had changed the spelling of their name to &quot;Aqsak Maboul&quot;, and this is reflected on the album's record sleeve. When the album was re-issued on CD in 1995 (also on Crammed Discs) the spelling of their name reverted back to &quot;Aksak Maboul&quot;.\n\nIn addition to the Aksak Maboul line-up at the time, the album also featured ex-Henry Cow musicians Fred Frith and Chris Cutler whose contribution and names helped bring the album to the attention of a wider audience.[1][2] Aksak Maboul's co-founder, Vincent Kenis did not play on this album, although he did arrange two of the tracks.\n\n\n\nSide A\n&quot;A Modern Lesson [Bo Diddley]&quot; (Hollander, arr.
