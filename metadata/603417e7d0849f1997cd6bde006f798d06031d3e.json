It's the Hair Bear Bunch! is a Saturday morning cartoon, produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions in 1971 for CBS.[1]\n\nThe series depicted three fun-loving bears Ã¢â‚¬â€ the Afroed, fast-talking Hair Bear (voiced by Daws Butler), confusing-talking Bubi Bear (voiced by Paul Winchell), and laid-back Square Bear (voiced by William Callaway) Ã¢â‚¬â€ who are always trying to find a way to escape the Wonderland Zoo on some sort of get-rich-quick scheme, or a wild night of fun.\nTrying to stop them are the constantly aggravated head zoo director, Mr. Eustace P. Peevly (voiced by John Stephenson), and his hopelessly inadequate assistant Lionel J. Botch (voiced by Joe E. Ross). Other residents of the Wonderland Zoo who help the Hair Bear Bunch in their plots include Bananas the Gorilla (voiced by Daws Butler), Furface the Lion (voiced by Paul Winchell), Bumbo the Elephant (voiced by Daws Butler), Slicks the Fox (voiced by John Stephenson), Hippy the Hippopotamus (voiced by John Stephenson), Hercules the Hippopotamus (voiced by Don Messick), George the Giraffe, Beaks the Pelican, Tiptoes the Ostrich (voiced by Paul Winchell), Gabby the Parrot, Melvyn the Monkey, Hoppy the Kangaroo, Zeed the Zebra, Ollie the Octopus, Einstein the Owl, Arnie and Gloria the Gorillas, Specs the Mole (voiced by Paul Winchell), and Pipsqueak the Mouse (voiced by both Janet Waldo in &quot;Love Bug Bungle&quot; and Paul Winchell in &quot;Bridal boo Boo&quot;)\nMr. Peevly and Botch work for the Zoo Superintendent (voiced by John Stephenson) as both of them try to stay on his good side even when it comes to Hair Bear's shenanigans which Hair Bear would cover up by stating that Peevly is doing some around the zoo activity with them. The bears have a modern &quot;bachelor pad&quot;-styled den at the zoo containing actual beds, Bubi's laboratory, a moving chair, a television, refrigerators, and a pizza maker. Yet they disguise it from Peevly and Botch to avoid revealing their comfortable surroundings.\nThe bears also have an invisible motorcycle, which Square Bear can call upon when necessary by jumping in the air and kicking his leg to start it. The motorcycle is never explained, though in episode twelve, Hair Bear comments: &quot;I don't know what he does, but I'm sure glad he does it.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:603417e7d0849f1997cd6bde006f798d06031d3e","amp;dn":"Help%21...+It%27s+the+Hair+Bear+Bunch+S01e01+%5BH264+-+Eng+Aac+-+Ita+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"603417e7d0849f1997cd6bde006f798d06031d3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,52,23,231,208,132,159,25,151,205,107,222,0,111,121,141,6,3,29,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
