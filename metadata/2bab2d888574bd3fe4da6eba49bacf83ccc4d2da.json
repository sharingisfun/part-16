(formerly General Motors Diesel) of London, Ontario. A total of 123 were constructed between May 1975 and December 1980. The major difference between the SD40-2W and a regular SD40-2 is the fitment of a wide-nose Canadian comfort cab, denoted by the W in the model name. \n\nThe Canadian comfort cab or wide cab is a broad-nosed cab design found on several diesel locomotive types. It occupies the entire width of the locomotive, and typically has an access door on the front. Otherwise, the locomotive is similar to other types of SD40-2. The Wide Nose for Train Simulator allows you to run authentic-looking Canadian freight trains and comes complete with freight cars. \n\nIncludes\n\n- SD40-2W Wide Nose in Canadian National livery \n- 89Ft Flatcar \n- 4 Chute Covered Hopper \n- Centre Beam Flatcar \n\n\n\nPlease support the developers and buy some of their content if you can afford it.\n\n\nJoin Railworks Central for more addons, support and discussions at:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.railworkscentral.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.railworkscentral.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor support and requests email:\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e89c8d89859c988adc8d9e8d9aa88f85898184c68b8785&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nIf you want to say thanks, contribute and share an addon with the community then email them to us...
