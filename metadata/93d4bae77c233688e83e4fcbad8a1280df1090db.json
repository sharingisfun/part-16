Nana and Ren have lived together as lovers since she was 16. When Ren is offered a chance to debut in Tokyo as a replacement member of the popular band, Trapnest (Toranesu in Japanese), Nana chooses to continue on with BLAST and to cultivate her own career instead of following Ren, as she has too much ambition to simply be a rockstar's girlfriend. She eventually leaves for Tokyo at the age of twenty to start her musical career.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://imageshack.us/a/img577/7996/oehzg72.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://imageshack.us/a/img577/7996/oehzg72.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nwe are on FaceBook, Post Your Request, suggestion, and find upcomming Release of Silver RG, you will find all Silver RG Encoders at FB Page so keep in touch\n\n \n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders,AliBaloch, AllEncoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers - Contact Us @\n\n:Support:\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say &quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93d4bae77c233688e83e4fcbad8a1280df1090db","amp;dn":"NANA+English+Dubbed+1-47+Complete+Episodes+x264+AC3+sum1_here+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93d4bae77c233688e83e4fcbad8a1280df1090db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,212,186,231,124,35,54,136,232,62,79,203,173,138,18,128,223,16,144,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
