A demo was recorded, but after a year they decided to change the name of the band because there were so many other bands around at the time with the same name. Under the new name Genghis Khan They released the self financed, now legendary double 7 inch &amp;#039;Double Dealin&amp;#039; . They changed the name of the band the same year to Tokyo Blade after they were contacted by another band who claimed to own the rights to the Genghis Khan name. Soon after, John Wiggins (ex Deep Machine  &amp; Lonewolf) was brought in to replace Ray.
