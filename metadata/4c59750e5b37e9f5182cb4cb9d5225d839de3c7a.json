Downes proposed a repertoire that would range from traditional Celtic tunes to modern songs.\n\nOver the years, some of the group's members have changed; in 2009, the group consisted of ChloÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â« Agnew, Lynn Hilary, Lisa Kelly, Alex Sharpe and fiddler MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡irÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ad Nesbitt'; Alex Sharpe left the group in May 2010.[6] Five albums have been released under the name &quot;Celtic Woman&quot;: Celtic Woman, Celtic Woman: A Christmas Celebration, Celtic Woman: A New Journey, Celtic Woman: The Greatest Journey, and Celtic Woman: Songs from the Heart. The group has undertaken a number of world tours. Cumulatively, albums by Celtic Woman have sold over 5 million records worldwide [7]\n\nThe foundation for Celtic music's popularity outside Ireland and Europe was built by tapping into the success of artists such as Enya and Clannad, along with stage shows Riverdance and Lord of the Dance. Celtic Woman has been described as being &quot;Riverdance for the voice.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c59750e5b37e9f5182cb4cb9d5225d839de3c7a","amp;dn":"Celtic+Woman+-+8+cd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c59750e5b37e9f5182cb4cb9d5225d839de3c7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,89,117,14,91,55,233,245,24,44,180,203,157,82,37,216,57,222,60,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
