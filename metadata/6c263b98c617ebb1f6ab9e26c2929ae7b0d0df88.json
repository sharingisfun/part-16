But if chasing down bail jumpers, adulterous spouses, and workmenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comp cases seemed like the dregs of the PI game, it was at least a living. Not as much could be said for tracking down a man like Will Ã¢â‚¬Å“the GhostÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Stirman.\n\nThe stone-cold killer has just staged a bloody escape from the Floresville State Penitentiary with a gang of violent cons as spooked by Stirman as those on the outside who helped put him behind bars. And no one seems more worried than NavarreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s boss and mentor, Erainya Manos. It was her husband along with rival PI Sam Barrera who built the case that sent Stirman away. But ErainyaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s husband is dead and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s certain Stirman wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let that stand in the way of his taking revenge against her and her adopted son.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c263b98c617ebb1f6ab9e26c2929ae7b0d0df88","amp;dn":"Rick+Riordan-Southtown","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c263b98c617ebb1f6ab9e26c2929ae7b0d0df88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,38,59,152,198,23,235,177,246,171,158,38,194,146,154,231,176,208,223,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
