His sisters carried on the fight without him until the end of the war. AndrÃƒÂ© survived three concentration camps and later became a prominent French politician who devoted the rest of his life to reconciliation of France and Germany. His parents and oldest brother were arrested and shipped off on the last train from Paris to Germany before the liberation, and died in the camps. Since then, silence has been the BoullochesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s answer to dealing with the unbearable. This is the first time the family has cooperated with an author to recount their extraordinary ordeal.\n\n\n\n     h el            ii                    a       r u   y yu  raii     l       eh","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:297cd74f5009a2dde42447332103f86de8521b68","amp;dn":"The+Cost+of+Courage+Charles+Kaiser+ebook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"297cd74f5009a2dde42447332103f86de8521b68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,124,215,79,80,9,162,221,228,36,71,51,33,3,248,109,232,82,27,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
