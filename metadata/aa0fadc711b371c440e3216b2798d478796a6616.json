Unless you have perfect pitch then you also need a piano or a guitar handy to check out which note is which. \n\nHowever, if you copy the recording to your computer\\\\\\'s hard disk as a sound file then you can use Transcribe! instead of the cassette machine and the piano. Transcribe! offers many features aimed at making the transcription job smoother and easier, including the ability to slow down music without changing its pitch, and to analyse chords and show you what notes are present.\n\nIt is important to understand that Transcribe! does not attempt to do the whole job, processing an audio file and outputting musical notation - this would be nice, but is a currently unsolved research problem. \n\nThe spectrum analysis feature is very useful for working out those hard-to-hear chords, but you must still use your ear and brain to decide which of the peaks in the spectrum are notes being played, which are merely harmonics, and which are just the result of noise and broad-spectrum instruments such as drums. \n\nIf you have never worked out even a simple piece of music by ear then Transcribe! will probably not help you (see How to Transcribe), but if you do sometimes work out recorded music by ear then Transcribe! can make the job a lot quicker and easier.\n\nTranscribe! takes no interest in MIDI files - these already contain explicit information about what notes are to be played and when, and there are plenty of programs available which can display this information. Transcribe! deals with audio sample data files.\n\nTranscribe! plays and records audio files but it is not an audio editor. It is capable of applying various effects to audio such as speed change, pitch change and EQ. You can save the modified audio to a new sound file if you want.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUploader comments: the program is an older version of Transcribe. No sn. Simply install and enjoy. You may have to restrict the program to connect to the internet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa0fadc711b371c440e3216b2798d478796a6616","amp;dn":"Transcribe+6.00","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa0fadc711b371c440e3216b2798d478796a6616","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,15,173,199,17,179,113,196,64,227,33,107,39,152,212,120,121,106,102,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
