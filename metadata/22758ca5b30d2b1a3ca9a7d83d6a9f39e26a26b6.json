The most common use in photography is to enhance lights such as lamps, streetlights, sky elements, or candle flames. However, many designers also use Light Factory to create sparkling or glowing lights from scratch. Light Factory was originally written by John Knoll, the co-creator of Photoshop, to create the Photon Torpedoes in Star Trek First Contact.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCustomers are always looking for new creative opportunities,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ said Jim Tierney, president of Digital Anarchy. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKnoll Light Factory offers a great way of painting with light, when you need to add some flare and sparkle to an image. Improving and speeding up the workflow was a major emphasis for this release, as photographers donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to spend lots of time at the computer.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nInside Light Factory, a user can choose from 19 different flare elements, then layer those elements to create the desired light effect. Almost any real life camera lens can be matched, or the Photoshop filter can generate completely original settings, and save out a preset for later use. Powerful functions include the ability to obscure the light with a grayscale mask; a real-time interactive preview; and 16-bit support for smoother glows and gradients.\n\nVersion 3.0 introduces a complete redesign of the user interface, with a simplified layout, new functions, a quick Preview Window, and preview thumbnails for light presets. The Light Editor has been integrated into a single interface that can be moved and resized to the userÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s workspace. An additional 50 light presets give users additional pre-made effects that range from naturalistic to dramatic.\n\nSome of the exciting features in Knoll Spark Pack 3.0 include:\nNew User Interface: The UI has been redesigned for ease of use, including previews of light presets and access to editing functions in one window.\nReal-Time Preview: The main Preview Window now supports real-time manipulation, as well as the ability to resize and zoom in/out.\n100+ Light Presets: There are now well over 100 great places to start when looking for that special flare.\n16-bit Color Support: Light effects now render out to higher bit depths, which reduces banding and outputs better looking glows and gradients.\nMac Intel and 64-bit Windows compatible: Full support of all of the new operating systems and religious preferences.\nObscuration Layer: Use a grayscale mask to partially obscure the lights, and make more realistic effects when lights are being partially blocked by an object.\nTint Layer: Use a separate layer to change the flare color for easier compositing on complex images.\nRandomize Feature: A Randomize button and slider let users organically discover fun new effects.\nUndo Functionality: Multi-level undo allows for an improved workflow when designing lights.\n\nCrack for 64 and 86 is included\n\nEnjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22758ca5b30d2b1a3ca9a7d83d6a9f39e26a26b6","amp;dn":"Knoll+Light+Factory+3.02+for+Adobe+Photoshop+CS4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22758ca5b30d2b1a3ca9a7d83d6a9f39e26a26b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,117,140,165,179,13,43,26,60,169,167,216,61,106,159,57,226,106,38,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
