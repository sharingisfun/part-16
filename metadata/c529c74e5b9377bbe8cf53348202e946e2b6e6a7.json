Innovations such as autoclaved aerated concrete masonry (AAC) are also discussed. Real-world case studies featuring a low-rise building with reinforced concrete masonry and a four-story building with clay masonry illustrate the techniques presented in this comprehensive resource.\n\nCoverage includes:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Basic structural behavior and design of low-rise, bearing wall buildings\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Materials used in masonry construction\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Code basis for structural design of masonry buildings, including seismic design\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Introduction of MSJC treatment of structural design\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Strength design of reinforced and unreinforced masonry elements\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Allowable-stress design of reinforced and unreinforced masonry elements\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Comparison of design by the allowable-stress approach versus the strength approach\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Lateral load analysis of shear wall structure\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Design and detailing of floor and roof diaphragms ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c529c74e5b9377bbe8cf53348202e946e2b6e6a7","amp;dn":"Masonry+Structural+Design+%282010%29+-+%28Malesrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c529c74e5b9377bbe8cf53348202e946e2b6e6a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,41,199,78,91,147,119,187,232,207,83,52,130,2,233,70,226,182,230,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
