A truck driver, Jude, rescues the exhausted man, who has only a bible for comfort. He brings him to the house of Callie and Clay, two lovers who live in the forest. While Clay is away in the forest, beautiful Callie nurses Darkly back to health, and he develops an obsession with her that is totally contrary to his upbringing - a sexual obsession. When Clay returns home and Darkly sees the two lovers kiss, it is too much for him. Every night he hears them making love. Darkly's descent into madness has begun... An extremely dramatical and exciting ending!\n\n\n\nThis is an unusual film.\n\nThe summary above does a fair description of the plot, but what it doesn't describe is the air of magic around the forest and everyone's encounters within it. It's hard to describe this, except to say that the film both brings you together with one character's descent into madness while also introducing you to people who seem as though they stepped right out of a story book.\n\nAt times, it has the feel of some children's tale of a lost soul wandering through the woods, encountering various odd characters. Some are endearing, some are frightening.\n\nThe difference is that this isn't a children's tale, and the emotions and imperatives are being experienced by adults, though not always with a mature sense of self-control.\n\nAshley Judd is both eerily wistful and intensely sensuous as a young lady seemingly without any concept of shame or self consciousness, and deeply in love. Brendan Fraser does a credible job of portraying an inexperienced, painfully conflicted child-man and seems to sweat this tension from every pore.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/faIFlaAdF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/faIFlaAdF&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FAIFmaAdF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FAIFmaAdF&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FaifNAAdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FaifNAAdf&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FAIfOaadf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FAIfOaadf&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/fAIfpAADf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/fAIfpAADf&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSEED AND SHARE!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1b4c91e7cf471f466f5f66c1297dc6047a330a2","amp;dn":"The+Passion+of+Darkly+Noon+%5B1995%5D+DVDRIP+-+Erotic+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1b4c91e7cf471f466f5f66c1297dc6047a330a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,180,201,30,124,244,113,244,102,245,246,108,18,151,220,96,71,163,48,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
