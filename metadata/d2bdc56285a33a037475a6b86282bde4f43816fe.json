But behind this faÃƒÂ§ade is an entirely different Sigrid, a woman who dreams of her former lover, now lost in the chaos of the war. Her lover is a Jew.\n\nBut Sigrid is not the only one with secrets. \n\nA high ranking SS officer and his family move down the hall and Sigrid finds herself pulled into their orbit.  A young woman doing her duty-year is out of excuses before Sigrid can even ask her any questions.  And then thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the blind man selling pencils on the corner, whose eyes Sigrid can feel following her from behind the darkness of his goggles.\n\nSoon Sigrid is embroiled in a world she knew nothing about, and as her eyes open to the reality around her, the carefully constructed fortress of solitude she has built over the years begins to collapse. She must choose to act on what is right and what is wrong, and what falls somewhere in the shadows between the two. \nIn this page-turning novel, David Gillham explores what happens to ordinary people thrust into extraordinary times, and how the choices they make can be the difference between life and death.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2bdc56285a33a037475a6b86282bde4f43816fe","amp;dn":"City+of+Women+-+David+Gillham.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2bdc56285a33a037475a6b86282bde4f43816fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,189,197,98,133,163,58,3,116,117,166,184,98,130,189,228,244,56,22,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
