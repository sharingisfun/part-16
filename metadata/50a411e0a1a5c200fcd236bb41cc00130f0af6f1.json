So why did a mysterious agency within the American government undo all that work by releasing a report a few days ago that claims Iran stopped the development of nuclear weapons in 2003?\n\nThere's a lot of possible reasons for this report. One is that the report was created by some Americans who are standing up to Israel and trying to prevent a war with Iran. However, it's also possible that this report is just another Zionist trick to hurt the Bush administration and help get Democrats elected.\n\nThe report is not very honest or useful. It doesn't explain that the propaganda to attack Iran is coming from the Zionists, and it doesn't explain the Zionist role in 9/11, or the Iraq war, the world wars, or the Holocaust. It also doesn't explain why we allow Israel to have nuclear weapons. The only thing this report does is to make the Bush administration appear incompetent.\n\nFurthermore, consider the possibility that Iran is indeed developing nuclear weapons. If Iran announces in the future that they have finally created a nuclear bomb, then the Israeli government will be able to proudly announce, &quot;See, we told you so!&quot;\n\nThe Zionists would then be able to complain that America's intelligence agencies are incompetent, and that would allow them to justify replacing the leadership in the intelligence agencies. The Zionists could end up with even more control over our nation than they have right now if we don't watch out for these type of tricks.\n\nFurthermore, consider what I mentioned in my other audio files. Namely, that within the Zionist network there are factions secretly fighting for control of the group, and preparing for the day when they have to sacrifice some of their members in order save themselves. We should consider the possibility that some Zionists have realized that Israel is hopeless, and they've decided to sacrifice Israel in order to allow the rest of the Zionist network to remain in control of America, Europe, Australia, and whatever other nations they have.\n\nI don't know why that report was written, but the point I'm trying to make is that the Zionists have outsmarted the Goyim over and over and over during the past few centuries, and let's not let them do it to us again. The only way we're going to protect ourselves is to be suspicious of every event and every person. We've got to get into the habit of asking, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWho benefits from this?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ And ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIs there a connection to Zionism?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThink of yourself as walking through a minefield. You must be constantly on the lookout for their tricks. We have to be suspicious of every event, including that the recent shooting at the shopping mall in Omaha, Nebraska. Instead of assuming that the news reports are honest, we should wonder if this is another Zionist operation. \n\nThe police released some of the 911 phone calls, and I think those phone calls show suspicious aspects to the shooting. One of the phone calls came from Jodi Longmeyer, an employee inside the shopping mall. She saw Robert Hawkins walk out of the elevator with a gun. She called 911 and stayed on the phone for more than 20 minutes. ABC News selected her as Person Of The Week for her bravery and her heroism.\nabcnews.go.com/WN/PersonOfWeek/story?id=3970626&amp;page=1\n\nI'll put a link to her phone call and several of the others so that you can listen to them. If you follow my advice about imagining yourself walking through a minefield, then you'll be suspicious of every person connected to that Omaha shooting, and you'll ask such questions as, &quot;Is Jodi Longmeyer a real witness, or is she a Zionist agent?&quot;\n\nIf that shooting was a Zionist operation, then the Zionists would have arranged for one or more of their agents to be a part of the shooting. Their agents would be analogous to explosives that are hidden in a minefield. We should get into the habit of looking for those hidden Zionist agents. We should get into the habit of asking, &quot;Are any of these witnesses Zionist agents?&quot;\n\nKeep in mind that the Zionists have a history of pretending to be witnesses, investigators, policemen, Christians, atheists, and Muslims.\n\nThe news reporters will inadvertently help us narrow down the possible agents because they prefer to give their agents the most publicity. But don't let them intimidate you. When we question the honesty of Jody Longmeyer, the Zionists will try to intimidate us with such remarks as, &quot;How dare you bring suspicion on an innocent woman!&quot;\n\nRespond to those type of accusations by pointing out that there were phony witnesses at the Pentagon and at the World Trade Center, and you simply want to ensure that the witnesses to this shooting are honest.\n\nWhat would you think if somebody offered to sell you a bar of gold or a house, and when you asked to look at it closely, you were reprimanded with a remark such as, &quot;How dare you not trust me!&quot;\n\nWe routinely inspect products before we purchase them, but people are afraid to investigate witnesses, investigators, and government officials. However, there's nothing wrong with investigating people. In fact, we're fools to give blind trust to anybody. So don't be intimidated.\n\nThe reason I suggest we look at Jodi Longmeyer is because her phone call was different from the other 911 phone calls. Her call reminds me of the wierd calls from Flight 93 during the September 11th attack. \n\nPeople like Alex Jones encourage us to buy guns and live in fear of psychotic people and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe GlobalistsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nSpeaking of Jones, he interviewed ex-CIA agent Robert Baer on December 6th, 2007. Once you realize that Zionists are responsible for 9/11 and other crimes, this interview seems ridiculous. Here is an excerpt in which they're talking about the report that Iran is not developing nuclear weapons. Robert Baer says that Iran has beaten us. Jones promotes the possibility that Iran might stage a terrorist attack:\n\n    Jones:\n    What would happen if there was a precipitous event in the next few months, a terror attack, or one of our interests was hit. I mean, do you think Iran would do something like that and bring the wrath of the US in, or do you think somebody else would do something?\n\n    Baer:\n    I think they've already won. I'm writing a book on Iran and I think they've won. I mean, I just think that we're going to be facing a new Tehran, and we better not hope they're as malicious as they claim to be...\n\n    Jones:\n    But you say that Iran has won, Pax Americana / Anglo-American / US / Israel / England has lost, couldn't somebody in the Neocon camp stage or provocateur or allow something to happen to get us back in the game?\n\n    Baer:\n    Yeah, I mean the only way you're going to get back into the game is if we reimpose the draft, we put a million soldiers in Iraq, in the Gulf. That's the only way we can get back in the game.\n\n    Jones:\n    But if there was another terror attack couldn't that be the...\n\n    Baer:\n    That's the only way you're going to do it. Otherwise Americans [garbled], what do you mean we're spending $1 trillion a year in Iraq?\n\n    Jones:\n    Well let's be clear. You're saying without another terror attack the agenda to invade or attack Iran is dead?\n\n    Baer:\n    Absolutely.\n\n    Jones:\n    So who would launch that terror attack?\n\n    Baer:\n    Well, use your imagination. [giggles]\n\n    Jones:\n    [laughs]\n\n    Baer:\n    Who is interest is it in? It's in Saudi Arabia's interest, for instance.\n\n    Jones:\n    Because they're enemies with Iran.\n\n    Baer:\n    Yeah, so who's going to protect them against Iran unless there's an attack in this country?\n\n    Jones:\n    Ooooh! I never thought of that! I never thought of that! Start a war against Islamo-fascism to aim them at Iran. \n\nIn one of my other audio files I pointed out that Daryl Smith frequently claims that most Jews are innocent. But on December 5th he reversed himself. Listen to this:\n\n    Smith:\n    And, you know, if there's only 10,000 or 50,000 or 100,000 of the Jewish community not involved, which it's way bigger than that, we've got to protect the innocent in this fight because we are not going to be the monsters that we're fighting. We can't be that way.\n\nNow Smith admits that maybe only a small percentage of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJewish communityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are innocent. He also repeats something that he said before, and which Alex Jones and other people also talk about. Specifcially, Smith says that we must protect the innocent Jews.\n\nBefore I discuss this issue, imagine that you live in a wooden house and that the roof of your house is on fire. Imagine that you have several minutes to take items out of your house. Have you ever considered which items in your house you would save?\n\nWhat would you think of a person who saved the most worthless items in his house, such as the bag of garbage in his kitchen, or some old clothing that he no longer wanted?\n\nOr imagine that you were on the Titanic and that you were in control of who gets saved and who dies. Who would you select to be saved? Would you judge people according to their age, or how much money they have, or their education, their religion, or whether they have a useful skill? How would you make a decision?\n\nOr imagine that a volcano erupts in the middle of the ocean and forms a new island, similar to Hawaii. Imagine that you claim the island, and it becomes your very own nation. Who would you allow into your nation? Would you allow wealthy Hollywood stars to become citizens? Or would you prefer ordinary, working-class people? Or would you want your nation to be for poor people, or criminals, or people with alcohol problems?\n\nOr imagine that you want to start a business. Who would you look for as employees? Would you look for people who have already proven themselves to do a good job? Or would you prefer to take the people who have trouble finding jobs?\n\nThe attitude in America and Europe is to feel sorry for the loser. Americans often refer to this as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œprotecting the UnderdogÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Unfortunately, we don't help a person when we feel sorry for them. The only way to help people is to provide them with information to help themselves. If they don't respond to the information, it's too bad for them.\n\nDaryl Smith, Alex Jones, and many other people in the so-called truth movement encourage us to protect the innocent and defend the helpless. \n\nMy attitude is, I'm not responsible for protecting anybody. If I want to help somebody, it's my decision, and the only people I'm interested in protecting are the people I consider to be valuable members of the human race. If my house was on fire, I would not save the bag of garbage. If I was going to start my own nation, I would want people who are going to take care of themselves and contribute to society. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Zionist crime network is very large, and some of its members are the most disgusting creatures the human race has ever produced. It's extremely risky for us to assume a Jew is innocent. We should avoid every Jew, and investigate all of them. Don't forget about Christopher Bollyn and his family. A few of the people he trusted were Jews, and look at where he is today. Actually, where is he? He won't even tell us what continent he's living on.\n\nAnd where is Carol Valentine? Jim Condit Jr. claims to speak with Carol Valentine by phone, but she won't talk to anybody else. And where is Peter Kawaja?\n\nIn August of 2007 I posted a document in which I wondered if Ahmed Rami, who has the website radioislam.org, is still alive. About a month later, a man in Sweden named Kristar, who became Daryl Smith's webmaster after I stopped working with Smith, told me that he recently spoke with Ahmed Rami, or actually met him in person, I can't remember exactly, and Kristar reassured me that I didn't have to worry about him being dead or kidnapped.\n\nHowever, why should I believe somebody who is willing to work with Smith now that I exposed what Smith really is?\n\nIsn't it peculiar that the people who reassure us that Carol Valentine and Ahmed Rami are doing fine are the people who associate with Zionist agents?\n\nMonths ago Jimmy Walter sent out an e-mail message to people that he was quitting the 9/11 movement and he was not going to answer e-mail any longer. He was going into some time of seclusion. Yesterday I got a suspicious e-mail message from him. I'll post it so you can read it. \n\nHe sent me a link to a video of Steven Greer and his Disclosure Project, and he told me that Apollo astronauts saw UFOs on their trip to the moon, and they saw structures on the moon.\n\nThis may not seem too strange to you, but this is not the way Jimmy Walter used to talk to me, but I have gotten many similar messages from anonymous people, and similar messages are often posted on Internet message boards. This is typical Zionist propaganda. So why is it coming from Jimmy Walter's e-mail address? Where is Jimmy Walter?\n\nUntil Christopher Bollyn and his family disappeared mysteriously, a lot of people had a difficult time believing that the Zionists would do something such as kidnap somebody and pretend that they're still free, or kill them and have an imposter take their place.\n\nHave you ever heard about the sex slave trade? There's a very large market for children who are purchased and kept in a house for sex. People are doing this right now with children, so what's so difficult to believe that somebody would keep the entire Bollyn family as prisoners in their basement? \n\n\nWhat is a &quot;Hispanic&quot;? Most people consider Hispanics to be people in Mexico, Central America and South America who speak Spanish or Portuguese. \n\nBut if we're going to treat the interbreeding of Native Americans with Spaniards and Portuguese as a race of people, why not consider the interbreeding of Chinese and Native Americans as a special race? We could call them Chipanics. And there are Africans who have interbred with some of the Native Americans. We could call them Afripanics.\n\nWhy not allow universities to create courses on Chipanic studies and Afripanic studies? And what about the mixture of German and Irish? Why not consider that mixture a new race? \n\nThen consider Tiger Woods, who is a mixture of African, Chinese, Native American, Thai, and Dutch. Why not refer to everybody with his particular mixture as a new race of people, and why not have university courses about that particular race? \n\nAs I mentioned in my Dumbing Down series of articles, schools developed thousands of years ago to help teach arithmetic and language, and it does a very good job of that. But during the past few thousand years, a lot of new courses were added to the schools, and many of them are worthless. Schools are adding useless courses simply to provide jobs for college graduates. For example, the people who get Ph.D.'s in philosophy, or Hispanic studies, or women's studies are putting pressure on the universities to create more silly departments so that they can get jobs at the University.\n\nIt's possible to create useful courses about philosophy, Hispanics, and even women, but that's not what our schools are doing. Our schools are degrading into welfare institutions for people with college degrees. Our government and our school system is like a sponge that's soaking up the unemployable and mentally ill people. By creating useless jobs, they lower the unemployment rate and create the impression that our economy is doing great, but these worthless people put a burden on the rest of us by increasing taxes and the cost of school. \n\nWe've got to overhaul both the government and the school system. Our schools today are not providing children with useful skills, or a useful education, and worst of all, it ruins the morale of people who do poorly in school, and it encourages arrogance among the people who do good in school. School is primarily a test of a person's ability to memorize information, not their ability to think or face reality, so the people who do good in school and not necessarily intelligent, and they're not necessarily in good mental health. \n\nFurthermore, a lot of the information that's taught at school is inaccurate, and some of it is Zionist propaganda. Take a look at how many college graduates believe in the Holocaust and the Apollo moon landing. Those graduates wasted thousands of dollars and many years of their lives to memorize Zionist propaganda. They are suckers.\n\nAnd look at all the people who have educations in Hispanic studies. Some of them have been fooled into thinking that the homeland for Mexicans is southern California and Mexico. Some of these so-called educated people believe that the Mexicans should take back their homeland in California. It would make more sense for the true natives of America and Mexico to complain that they want their land back from the Mexicans.\n\nThis same problem is occurring with China. The Chinese are not one group of people. They are slightly different groups with slightly different languages. It doesn't make any sense for one group Chinese in mainland China to claim that Taiwan belongs to them.\n\nThis problem is occurring with India, also. India is not one group of people. As with China, India consists of slightly differing groups of people who have been pushing one another around for a long time.\n\nWe've got to stop these idiotic fantasies of regaining homelands. There is no group of people who can seriously claim that a portion of the planet belongs to them. People have been moving around the planet for thousands of years. There's no location that belongs to anybody in particular.\n\nMillions of Jews believe that Palestine belongs to them because some Jews lived there briefly a couple thousand years ago, but even if we agree that the Jews should have Palestine, who among us is actually a direct descendent of the original Jews of Palestine? The people around the Mediterranean have been interbreeding so much during the past 2000 years that it's possible that there are no original Jews remaining.\n\nSome of the people who refer to themselves as Sephardic Jews may not have any original Jews in their ancestry. Some Sephardic Jews might be Ashkenazi Jews who got their brown skin coloring from some darker race. Nobody's ancestry can be accurately traced back 2000 years, so anybody who claims to be one of the original Jews is simply making a wild guess.\n\nBesides, nobody knows where the original Jews came from. Palestine may not be their original homeland. Their original homeland might be some area of Turkey, or Africa.\n\nThis issue of giving Palestine back to the Jews is nonsense no matter how you look at it. Furthermore, their attempt to regain their homeland in Palestine has been causing wars and chaos for more than a thousand years. And today the Jews are trying to trick us into starting a war with Iran.\n\nTake a look at what the history books say about the Khazars. Although details of people who lived a thousand years ago is full of speculation, the Khazars are described as a wild, savage, brutal group of people. We ought to consider the possibility that they really are slightly worse than the rest of us. This would explain why the Khazarian Jews have been involved for centuries with blood sacrifices, drugs, gambling, murder, pornography, prostitution, slavery, kidnapping, torture, deception, pedophilia, rape, and crime.\n\nWe don't know anything about the original Jews, but for all we know, they were also a group of disgusting savages. We are fools to assume the original Jews were wonderful people. If the stories are correct that the Jews pushed the Romans into killing Jesus, that means the original Jews were behaving just like the Khazarian Jews of today who are pushing us into attacking Iran. It's the same disgusting behavior. How many more thousands of years are we going to put up with these freaks?\n\nDid you know that Alex Jones and other people have described the New World Order as being similar to insects that lay eggs on other animals, and when the eggs hatch, the babies eat their hosts? I'll put a link to the excerpt of Alex Jones talking about this. Once you realize that Jones is part of this New World Order, then you realize that he's describing himself, and Naomi Wolf, Daryl Smith, Noam Chomsky, Steven Spielberg, and all of the other Khazar savages who infiltrate our societies and pretend to be our friends, but who are secretly cheating us, killing us, kidnapping us, and abusing us. We ought to consider the possibility that the reason our ancestors have been complaining about the Khazars for centuries is because they really are disgusting savages.\n\nPeople might say I'm being harsh, but look at their behavior. They are the ones who are cruel and harsh. Listen to Michael Savage as he talks about Jimmy Carter.\n\n    Savage:\n    Jimmy Carter is a Jew hater through and through. Jimmy Carter is who caused worldwide Islamic terrorism to proliferate around the globe. Jimmy Carter undermined the Shah of Iran. Jimmy Carter encouraged Khomeini to come back from exile in Paris. As a result Khomeini spread his Islamic poison around the globe.\n\n    Jimmy Carter is a war criminal. Now Jimmy Carter comes out and writes a letter today and says that Israel, by giving back 93% of the West Bank, is being evil, it's the Jews again tricking the Palestinians. Jimmy Carter is like Hitler with a doubletalk on top of it all. I can't take this sh... crap anymore. Why is he even taken seriously? Why don't the Jews get up and spit in his face?\n\n\nIf any of us were to talk about Jews in the manner in which they talk about us, we would be condemned, so why do we allow them to treat us in this awful manner?\n\nIf Michael Savage can talk about &quot;Islamic poison&quot;, why can't we talk about &quot;Jewish poison&quot; or a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKhazar poisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½? If Michael Savage can suggest that Jews spit in Jimmy Carter's face, why can't we suggest that people spit in the face of Michael Savage or Shimon Perez or Mike Wallace?\n\nWe've got to stand up to them. Don't let them intimidate you. It is them who are behaving in a disgusting manner, and for centuries. It's a pattern with them. And the Zionist crime network seems to be attracting the worst of them.\n\nMy advice is to wonder what they are doing with Christopher Bollyn, and listen to Daryl Smith's phone call to me, and ask yourself, what kind of people are these? Be careful about trusting people, especially if they promote Israel or Zionism. We're dealing with some extremely violent, selfish, and psychotic freaks. Don't be intimidated when they complain that your suspicion is hurting their feelings, or that you're insulting to them. We will protect ourselves by being suspicious of everybody and investigating everybody. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50a411e0a1a5c200fcd236bb41cc00130f0af6f1","amp;dn":"Eric+Hufschmid+-+Zionist+Media+Trying+To+Fool+Us+Hating+Iran","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50a411e0a1a5c200fcd236bb41cc00130f0af6f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,164,17,224,161,165,194,0,252,210,54,187,65,204,0,19,15,10,246,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
