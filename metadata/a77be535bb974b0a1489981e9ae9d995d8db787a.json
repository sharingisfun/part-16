Delmore Schwartz, the most influential critic in postwar America, wrote of Patrick O'Brian's first novel Testimonies: &quot;A triumph . . . drawn forward by lyric eloquence and the story's fascination, [the reader] discovers in the end that he has encountered in a new way the sphinx and the riddle of existence itself.&quot; Schwartz' imagination was fired by this sinister tale of love and death set in Wales, a timeless story with echoes of Thomas Hardy and Mary Webb. \n\nJoseph Pugh, sick of Oxford and of teaching, decides to take some time off to live in a wild and beautiful Welsh farm valley. There he falls physically ill and is nursed back to health by Bronwen Vaughn, the wife of a neighboring farmer. Slowly, unwillingly, Bronwen and Pugh fall in love; and while that word is never spoken between them, their story is as passionate and as tragic as that of Vronsky and Anna Karenina.\n\nGenre: Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a77be535bb974b0a1489981e9ae9d995d8db787a","amp;dn":"Testimonies+by+Patrick+O%27Brian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a77be535bb974b0a1489981e9ae9d995d8db787a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,123,229,53,187,151,75,10,20,137,152,30,154,233,217,149,216,219,120,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
