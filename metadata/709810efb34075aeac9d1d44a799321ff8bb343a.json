With Cassavetes, a basic written theme is provided and the actors embellish upon it; rhythms, tempos and emotional counterpoint are deftly manipulated. In HUSBANDS, Cassavetes is the bandleader, and Peter Falk and Ben Gazzara prove themselves to be two of the best &quot;jazz actors&quot; ever. HUSBANDS is &quot;a guy film.&quot; Women have their &quot;girl films,&quot; but here's one for we men (and for women who want to understand men). Cassavetes, Falk and Gazzara play three best friends who have just lost their fourth to a sudden death. The surviving three, all 40-something, run away from their marriages, jobs and other shackles for a few days in search of themselves, meaning, purpose. Along the way, we are intimately exposed to their fears, dreams, passions, disgusts, and their love for each other (expertly depicted male bonding: guys who understand each others' emotions, with masculinity remaining intact). Perhaps no other filmmaker/actor combo than Cassavetes and his &quot;company&quot; of actors have ever succeeded as well at depicting so uncompromisingly life's emotional truth. Mind you, Cassavetes' style and camera paints in broad loose strokes, so be forewarned if you dislike a hand-held shaky camera and sometimes out-of-focus shots as the camera operator tries to follow the improvising actor. But HUSBANDS has far less of this than, say, Cassavetes' FACES. And this is not all a downer film; there's much humor, too, in its sometimes bittersweet mood (for example, the Countess scene: &quot;take your hand off my hand&quot;) All in all, and though a little long, a great film; well worth the time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:709810efb34075aeac9d1d44a799321ff8bb343a","amp;dn":"Husbands+by+John+Cassavetes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"709810efb34075aeac9d1d44a799321ff8bb343a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,152,16,239,179,64,117,174,172,157,29,68,167,153,50,31,248,187,52,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
