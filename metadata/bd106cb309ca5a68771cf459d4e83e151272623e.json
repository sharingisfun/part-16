For two decades, investigator Greg Palast has been on BP's trail. In BP: In Deep Water, Palast takes Dispatches viewers along on his world-wide investigation of the oil giant.\nOne year after BP's Deepwater Horizon rig blew apart and spewed 170 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, BP claims victory ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ that most of the oil is gone. But one clean-up worker tells Dispatches he's not allowed to actually dig effectively for the spilled oil. He's ordered to only skim the top quarter inch with a pet-litter scooper. Palast walks across one still-slimed beach with a marine biologist who describes 'BP's clean up theatre' as 'superficial' and 'cosmetic'. He shows us the oil still coming ashore, and the oil still deep beneath the beach surface.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: Xvid\nVideo Bitrate: 1891 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 416\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.731\nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: MP3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s MP3 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 49mins\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 700 MB\nSource: PDTV\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd106cb309ca5a68771cf459d4e83e151272623e","amp;dn":"Ch4+Dispatches+2011+BP+In+Deep+Water+PDTV+Xvid+MP3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd106cb309ca5a68771cf459d4e83e151272623e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,16,108,179,9,202,90,104,119,28,244,89,212,232,62,21,18,114,98,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
