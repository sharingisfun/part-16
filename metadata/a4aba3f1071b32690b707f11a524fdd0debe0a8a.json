Eighteen of his number one hits (as well as some wonderful lesser known tracks) will keep you grooving along for a long time. You will NOT regret owning this collection.&quot;\n\n&quot;Barry White had a way of expressing himself. he had that cold vocal presentation, incredible arrangements, and those string arrangements and the Rhythm tracks alone had so much Groove and tone. you couldn't put Barry White's music under one category because he had a strong Hybrid and he was also so Soulful,but yet his timing and Melody was a Opening for all. this collection has all of his Jams and thensome. I've always been a Huge fan of his work and all of his main jams are here. He was One of the Baddest Musical Artists Ever. Timeless!&quot;\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
