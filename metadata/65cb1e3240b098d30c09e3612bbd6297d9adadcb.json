Beginning with a review of statistics, it presents the core topics needed to fully comprehend the design of temporary structures: strength of materials; types of loads on temporary structures; scaffolding design; soil properties and soil loading; soldier beam, lagging, and tiebacks; sheet piling and strutting; pressure and forces on formwork and falsework; concrete formwork design; falsework; bracing and guying; trestles and equipment bridges; and the support of existing structures.\n\nTemporary structures during construction include scaffolding, formwork, shoring, ramps, platforms, earth-retaining structures, and other construction structures that are not part of the permanent installation. These structures are less regulated and monitored than most other parts of the construction process, even though they are often supporting tons of steel or concreteÃ¢â‚¬â€and the safety of all workers on the site depends on these structures to perform as designed. Unfortunately, most tragic failures occur during construction and are usually the result of improperly designed, constructed, and/or maintained temporary structures. Temporary Structure Design fills an important need in the literature by providing a trusted, comprehensive guide to designing temporary construction structures.\n\nServes as the first book to provide a design-oriented approach to the design of temporary structures\nIncludes coverage of the various safety considerations inherent in temporary structure design and construction\nProvides information on estimating cost and schedules for these specialized structures\nCovers formwork and falsework, as well as personnel protection, production support, environmental protection, and foundational structures\nIf you're a student or a professional working in the field of construction or structural engineering, Temporary Structure Design is a must-have resource you'll turn to again and again","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65cb1e3240b098d30c09e3612bbd6297d9adadcb","amp;dn":"Temporary+Structure+Design++%5BMyeBookShelf%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65cb1e3240b098d30c09e3612bbd6297d9adadcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,203,30,50,64,176,152,211,12,9,227,97,43,189,98,151,217,173,173,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
