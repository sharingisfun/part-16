It covers both Juniper and Cisco routing, and touches on other vendor implementations. It focuses on routing policy, covering Border Gateway Protocol in depth and includes real-world multi vendor configuration examples.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4716f4ffeec87bc6c3b575d3c9f09c0a9adc9055","amp;dn":"Juniper+and+Cisco+Routing%3A+Policy+and+Protocols+for+Multivendor+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4716f4ffeec87bc6c3b575d3c9f09c0a9adc9055","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,22,244,255,238,200,123,198,195,181,117,211,201,240,156,10,154,220,144,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
