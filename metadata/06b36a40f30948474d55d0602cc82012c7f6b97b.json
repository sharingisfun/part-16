The Lord of the Nations is, according to Sri Aurobindo, a disincarnate demonic force bent on Global hegemony. According to them, The Mother's ex was channeling this entity -- and later, so was Hitler. According to the stories, Sri Aurobindo impersonated this entity on the inner planes and told Hitler to invade Russia -- leading eventually to the defeat of the German army. Anyway, this book might be of interest to people familiar with Sri Aurobindo and The Mother.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06b36a40f30948474d55d0602cc82012c7f6b97b","amp;dn":"Paul+Richard+-+The+Lord+of+The+Nations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06b36a40f30948474d55d0602cc82012c7f6b97b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,179,106,64,243,9,72,71,77,85,208,96,44,200,32,18,199,246,185,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
