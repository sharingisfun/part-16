It ended in March/April 2014.\n\nStudents will explore energy consumption patterns including individuals, countries and the entire globe. These patterns will include all sectors of the global economy from fully developed countries to developing nations. New energy sources will be investigated and international solutions to future needs will be analyzed.\n\nThis general education course will cover concepts of work and energy and their relationship with our modern society. Each aspect of this relationship with energy will be analyzed including consumptive patterns for the residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors of our economy. Geological sources for fossil fuels will be examined as will the differences between reserves and production. Energy capacities and limitations for new sources of renewable energies will also be examined. All of these topics will be examined within a national and international context.\n\nMore information about this course is available at https://coursera.org/course/globalenergy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28ce1339b8d376f1714839d3f91c85421fc487b8","amp;dn":"%5BCoursera%5D+Global+Sustainable+Energy+-+Past%2C+Present+and+Future","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28ce1339b8d376f1714839d3f91c85421fc487b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,206,19,57,184,211,118,241,113,72,57,211,249,28,133,66,31,196,135,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
