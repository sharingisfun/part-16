ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also been described as a good mix of a masculine and feminine universe. Sepiamusic finds it difficult to place the music in a specific genre, because it holds elements of many different genres. Michael is inspired primarily by electronic music from the last 20 years. Erin also has a love for electronic music, but grew up listening to music from the 1940ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s to the 1970ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s. Sepiamusic is not about creating the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½sound of nowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, but creating the distinct sound of Sepiamusic.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1957cac1c3eeda613fbd942a61dd7b5f8b3f77d0","amp;dn":"Sepiamusic+-+Prototype+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1957cac1c3eeda613fbd942a61dd7b5f8b3f77d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,87,202,193,195,238,218,97,63,189,148,42,97,221,123,95,139,63,119,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
