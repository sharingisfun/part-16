Staind happens to be my favorite band and I have taken the time to make sure each and every one of these albums is complete. :) Enjoy! This torrent is Studio albums only. I did not rerip MP3s or anything like that. These came directly from my CDs so there aren't any leaks or anything and a few bonus tracks may not be here. Sorry but I did not want to trade quality for quantity. Anyways, enjoy these amazing CDs!\n\nEncoding: \nM4A AAC Lossy\n256 Kbps CBR\nChannels: Stereo\n44100Hz\n\nAlbum Info:\n\nTormented (1996):\n01 Tolerate\n02 Come Again\n03 Break\n04 Painful\n05 Nameless\n06 Mudshuvel\n07 See Thru\n08 Question\n09 No One's Kind\n10 Self Destruct\n11 4 Walls\n\nDysfunction (1999):\n01 Suffocate\n02 Just Go\n03 Me\n04 Raw\n05 Mudshovel\n06 Home\n07 A Flat\n08 Crawl\n09 Spleen\n10 Bring the Noise\n*Just like the CD the extra song Excess Baggage (Secret Song) starts around the 15 min mark on Bring The Noise (I did NOT seperate the tracks... sorry)*\n\nBreak the Cycle (2001):\n01 Open Your Eyes\n02 Pressure\n03 Fade\n04 It's Been Awhile\n05 Change\n06 Can't Believe\n07 Epiphany\n08 Suffer\n09 Safe Place\n10 For You\n11 Outside\n12 Waste\n13 Take It\n14 It's Been Awhile (Acoustic)\n\n14 Shades of Grey (2003):\n01 Price to Play\n02 How About You\n03 So Far Away\n04 Yesterday\n05 Fray\n06 Zoe Jane\n07 Fill Me Up\n08 Layne\n09 Falling Down\n10 Reality\n11 Tonight\n12 Could It Be\n13 Blow Away\n14 Intro\n\nChapter V (2005):\n01 Run Away\n02 Right Here\n03 Paper Jesus\n04 Schizophrenic Conversations\n05 Falling\n06 Cross to Bear\n07 Devil\n08 Please\n09 Everything Changes\n10 Take This\n11 King of All Excuses\n12 Reply\n13 Let It Out\n14 Novocaine\n15 Reply (Original Version)\n16 It's Been Awhile (Acoustic)\n17 This Is Beetle aka 'The Beetlejuice Song'\n\nThe Illusion of Progress (2008):\n01 This Is It\n02 The Way I Am\n03 Believe\n04 Save Me\n05 All I Want\n06 Pardon Me\n07 Lost Along the Way\n08 Break Away\n09 Tangled Up in You\n10 Raining Again\n11 Rainy Day Parade\n12 The Corner\n13 Nothing Left to Say\n14 It's Been Awhile (Acoustic) (live)\n15 Devil (Acoustic) (live)\n16 Schizophrenic Conversations (live)\n\nStaind (2011):\n01 Eyes Wide Open\n02 Not Again\n03 Failing\n04 Wannabe\n05 Throw It All Away\n06 Take a Breath\n07 The Bottom\n08 Now\n09 Paper Wings\n10 Something to Remind You\n\nSeed, Comment, and Rate!\n\nOH AND HAPPY NEW YEARS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fa66d35f73eee781bd69a2d9946dc7197469c38","amp;dn":"Staind+%28Studio+Discography%29+%28iTunes%29+%2ATyMoD%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fa66d35f73eee781bd69a2d9946dc7197469c38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,166,109,53,247,62,238,120,27,214,154,45,153,70,220,113,151,70,156,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
