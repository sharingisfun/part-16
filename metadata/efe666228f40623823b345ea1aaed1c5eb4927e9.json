How are ancient civilizations linked together and what does it say about human instinct? Join Dr Kara Cooney, UCLA Professor of Egyptian Art and Architecture, as she visits tombs and temples around the world bringing an exciting new perspective to the most fascinating riddles in history.\n\n\n\n\n6)  Flesh and Bone \nThe bodies of our hallowed dead -- preserved and worshiped for generations. These objects are often called 'relics,' and their existence represents a near universal behavior in human culture. A relic could be the finger of a Catholic saint or a mummified ibis bird buried in an ancient Egyptian catacomb. For millennia people have ascribed meaning and power to the remnants of their hallowed dead. Egyptologist Dr. Kara Cooney visits sites of pilgrimage, both ancient and modern, to explain the reasons and motives behind the value we place on treasured flesh and bone.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2185 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x400\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.760:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 43:32.560\nNumber Of Parts: 6\nPart Size: 743 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efe666228f40623823b345ea1aaed1c5eb4927e9","amp;dn":"DC.Out.of.Egypt.6of6.Flesh.and.Bone.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efe666228f40623823b345ea1aaed1c5eb4927e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,230,102,34,143,64,98,56,35,179,69,234,26,174,209,197,235,73,39,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
