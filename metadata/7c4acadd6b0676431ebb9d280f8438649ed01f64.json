I tried to re-scan those pages and add them to the document, but I probably missed a few. The original paper copies have been destroyed, so there will be no correcting these PDFs.\n\nGood luck keeping those blood sugars inline!\n\n--RecycledElectrons","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c4acadd6b0676431ebb9d280f8438649ed01f64","amp;dn":"Diabetes+Forecast+Magazines+from+2011+and+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c4acadd6b0676431ebb9d280f8438649ed01f64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,74,202,221,107,6,118,67,30,187,157,40,15,132,56,100,158,208,31,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
