Many artists take the opportunity to present their songs in unfamiliar arrangements or to perform covers of songs that influenced their careers. In this particular episode, the legendary Bob Dylan performs songs from his remarkable career, including an unreleased performance of the song &quot;John Brown&quot;.\n\nBob Dylan (vocals, guitar, harmonica); John Jackson (guitar); Bucky Baxter (pedal steel guitar, dobro); Brendan O&amp;#039;Brien (Hammond organ); Tony Garnier (bass); Winston Watson (drums).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc8065756c4f2f84dfee3f812e826865996136ea","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+MTV+Unplugged+Full+Dvd+Pal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc8065756c4f2f84dfee3f812e826865996136ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,128,101,117,108,79,47,132,223,238,63,129,46,130,104,101,153,97,54,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
