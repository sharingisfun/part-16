She and her handsome hubby currently reside in Pennsylvania with a four-pack of teenage boys. If she gets time off from her duties as maid, chef, chauffeur, or therapist, she can be found reading just about anything she can get her hands on, from Young Adult novels to books on poker theory. She doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like root beer, clowns or bugs (except ladybugs, on account of their cute outfits), but lurrves chocolate, going to the movies, the New York Giants and playing Texas Hold Ã¢â‚¬ËœEm. Writing is her passion, but if she had to pick another occupation, she would be a pirateÃ¢â‚¬Â¦or, like, a ninja maybe. She loves writing steamy romance stories, but also hopes to one day publish something her dad can read without wanting to dig his eyes out with a rusty spoon.\n\nGenre: Contemporary Romance\n\n1. Down for the Count: Truth or dareÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nWhen Lacey Garrity finds her groom in flagrante delicto in the reception hall closet with her bridesmaid, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s saved by her best friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s older brotherÃ¢â‚¬â€childhood tormentor, crush, and boxing bad boy Galen Thomas. GalenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s solution is both exciting and dangerous. What better way to forget the mess of her life than go on her honeymoon with a hot guy who canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t promise anything beyond today?\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¦or TKO?\n\nGalen had been counting on LaceyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wedding to put her out of reachÃ¢â‚¬â€and out of his mindÃ¢â‚¬â€once and for all, but their steamy Puerto Rican escape is testing all his boundaries. Now that LaceyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s embracing her inner bad girl, Galen is tempted to throw in the towel and claim her for himself. But with the biggest fight of his career on the line and an important business merger threatening to derail LaceyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s resolve, their romance might be down for the count before it even begins.\n\n2. Down and Dirty: He was a dare sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d never been able to resistÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nCat Thomas has never been the kind of girl to stick. A self-professed infatuation junky, she latches on the newest, hottest guy on the block, then finds a reasonÃ¢â‚¬â€real or imaginedÃ¢â‚¬â€to dump him. When she accepts a dare to rekindle her high school flame and jump in bed with her brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best friend, Shane Decker, she knows sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in trouble. She canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t resist the man, even after all these years apart, and that just wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do.\n\nShane has come back to town for a couple reasons. The biggest one? HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tired of living away from those he loves, including Cat. But now sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spooked and will do anything to drive a wedge between them, including trying to fix him up with other women through an online dating service.\n\nWhat does he have to do to make her see that settling down doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean settling, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ready to spend a lifetime proving it?\n\n2.5. Down the Aisle: Lacey Garrity is about to have the wedding sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always dreamed of. She and Galen had planned on a big family, but now fertility issues are turning that dream to ashes. When another setback comes to light a week before their wedding day, she wonders how she can marry him knowing that being with her might mean he can never have the life he imaginedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nGalen Thomas loves his woman, and whether they have a big family or itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just the two of them forever, he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait to spend his life with her. With the big day coming, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll pull out all the stops to remind her how good it can be between them and that, together, they can do anythingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦if he can just get her down the aisle.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cad738d52ab4ea2a5e52b72a0144f9f207d3fd3b","amp;dn":"Christine+Bell+-+Dare+Me+Series++%28Books+%231%2C+%232+%26amp%3B+%232.5%29+Epub%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cad738d52ab4ea2a5e52b72a0144f9f207d3fd3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,215,56,213,42,180,234,42,94,82,183,42,1,68,249,242,7,211,253,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
