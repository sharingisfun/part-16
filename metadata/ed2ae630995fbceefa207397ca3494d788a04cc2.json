In its first week of sales, the album debuted at #97 on the US charts. The concert featured many old songs such as &quot;Don't Drink the Water&quot;, &quot;Two Step&quot; and &quot;#41&quot;, as well as more recent songs such as &quot;Corn Bread&quot; and &quot;Eh Hee&quot;.\n\nThis is the first album to be released by the band without saxophonist LeRoi Moore and the first to feature Bela Fleck and the Flecktones saxophonist Jeff Coffin for the entire set. Coffin stepped in for Moore after he was in an ATV accident.\n\nTim Reynolds also sat in as a guest for the complete set, as he did throughout the 2008 summer tour.\n\nIt was released on Tuesday December 16, 2008.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Don't Drink the Water&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:13\n    &quot;You Might Die Trying&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:29\n    &quot;Eh Hee&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:25\n    &quot;Two Step&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 14:05\n    &quot;Proudest Monkey&quot; Ã‚Â» Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8:10\n    &quot;Satellite&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:07\n    &quot;Corn Bread&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:42\n    &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; (Peter Gabriel) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:55\n    &quot;Stay (Wasting Time)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:53\n    &quot;Old Dirt Hill (Bring That Beat Back)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:12\n    &quot;Jimi Thing&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 14:57\n    &quot;#41&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 15:11\n    &quot;Tripping Billies&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:38\n    &quot;So Damn Lucky&quot; - 8:09\n    &quot;So Much to Say&quot; Ã‚Â» Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:46\n    &quot;Anyone Seen the Bridge?&quot; Ã‚Â» Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:59\n    &quot;Too Much&quot;Ã‚Â» Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:10\n    &quot;Ants Marching&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8:50\n    &quot;Gravedigger&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:49\n    &quot;Louisiana Bayou&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:30\n    &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)&quot; (Sly &amp; The Family Stone) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8:17\n\nDave Matthews Band\n\n    Dave Matthews - guitars, lead vocals\n    Boyd Tinsley - violins, backing vocals\n    Stefan Lessard - bass\n    Carter Beauford - drums, percussion, backing vocals\n\nWith Guests\n\n    Jeff Coffin - saxophones\n    Rashawn Ross - trumpet, flugelhorn, backing vocals\n    Tim Reynolds - guitar\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed2ae630995fbceefa207397ca3494d788a04cc2","amp;dn":"Dave+Matthews+Band+-+Live+At+Mile+High+Music+Festival+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed2ae630995fbceefa207397ca3494d788a04cc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,42,230,48,153,95,188,238,250,32,115,151,202,52,148,215,136,160,76,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
