In this course, he shares a hands-on approach to improving interaction design for a better user experience on the web. This course breaks down the components of an example site, from its homepage to categories, content, and the shopping cart, and introduces common customer scenarios that can be used to identify opportunities for improvement. You'll learn how to enhance navigation, gather feedback after interactions, manage content layers, and add features such as infinite scrolling, collapsible modules, and dynamic content to enrich the user's experience. Then compare the before and after websites to understand why these techniques make them more engaging and effective.\n\nTopics include:\n\nDefining a customer scenario\nImproving navigation\nWorking with content in grids\nEstablishing a sense of place on category pages\nExploring infinite scroll and pagination methods\nUsing tooltips to deliver contextual content\nWorking with light boxes and layers\nImproving form structure\nHandling errors and presenting effective error messages\nComparing the original site to the enhanced site","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e937a528edbfe86e66ff354809d7ddb5196d64b","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+Applied+Interaction+Design","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e937a528edbfe86e66ff354809d7ddb5196d64b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,147,122,82,142,219,254,134,230,111,243,84,128,157,125,219,81,150,214,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
