Daft Punk recorded the album largely using live instrumentation with session musicians, and limited the use of electronics to drum machines, a modular synthesizer and vintage vocoders.[4] The album also features collaborations with Panda Bear, Julian Casablancas, Todd Edwards, DJ Falcon, Chilly Gonzales, Giorgio Moroder, Nile Rodgers, Paul Williams and Pharrell Williams. Critical reception to the album has been generally positive.\n\n\nNo.\tTitle\tWriter(s)\t       Length\t\n1.\t&quot;Give Life Back to Music&quot;\t4:34\n2.\t&quot;The Game of Love&quot;  \t        5:21\n3.\t&quot;Giorgio by Moroder&quot;  \t\t9:04\n4.\t&quot;Within&quot;  \t         \t3:48\n5.\t&quot;Instant Crush&quot;         \t5:37\n6.\t&quot;Lose Yourself to Dance&quot; \t5:53\n7.\t&quot;Touch&quot;                 \t8:18\n8.\t&quot;Get Lucky&quot;             \t6:07\n9.\t&quot;Beyond&quot;  \t        \t4:50\n10.\t&quot;Motherboard&quot;  \t        \t5:41\n11.\t&quot;Fragments of Time&quot;     \t4:39\n12.\t&quot;Doin' It Right&quot;        \t4:11\n13.\t&quot;Contact&quot;                       6:21\n\nTPBeire.\nMedia Unbounded.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69cf3f5c1a61f6ae3b699007c60ab78f56921674","amp;dn":"Daft+Punk+Random+Access+Memories+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69cf3f5c1a61f6ae3b699007c60ab78f56921674","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,207,63,92,26,97,246,174,59,105,144,7,198,10,183,143,86,146,22,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
