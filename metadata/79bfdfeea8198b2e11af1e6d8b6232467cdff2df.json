Bankhead 4:53 \n\nSometimes you get so pissed off the only way to cure yourself of the malady is through action, action with purpose, with consequence. Ranting and raving on the sidelines accomplishes dick. Only through direct action can you break free from the suck of an earthbound existence. Knuckle Yummy was born from such an anger, and through direct action, we blossomed. \n\nIn this day and age quality of life is not so quietly being stolen from us while we sleepwalk. This type of deadly oppression gave birth to the blues. Knuckle Yummy wears the modern day cloth of righteous indignation. \n\nIn an era where perfection is readily available, so utterly predictable, we embraced the danger of freefall collaboration, allowing the spirits to rise. You want real? We give you raw, unbridled access. You want grit? Sex? A rumblinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ funk? A big ass grin? Knuckle Yummy fare you well drips with the vitality of a life broken free from its moorings. From the edge we lept, diving headlong into abandon's maw, and that much ain't gonna change. Ever. \n\nMore to come... indubitably. Root like a root hog meanwhile. Spread the gospel... \n\nKnuckle Yummy is Lizzie Lee on vocals and percussion, Pehr Smith on guitar, harmonica, and vocals, Dony Wynn on drums, percussion, and vocals\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/11/04/knuckle-yummy/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79bfdfeea8198b2e11af1e6d8b6232467cdff2df","amp;dn":"Knuckle+Yummy...Knuckle+Yummy%282008%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79bfdfeea8198b2e11af1e6d8b6232467cdff2df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,191,223,238,168,25,139,46,17,175,30,109,139,98,50,70,124,223,242,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
