The garden is overgrown, unloved and badly in need of some TLC. Sam dreams of a trampoline for Amy, a seating area for herself and a colour-filled oasis bursting with oriental style plants.However, money is tight, and with a budget of just Â£1,300 the designers have to pull some tricks out of the bag to make the most of what is there already. They have tips on rejuvenating huge overgrown shrubs, a cost-effective way of replacing a tumble-down boundary fence and ideas for breathing new life into an old slippery deck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 13-Jul-2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad32d1f203913d79b469ba3361a4d9abd04f3260","amp;dn":"Garden+Rescue+S01E03+WEB-DL.x264-JIVE.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad32d1f203913d79b469ba3361a4d9abd04f3260","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,50,209,242,3,145,61,121,180,105,186,51,97,164,217,171,208,79,50,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
