He sings principally in French, Spanish and English and occasionally in a number of other languages.\n\nAfter arriving in Madrid, Chao and other bandmates from Mano Negra formed a new group, Radio Bemba Sound System (named for the communication system used in the Sierra Maestra by the Castro- and Guevara-led rebels in the Cuban revolution), featuring artists from widely varying groups such as Tijuana No! (from Mexico), Skank (from Brazil), and Todos Tus Muertos (from Argentina). The goal was to replicate the sound of street music and bar scenes from a variety of cultures; to that end, Chao and the group spent several years travelling throughout South and Central America, recording new music as they went. The resulting music differed drastically from Mano Negra; the songs were primarily sung in Spanish with far fewer French tracks, and the musical style had shifted from punk and alternative styles to the street vibe Chao was aiming for.\n\nThe songs were collectively released as Clandestino in 1998, under Manu Chao's own name. Though not an instant success, the album gained a steady following in France with hits such as &quot;Bongo Bong&quot; and &quot;Clandestino,&quot; and the album eventually earned the Best World Music Album award in 1999's Victoires de la Musique awards.\n\nTrack names:\n\n01-Manu_Chao-Clandestino.flac\n02-Manu_Chao-Desaparecido.flac\n03-Manu_Chao-Bongo_Bong.flac\n04-Manu_Chao-Je_ne_t'aime_plus.flac\n05-Manu_Chao-Mentira....flac\n06-Manu_Chao-Lagrimas_de_oro.flac\n07-Manu_Chao-Mama_call.flac\n08-Manu_Chao-Luna_y_sol.flac\n09-Manu_Chao-Por_el_suelo.flac\n10-Manu_Chao-Welcome_to_Tijuana.flac\n11-Manu_Chao-Dia_luna..._dia_pena.flac\n12-Manu_Chao-Malegria.flac\n13-Manu_Chao-La_vie_a_2.flac\n14-Manu_Chao-Minha_galera.flac\n15-Manu_Chao-La_despedida.flac\n16-Manu_Chao-El_viento.flac","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5ae096e8dc5094ff11693dc33e955f3bbd07022","amp;dn":"Manu+Chao+-+1998+-+Clandestino+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5ae096e8dc5094ff11693dc33e955f3bbd07022","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,174,9,110,141,197,9,79,241,22,147,220,51,233,85,243,187,208,112,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
