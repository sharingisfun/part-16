The young filmmakers confront people the whole world had forgotten about and know to make them feel very uncomfortable. From time to time the film tends to use its images a tad manipulative, but I don&amp;#039;t see that as a problem, after all, the world&amp;#039;s most popular critical filmmaker Michael Moore has made a quite living out of giving coloured information. Sacrificio has some nice use of music (drum &amp;#039;n bass) and images (often grainy footage, flashy use of older footage), sometimes giving the film the look of a video clip. A very important film, that everyone with even only a passing interest in Cuba should see.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0282934/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0282934/&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\nWINNER OF THE 2001 INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL &quot; ITS ALL TRUE &quot; SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡o Paulo, Brazil\n\nSwedish !
