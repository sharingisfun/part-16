This is country music with a wink and a dry-as-West-Texas-dust sense of humor, but at heart, Lubbock (On Everything) is a thoughtful meditation on Allen's hometown. Recorded in Lubbock after Allen hadn't lived there for close to a decade with a small group headed by local legends Don Caldwell and Lloyd Maines, the songs alternate between biting character studies like &quot;Lubbock Woman&quot; and &quot;The Great Joe Bob (A Regional Tragedy),&quot; about a high school football star who ends up robbing a liquor store, and more loving tributes like &quot;The Thirty Years War&quot; and &quot;The Wolfman of Del Rio.&quot; Salted through are a handful of songs about the pretensions of the art world (something Allen knows well in his day job as a sculptor and painter) that help keep the album's more cutting lines from sounding mean-spirited. A 20-song masterpiece, Lubbock (On Everything) is essential listening for anyone with an interest in the outer fringes of country music.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a485dfa922e6c7a002438068371057f09d0067aa","amp;dn":"Terry+Allen+-+Lubbock+%28On+Everything%29+%5B1979%5D%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a485dfa922e6c7a002438068371057f09d0067aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,133,223,169,34,230,199,160,2,67,128,104,55,16,87,240,157,0,103,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
