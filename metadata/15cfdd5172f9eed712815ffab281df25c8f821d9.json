It was also the B-side of the number-one hit single &quot;Light My Fire&quot;. According to Doors drummer John Densmore it was a love song to Jim Morrison's former girlfriend, Mary Werbelow.\n\nIt has been suggested that the inspiration for the &quot;crystal ship&quot; image refers to Platform Holly, an oil rig off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, which glitters like a crystal ship when lit up at night and Jim Morrison was inspired by it one night on the beach.\n\nAmerican Bandstand is an American music-performance show that aired in various versions from 1952 to 1989 and was hosted from 1956 until its final season by Dick Clark, who also served as producer. The show featured teenagers dancing to Top 40 music introduced by Clark; at least one popular musical actÃ¢â‚¬â€over the decades, running the gamut from Jerry Lee Lewis to Run DMC would usually appear in person to lip-sync one of their latest singles.\n\n\nThe Doors were an American rock band formed in 1965 in Los Angeles, with vocalist Jim Morrison, keyboardist Ray Manzarek, drummer John Densmore and guitarist Robby Krieger. The band took its name from the title of Aldous Huxley's book The Doors of Perception, which itself was a reference to a William Blake quote: &quot;If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite.&quot; They were among the most controversial, influential and unique rock acts of the 1960s and beyond, mostly because of Morrison's wild, poetic lyrics and charismatic but unpredictable stage persona. After Morrison's death on 3 July 1971, aged 27, the remaining members continued as a trio until disbanding in 1973.\n\nAlthough the Doors' active career ended in 1973, their popularity has persisted. According to the RIAA, they have sold 36.6 million certified units in the US and over 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. The Doors has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by many magazines, including Rolling Stone, which ranked them 41st on its list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. The Doors were the first American band to accumulate eight consecutive gold and platinum LPs.\n\nThe Doors were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crystal_Ship&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crystal_Ship&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/fysrsmo03/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/fysrsmo03/&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 8242kbps\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD, 16 bits]\n   Duration: 00:02:38\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
