The comic tends to focus on the dichotomy between Icon's conservative Republican views and the lives of minorities within the city limits, especially the liberal views of other heroes including his sidekick Rocket, a teenage single mother \n \nHe has been featured in the DC Universe several times including the JLA twice and Superman\n\nI believe that this completes my Milestone uploads.  If there are any torrents with missing comics comment on my most recent torrent and I will fix the torrent.  This will take 2 days to UL but will be worth it.\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:062176e993aa55bc470fd6de2e8e9835b66f6ea8","amp;dn":"Icon+complete+%28Milestone%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"062176e993aa55bc470fd6de2e8e9835b66f6ea8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,33,118,233,147,170,85,188,71,15,214,222,46,142,152,53,182,111,110,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
