The feel of the album is much different than on The Family That Plays Together. It is more mature and foreshadows what they would do on their masterpiece, Dr. Sardonicus. Ice is one of their most jazz-influenced songs with a brilliant solo by Randy California and great key work by John Locke.\n\nThe addition of the single, 1984, is fantastic. It was originally banned from being played on the radio because it spoke of the government watching it's citizens, such as in the novel of the same name.\n\nClear demonstrates that Randy California was one of the most over looked great rock guitarists to come out of the late 1960's.\n\nR.I.P.
