We had a great concert. It was one of the finest we've had in California for a long time!&quot; \r\nsaid Plant as the band climbed the stage. Robert is powerful and the band rocks! Bonham's drumming is awesome throughout, and it really makes an impact during the first few numbers when the band plows through them with minimum pauses in between. No Quarter and Dazed And Confused are two great versions with lots of great improvisation. The jazzy groove of No Quarter, in particular, is spectacular.Trampled Underfoot was dedicated to the groupies as well: &quot;All the good ladies of America who've helped us get rid of the blues from time to time on the road...&quot;. Jimmy's solo in Stairway To Heaven is excellent","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30d929e07adc09a060d82f2598260d1dec22ed85","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1975.03.25+Los+Angeles%2C+California+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30d929e07adc09a060d82f2598260d1dec22ed85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,217,41,224,122,220,9,160,96,216,47,37,152,38,13,29,236,34,237,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
