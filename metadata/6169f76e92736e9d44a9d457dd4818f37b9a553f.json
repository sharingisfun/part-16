The other members of the group include (but are not limited to) Christopher Pellani - percussion, Peggy Baldwin - cello, and Laura Halliday - flute. All of these were established musicians well before the founding of the group and bring their skills to bear with rewarding results. Ostensibly &amp;#039;new age&amp;#039; in approach, the wander the spectrum from Medieval and Indian settings to Cat Stevens and the Beatles. \nThis album is something of a composite of previous work done for Windham Hill on signing on to that label. With everything from &amp;#039;borrowed&amp;#039; work like Cat Steven&amp;#039;s Sad Lisa to quirky cross-fertilizations of Celtic and Middle Eastern (A Chantar Mer) the professionalism and creativity are compelling and interesting. \nThis doesn&amp;#039;t prevent the album from seeming a bit overproduced and a tad monotonous. Tempos tend to be idyllic and restful, and the settings textural rather than melodic. All this is find, but can wear thin on repeated listening. Unless you are a bit of a new age, meditation music fan, and then the hypnotic effect is just fine. Even at worst, there is nothing to dislike in this album, which carries out its purpose admirably. \nFor more info: http://www.angelsofvenice.com/\n\nTracklist\n1. Sad Lisa    \n2. Lionheart    \n3.
