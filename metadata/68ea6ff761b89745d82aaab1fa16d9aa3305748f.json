KasherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s literate and heavily thematic songwriting style has won him numerous critical accolades, and the nine records he has released under the Cursive and Good Life banners have helped to cement his indie rock reputation both regionally and nationally. In 2009 Kasher left his Los Angeles home and hunkered down in a Whitefish, MT studio to record his debut solo album. Game of Monogamy, a self-penned, recorded, and produced collection of moody, intricate, orchestral indie pop, arrived on Saddle Creek the following year.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68ea6ff761b89745d82aaab1fa16d9aa3305748f","amp;dn":"Tim+Kasher+-+Adult+Film+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68ea6ff761b89745d82aaab1fa16d9aa3305748f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,234,111,247,97,184,151,69,216,42,170,177,250,22,217,170,51,5,116,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
