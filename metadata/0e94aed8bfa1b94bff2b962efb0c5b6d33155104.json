Later I started sharing them freely with the world to promote a more positive perception of martial arts. Also, I try to educate people as much as possible about martial arts, fitness, and health. There is a lot of crap info out there, and so much more good info. As such, I sifted through a lot of different articles and books, tried out many different exercises and routines, and took classes from different instructors. I distilled my experiences into what works and how to progress in martial arts and fitness. The files in this torrent are the result.
