Well, sort of. There are elements of Dance, Pop, and the standard ballads the singer/songwriter is primarily known for, but each song has the unmistakable sense of Funk and Soul. It could be argued that against the latest trend of club pumping heavy beats in today's music, this is what's missing. Spagna presents listeners with groove moving sound and well crafted lyrics. 'Upside Down' is immediately a stand out track, but besides, 'Listen To Your Heart', nothing else remains memorable at first listen.&quot;\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. I Know Why (Feat.
