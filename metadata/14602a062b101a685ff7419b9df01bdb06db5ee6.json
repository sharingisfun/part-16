From the vantage point \nof an insane asylum, aging royal composer Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) recalls \nthe events of three decades earlier, when the young Mozart (Tom Hulce) first \ngained favor in the court of Austrian emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones). \nSalieri was incensed that God would bless so vulgar and obnoxious a young \nsnipe as Mozart with divine genius. Why was Salieri so disciplined, so \ndevoted to his art, and so willing to toady to his superiors not touched by \nGod? Unable to match Mozart's talent, Salieri uses his influence in court \nto sabotage the young upstart's career. Disguising himself as a mysterious \nbenefactor, Salieri commissions the backbreaking Requiem, which eventually \ncosts Mozart his health, wealth, and life. Among the film's many pearls of \ndialogue, the best line goes to the emperor, who rejects a Mozart composition \non the grounds that it has too many notes. Amadeus won eight Academy Awards, \nincluding Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best \nActor for F. Murray Abraham. In 2002, the film received a theatrical \nre-release as Amadeus: The Director's Cut, a version that includes 20 \nminutes of additional footage.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-F Murray Abraham.\n=&gt;-Tom Hulce.\n=&gt;-Elizabeth Berridge.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Milos Forman.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Biography : Drama : Music.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1984.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 2.22 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 767 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 3h 00mn.\n=&gt;-Amadeus Directors Cut......: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086879/\n=&gt;-Amadeus Directors Cut......: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/amadeus/\n=&gt;-Amadeus Directors Cut......: http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-amadeus-1984/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.35:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 544.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1650 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 166 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14602a062b101a685ff7419b9df01bdb06db5ee6","amp;dn":"Amadeus+-+Directors+Cut+Biography+1984+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14602a062b101a685ff7419b9df01bdb06db5ee6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,96,42,6,43,16,26,104,95,247,65,155,157,240,27,219,6,219,94,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
