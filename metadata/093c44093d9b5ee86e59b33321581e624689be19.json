Defraggler lets you specify one or more files, folders, or the whole drive to defragment.\n\nWhen Defraggler reads or writes a file, it uses the exact same techniques that Windows uses. Using Defraggler is just as safe for your files as using Windows.\n\nAt a glance, you can see how fragmented your hard drive is. Defraggler's drive map shows you blocks that are empty, not fragmented, or needing defragmentation.\n\n    Give your hard drive a quick touch-up with Quick Defrag\n    Organizes empty disk space to further prevent fragmentation\n    Defragment while you sleep - and wake up with a faster PC. Set Defraggler to run daily, weekly or monthly\n    Full Windows OS and Multi-lingual support\n    Boot time defrag of system files\n    Supports 37 major languages\n\n\n\n\n\nComment and Seed :D\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:093c44093d9b5ee86e59b33321581e624689be19","amp;dn":"Defraggler+2.09.391","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"093c44093d9b5ee86e59b33321581e624689be19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,60,68,9,61,155,94,232,110,89,179,51,33,88,30,98,70,137,190,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
