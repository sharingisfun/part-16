Wyman\nCast: Joe Smith, Carolyn Adair, Karl Urban | \n\n.: Plot :.\nAlmost Human is an action-packed police procedural set 35 years in the future, when police officers are partnered with highly evolved human-like Combat-model Androids.\n\nThe year is 2048. Meet Detective John Kennex, a cop who survived one of the most catastrophic attacks ever made against the police department. After waking up from a 17-month coma, he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t remember much Ã¢â‚¬â€ except that his partner was killed, he lost one of his legs and he is now outfitted with a highly sophisticated synthetic appendage.\n\nBy mandate, every cop must partner with a robot. And despite his passionate aversion to androids, John is paired up with Dorian, a discontinued android with unexpected emotional responses. Although such responses were deemed flaws, it is in these &quot;flaws&quot; that John relates to Dorian most. After all, John is part-machine now, and Dorian is part-human. John and DorianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s understanding of each other not only complements them, it connects them.\n\nAlmost Human will follow the week-to-week missions of John and Dorian, as they fight crime across this futuristic landscape, while the mysteries surrounding JohnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attack and the larger mythology of this new world unfold.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0869022d434ac345d710e507d6d434144d03e07","amp;dn":"Almost.Human.S01E03.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0869022d434ac345d710e507d6d434144d03e07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,134,144,34,212,52,172,52,93,113,14,80,125,109,67,65,68,208,62,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
