It's a misconception that 'quality costs money' as a poor quality product or service will ultimately cost you more.\n\nWhether you're starting out in business or have been trading for a number of years, 'Quality Is Everything'. Unless a prospective client already knows you or you already have an established reputation, trying to gain new clients can be a difficult task, especially in today's climate of competition.\n\nTo give yourself the best chance to win that new client, you must show that you're not only equally as good as your competition but BETTER, much better in fact!\n\nIn this course we will be looking at the history of quality management over the past two hundred years and how it has evolved to become an International Standard, the ISO9001. We will be defining 'Quality' and 'Quality Management' to better understand how we can achieve these requirements for our clients.\nWe will be looking at the ISO9001 and specifically Clause 4 that deals with what needs to be included in a QMS (Quality Management System) and working through a 'Quality Manual' template that I provide so at the end of the course you will be well on your way to having your own Quality Management System.\n\nFinally we will be looking how to implement your QMS and continual improvement so that you get the most out of Quality Management and ultimately achieve your business goals.\n\nIf your company or professional body requires you to complete Continuing Professional Development (CPD) or Continuing Professional Education (CPE), then this course will constitute half a days 'training'.\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
