It's a fascinating look at the life and career of a musician who blazed his own trail and challenged fans and peers to keep up with his whims and desires. \nThe book naturally begins with Neil's birth in Toronto in 1945 to Scott and Edna Young. Readers are presented portraits of the artist as a young man as far back as when he was two years old. Family and school photos reveal a kid no different from any other. Though there is one prophetic picture, of course impossible to know at the time, associated with his junior high school graduation that finds Neil more focused on the guitar in his hands than the woman on his lap. \nNeil ages before our eyes as the pages are flipped through, telling not only his story but also a good portion of rock 'n' roll's as well. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95d9f57fe72f3ea82d8e406b4b9ae7dce6fc0511","amp;dn":"Neil+Young+Long+May+You+Run+The+Illustrated+History+%28epub%29%5Broger","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95d9f57fe72f3ea82d8e406b4b9ae7dce6fc0511","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,217,245,127,231,47,62,168,45,142,64,107,75,154,231,220,230,252,5,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
