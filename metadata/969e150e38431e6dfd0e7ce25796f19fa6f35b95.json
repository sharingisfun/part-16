The authors emphasize how we know what we know in the figures, text, and end-of-chapter material.\n\nAbout the Authors\nLaura Kay is Ann Whitney Olin professor and chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Barnard College, where she has taught since 1991. She received a BS degree in physics from Stanford University, and MS and PhD degrees in astronomy and astrophysics from the University of CaliforniaÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Santa Cruz. She teaches courses in astronomy, astrobiology, women and science, and polar exploration.\nStacy Palen received her bachelor's degree from Rutgers University in 1993 and her PhD from the University of Iowa in 1998. Currently, she is an Associate Professor at Weber State University in Ogden, Utah. She lives on a small farm with her husband, two dogs, two dairy goats, four horses, and an ever-changing number of chickens.\nBradford Smith, who studies solar system cosmogony and stellar astronomy, is affiliated with the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii.\nGeorge Blumenthal is professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He studies a wide range of topics including cosmology, dark matter, and the origin of structure in the Universe. \n\nBRIEF CONTENTS\nPart I Introduction to Astronomy\nChapter 1 Why Learn Astronomy? 3\nChapter 2 Patterns in the SkyÃ¢â‚¬â€Motions of Earth 25\nChapter 3 Motion of Astronomical Bodies 63\nChapter 4 Gravity and Orbits 89\nChapter 5 Light 117\nChapter 6 The Tools of the Astronomer 151\nPart II The Solar System\nChapter 7 The Birth and Evolution of Planetary Systems 185\nChapter 8 The Terrestrial Planets and EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Moon 215\nChapter 9 Atmospheres of the Terrestrial Planets 257\nChapter 10 Worlds of Gas and LiquidÃ¢â‚¬â€The Giant Planets 291\nChapter 11 Planetary AdornmentsÃ¢â‚¬â€Moons and Rings 323\nChapter 12 Dwarf Planets and Small Solar System Bodies 359\nPart III Stars and Stellar Evolution\nChapter 13 Taking the Measure of Stars 395\nChapter 14 Our StarÃ¢â‚¬â€The Sun 427\nChapter 15 Star Formation and the Interstellar Medium 459\nChapter 16 Evolution of Low-Mass Stars 491\nChapter 17 Evolution of High-Mass Stars 521\nChapter 18 Relativity and Black Holes 551\nPart IV Galaxies, the Universe, and Cosmology\nChapter 19 The Expanding Universe 581\nChapter 20 Galaxies 611\nChapter 21 The Milky WayÃ¢â‚¬â€A Normal Spiral Galaxy 641\nChapter 22 Modern Cosmology 667\nChapter 23 Large-Scale Structure in the Universe 695\nChapter 24 Life 723","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:969e150e38431e6dfd0e7ce25796f19fa6f35b95","amp;dn":"21st+Century+Astronomy+%28Full+4th+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"969e150e38431e6dfd0e7ce25796f19fa6f35b95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,158,21,14,56,67,30,109,253,14,124,226,87,150,241,159,166,243,91,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
