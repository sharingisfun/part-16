Through the use of cross-sectional imaging modalities, including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and positron emission tomography, it depicts normal anatomy as well as common gynecological tumors. For each type of cancer, aspects such as primary staging, recurrence patterns, and findings from different yet complementary imaging modalities are explored. Atlas of Gynecologic Oncology Imaging presents a coherent perspective of the roles of standard and cutting-edge imaging techniques in gynecologic oncology via a multidisciplinary approach to cancer care. Featuring over 600 images, this book is a valuable resource for diagnostic radiologists, radiation oncologists, and gynecologists.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcee332e6bc3d99c58abf56aec0049dce7034045","amp;dn":"Atlas+of+Gynecologic+Oncology+Imaging+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcee332e6bc3d99c58abf56aec0049dce7034045","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,238,51,46,107,195,217,156,88,171,245,106,236,0,73,220,231,3,64,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
