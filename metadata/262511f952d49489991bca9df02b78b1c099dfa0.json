Rhyne (born October 12, 1936, Indianapolis, Indiana), a largely self-taught pianist, was an important part of the city's jazz scene. He played with the then-unknown Roland Kirk during 1955-1956, and soon switched to organ. He also had opportunities to back a series of blues (including T-Bone Walker and B.B. King) and R&amp;B artists. Rhyne was part of Montgomery's group for most of 1959-1964. In 1969, he moved to Madison, WI, and four years later he relocated to Milwaukee, where he remained active if obscure for the next two decades. In 1990, he emerged, recording with Herb Ellis and Brian Lynch. Mel Rhyne went on with more recording sessions and has shown that he is an excellent soul-jazz and hard bop organist in his own right.\n\n\nList of included albums:\n\n1959 Wes Montgomery - A Dynamic New Sound\n1960 Mel Rhyne - Organ-izing\n1963 Wes Montgomery - Boss Guitar\n1963 Wes Montgomery - Portrait Of Wes\n1963 Wes Montgomery - Guitar On The Go\n1991 Herb Ellis - Roll Call\n1994 Melvin Rhyne - The Legend\n1994 Melvin Rhyne - Boss Organ\n1996 Melvin Rhyne - Mel's Spell\n1999 Melvin Rhyne - Kojo\n1999 Melvin Rhyne - Classmasters\n2003 Melvin Rhyne - Tomorrow Yesterday Today\n2006 Melvin Rhyne - Front &amp; Center\n\n1996 Wes Montgomery With Melvin Rhyne\n'Wes Montgomery With Melvin Rhyne' is a compilation album with selected tracks from the other Montgomery records included.\n\n----------\n\nMP3 format.
