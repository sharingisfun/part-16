Blue Moon Swamp is full of the straight-ahead roots-rock that made Creedence a legend. It's rumored that the recording of this album was painstakingly slow, with Fogerty spending months to get the right drum and guitar sound for each track. It's the mark of a true craftsman that for all it's intensive production and the large cast of guests, Blue Moon Swamp still sounds like Fogerty just ambled into the studio with a few pals and laid it all down.\n\nWhile there are a few stylistic diversions, like the Tex-Mex-flavored &quot;Bring It Down To Jelly Roll,&quot; the bulk of the material is virtually identical in approach and tone to that of Fogerty's glory days. The amazing thing is that he never sounds tired or stale. If anything, he sounds more self-assured and powerful than on his previous solo outings. When Fogerty trots out the tremolo-guitar intro to &quot;A Hundred And Ten In The Shade,&quot; you can feel the pure, blues-inflected rock and roll inspiration that lies at the heart of his finest work.\n\n\nTracklist\n1Southern Streamline3:56 \n2Hot Rod Heart3:26 \n3Blueboy4:04 \n4Hundred and Ten in the Shade, A4:19 \n5Rattlesnake Highway4: \n6Bring It Down to Jelly Roll2:37 \n7Walking in a Hurricane3: \n8Swamp River Days 3:37 \n9Rambunctious Boy 3:52 \n10Joy of My Life3:52 \n11Blue Moon Nights2:33 \n12Bad Bad Boy4: 26\n\nPersonnel: John Fogerty (vocals, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, lap steel guitar, dobro, bouzouki, mandolin, sitar, organ, tambourine); Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn, Howie Epstein, John Clayton, Michael Rhodes , Phil Chen, Bob Glaub (bass instrument); Kenny Aronoff (drums, percussion); Chester Thompson , Jeff Donavan, Eddie Bayers, Chad Smith , Vinnie Colaiuta (drums); Luis Conte (claves, maracas, tambourine, percussion).\n\nThe Waters: Julia Waters, Maxine Waters, Oren Waters (background vocals).\n\nThe Fairfield Four includes: James Hill, Isaac Freeman (background vocals).\n\nThe Lonesome River Band: Ronnie Bowman, Don Rigsby, Kenny Smith (background vocals).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b33eedb58817ec35f178a8486a776b5e23388adb","amp;dn":"John+Fogerty+Blue+Moon+Swamp%28rock%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b33eedb58817ec35f178a8486a776b5e23388adb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,62,237,181,136,23,236,53,241,120,168,72,106,119,107,94,35,56,138,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
