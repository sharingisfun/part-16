The&quot; New York Times&quot; said that &quot;Real Food&quot; poses a convincing alternative to the prevailing dietary guidelines, even those treated as gospel.\r\n\r\nA rebuttal to dietary fads and a clarion call for the return to old-fashioned foods, &quot;Real Food&quot; no longer seems radical, if only because the conversation has caught up to Nina Planck. Indeed, it has become gospel in its own right.\r\n\r\nThis special tenth-anniversary edition includes a foreword by Nina Teicholz (&quot;The Big Fat Surprise&quot;) and a new introduction from the author.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71717f78368c1f8b8887d4e7e4f44447f3a09fdb","amp;dn":"Real+Food+-+What+to+Eat+and+Why+%282016%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71717f78368c1f8b8887d4e7e4f44447f3a09fdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,113,127,120,54,140,31,139,136,135,212,231,228,244,68,71,243,160,159,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
