With a live audience mumbling in the background and a super-swinging rhythm section of Red Mitchell and Donald Bailey and a technical master at the piano: Hampton. Recorded in LA in 1966, this is a beautiful trio album. Every tune is lively and full of brilliant dialogue between Hampton and his band. ~ Ahmed Chronwell\n\nPersonnel:\nHampton Hawes (p)\nRed Mitchell (b)\nDonald Bailey (d)\n\nHampton Hawes Trio - The Seance Tracks:\n01  The Seance \n02  Oleo \n03  Easy Street \n04  Suddenly I Thought Of You \n05  For Heaven's Sake \n06  My Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4409472eebc3f229b7090b07e28ee7fc7fc29bf8","amp;dn":"Hampton+Hawes+Trio+-+The+Seance+%281966%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4409472eebc3f229b7090b07e28ee7fc7fc29bf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,9,71,46,235,195,242,41,183,9,11,7,226,142,231,252,127,194,155,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
