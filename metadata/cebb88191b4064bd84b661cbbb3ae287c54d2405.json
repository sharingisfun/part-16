He was noted for the strict artistry with which he carried on the classical Russian traditions in the writing of prose and poetry. The texture of his poems and stories, sometimes referred to as &quot;Bunin brocade&quot;, is considered to be one of the richest in the language.\n\nBunin is rarely read any more in the English-speaking world. The Introduction to the Hettlinger collection suggests this is because of the difficulty conveying the subtleties of Bunin's language. I haven't read much of Bunin, but my impression is that Hettlinger may be among the best places to start. But I've read a few stories from the Dark Avenues volume in this torrent, and loved them.\n\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise indicated:\n\n* COLLECTED STORIES (Ivan R. Dee, 2007). Translated by Graham Hettlinger. This is a selection of Bunin's stories, not a true &quot;complete&quot; collection. \n\n* CURSED DAYS: DIARY OF A REVOLUTION (Ivan R. Dee, 1988). Translated by Thomas Gaiton Marullo. Many thanks to workerbee for this one. (EPUB, PDF)\n\n* DARK AVENUES AND OTHER STORIES (Hyperion, 1977; first published 1949). Translated by Richard Hare. \n\n* THE DREAMS OF CHANG AND OTHER STORIES (Knopf, 1923). Translated by Bernard Guilbert Guerney.\n\n* THE ELAGHIN AFFAIR AND OTHER STORIES (Knopf, 1935). Translated by Bernard Guilbert Guerney.\n\n* THE GENTLEMAN FROM SAN FRANCISCO AND OTHER STORIES (Penguin Classics, 1984). Translated by David Richards and Sophie Lund. (EPUB)\n\n* THE GENTLEMAN FROM SAN FRANCISCO AND OTHER STORIES (Hogarth Press, 1922). Translated by S.S. Koteliansky, Leonard Woolf, and D.H. Lawrence. This book does not have the same stories, apart from the title story, as the previous book in this list.\n\n* MEMORIES AND PORTRAITS (Doubleday, 1951). Translated by Vera Traill and Robin Chancellor.\n\n* NIGHT OF DENIAL: STORIES AND NOVELLAS (Northwestern Univ. Press, 2006). Translated by Robert Bowie.\n\n* STORIES AND POEMS (Progress Publishers, 1979). Translated by Olga Shartse and Irina Zheleznova.\n\n* THE VILLAGE (Martin Secker, 1923). Translated by Isabel Hapgood.\n\n* THE WELL OF DAYS (Knopf, 1934). Translated by Gleb Struve and Hamish Miles.\n\n* WOLVES AND OTHER LOVE STORIES (Capra Press, 1989).
