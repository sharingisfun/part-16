Statistics\n\n\nPreface\n\nWelcome\n\nThe goals of this book, the third edition of Mathematica Navigator: Mathematics, Statistics, \n\nGraphics, and\nProgramming, are as follows:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ´Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½to introduce the reader to Mathematica; and\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ´Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½to emphasize mathematics (especially methods of applied mathematics), statistics, \n\ngraphics,\nprogramming, and writing mathematical documents.\nAccordingly, we navigate the reader through Mathematica and give an overall introduction. \n\nOften we\nslow down somewhat when an important or interesting topic of mathematics or statistics is \n\nencountered\nto investigate it in more detail. We then often use both graphics and symbolic and numerical \n\nmethods.\nHere and there we write small programs to make the use of some procedures easier. One \n\nchapter is\ndevoted to Mathematica as an advanced environment of writing mathematical documents.\nThe online version of the book, which can be installed from the enclosed CD-ROM, makes the\nmaterial easily available when working with Mathematica.\nChanges in this third edition are numerous and are explained later in the Preface. The \n\ncurrent edition\nis based on Mathematica 6. On the CD-ROM, there is material that describes the new \n\nproperties of\nMathematica 7.\n\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¡ Readership\n\nThe book may be useful in the following situations:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ´Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½for courses teaching Mathematica;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ´Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½for several mathematical and statistical courses (given in, for example, mathematics, \n\nengineering,\nphysics, and statistics); and\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ´Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½for self-study.\nIndeed, the book may serve as a tutorial and as a reference or handbook of Mathematica, and \n\nit may\nalso be useful as a companion in many mathematical and statistical courses, including the \n\nfollowing:\ndifferential and integral calculus ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ linear algebra ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ optimization ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ differential, partial \n\ndifferential,\nand difference equations ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ engineering mathematics ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ mathematical methods of physics ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\nmathematical modeling ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ numerical methods ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ probability ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ stochastic processes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ statistics \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\nregression analysis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Bayesian statistics\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¡ Previous Knowledge\n\nNo previous knowledge of Mathematica is assumed. On the other hand, we assume some knowledge \n\nof\nvarious topics in pure and applied mathematics. We study, for example, partial differential \n\nequations\nand statistics without giving detailed introductions to these topics. If you are not \n\nacquainted with a\ntopic, you can simply skip the chapter or section of the book considering that topic.\nAlso, to understand the numerical algorithms, it is useful if the reader has some knowledge \n\nabout the\nsimplest numerical methods. Often we introduce briefly the basic ideas of a method (or they \n\nmay\nbecome clear from the examples or other material presented), but usually we do not derive \n\nthe methods.\nIf a topic is unfamiliar to you, consult a textbook about numerical analysis, such as Skeel \n\nand Keiper\n(2001).\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¡ Recommendations\n\nIf you are a newcomer to Mathematica, then Chapter 1, Starting, is mandatory, and Chapter 2, \n\nSightseeing,\nis strongly recommended. You can also browse Chapter 3, Notebooks, and perhaps also Chapter \n\n4,\nFiles, so that you know where to go when you encounter the topics of these chapters. After \n\nthat you can\nproceed more freely. However, read Section 13.1, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBasic Techniques,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ because it contains \n\nsome very\ncommon concepts used constantly for expressions.\nIf you have some previous knowledge of Mathematica, you can probably go directly to the \n\nchapter or\nsection you are interested in, with the risk, however, of having to go back to study some \n\nbackground\nmaterial. Again, be sure to read Section 13.1.\n\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¡ Introduction, Files, Graphics, Data, Dynamics, Expressions, and Programs\n\nThe first two chapters introduce Mathematica and give a short overview.\nThe next two chapters consider files, particularly files created by Mathematica, which are \n\ncalled\nnotebooks. We show how Mathematica can be used to write mathematical documents. We also \n\nexplain\nhow to load packages, how to export and import data and graphics into and from Mathematica, \n\nand how\nto manage memory and computing time. You may skip these two chapters until you need them.\nThen we go on to graphics. One of the finest aspects of Mathematica is its high-quality \n\ngraphics, and\none of the strongest motivations for studying Mathematica is to learn to illustrate \n\nmathematics with\nfigures. We consider separately graphics for functions and graphics for data. In addition, \n\nwe have\nchapters about graphics primitives and graphics options.\nNew in Mathematica 6 are the built-in data sources, covering topics such as chemistry, \n\nastronomy,\nparticles, countries, cities, finance, polyhedrons, graphs, words, and colors.\nThe main new topic in Mathematica 6 is dynamics. This allows us to easily build interactive \n\ninterfaces.\nThe user of such an interface can choose some parameters or other options and the output \n\nwill be\nchanged dynamically, in real time. This helps in studying various models and phenomena.\nThen we study various types of expressions, from numbers to strings, mathematical \n\nexpressions,\nlists, tables, and patterns.\nWe have two chapters relating to programming. The first studies functions and the next \n\nvarious\nstyles of programming. Four styles are considered: procedural, functional, rule-based, and \n\nrecursive.\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¡ Mathematics and Statistics\n\nIn the remaining 12 chapters, we study different areas of pure and applied mathematics and \n\nstatistics.\nThe mathematical chapters can be divided into four classes, with each class containing \n\nchapters of more\nor less related topics. Descriptions of these classes follow.\nTopics of traditional differential and integral calculus include derivatives, Taylor series, \n\nlimits,\nintegrals, sums, and transforms.\nThen we consider vectors and matrices; linear, polynomial, and transcendental equations; and \n\nglobal,\nlocal, and classical optimization.\nIn interpolation we have the usual interpolating polynomial, a piecewise-calculated \n\ninterpolating\npolynomial, and splines. In approximation we distinguish the approximation of data and \n\nfunctions. For\nthe former, we can use the linear or nonlinear least-squares method, whereas for the latter \n\nwe have, for\nexample, minimax approximation.\nMathematica solves differential equations both symbolically and numerically. We can solve \n\nfirst- and\nhigher-order equations, systems of equations, and initial and boundary value problems. For \n\npartial\ndifferential equations, we show how some equations can be solved symbolically, how to handle \n\nseries\nsolutions, and how to numerically solve problems with the method of lines or with the finite \n\ndifference\nmethod. Then we consider difference equations. For linear difference equations, we can \n\npossibly find a\nsolution in a closed form, but most nonlinear difference equations have to be investigated \n\nin other ways,\nsuch as studying trajectories and forming bifurcation diagrams.\nLastly, we study probability and statistics. Mathematica contains information about most of \n\nthe\nwell-known probability distributions. Simulation of various random phenomena (e.g., \n\nstochastic\nprocesses) is done well with random numbers. Statistical topics include descriptive \n\nstatistics, frequencies,\nconfidence intervals, hypothesis testing, regression, smoothing, and Bayesian statistics.\n\n\nSEED PLEASE, SEED PLEASE\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:894524d8febd91ccc62ce40f13d3e2031d2332a1","amp;dn":"Mathematica+Navigator+2009+3rd+Edition+%5Bgodsogood%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"894524d8febd91ccc62ce40f13d3e2031d2332a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,69,36,216,254,189,145,204,198,44,228,15,19,211,226,3,29,35,50,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
