The Pipe of the prophecy has fallen into the evil hands of the goblins, propelling the world into a whirlwind of disorder. The ancient Taoist wizards turn to the greatest ascetics of their time, the Master and Hwadam (Kim Yoon-seok) for help in vanquishing the goblins and trust each wizard with one half of the Pipe. Meanwhile, the MasterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rascal student Woochi (Kang Dong-won) tricks the king with the art of transformation and creates a fiasco, which makes the three Taoist wizards and Hwadam visit the Master. But the Master has been murdered and his half of the Pipe is missing! By taking his masterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pipe out to the market streets, Woochi has been pushed into a corner, ultimately getting sealed into a painting along with his trusty dog, Chorangyi (Yoo Hae-jin)\n\n\n&quot;WOOCHI&quot; sets box office record on opening day","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06306cb205c4b7b972b756e3f7ed9ae3161c1288","amp;dn":"JEON+WOO+CHI+The+Taoist+Wizard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06306cb205c4b7b972b756e3f7ed9ae3161c1288","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,48,108,178,5,196,183,185,114,183,86,227,247,237,154,227,22,28,18,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
