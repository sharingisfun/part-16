But what if a weapon was discharged that, in addition to all the above, also erased people's memories? Would mankind, given a fresh start, continue on its path to self-destruction? Or would it, free of its preconceptions, usher in a new age of peace? Amnesia explores what might happen if someone were to push the restart button on the human race.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37a9e6a685cdea526e6420768bda1da4051d031d","amp;dn":"Amnesia+%28Arcana+Studios%29+%5BGraphic+Novel%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37a9e6a685cdea526e6420768bda1da4051d031d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,169,230,166,133,205,234,82,110,100,32,118,139,218,29,164,5,29,3,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
