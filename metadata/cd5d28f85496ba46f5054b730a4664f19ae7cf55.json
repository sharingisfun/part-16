This title is part of the highly successful &quot;Diviniti Publishing Hypnosis&quot; range, which is now well established as the UK&amp;#039;s best selling self help audio range.It is a complete myth that memory deteriorates with age. This high quality CD will help you develop a powerful memory that gets stronger all the time by using skilled hypnotherapy techniques. This CD can be used for any type of exam preparation, or to improve concentration and generally develop a stronger memory. On both hypnotherapy sessions you will hear a pleasant English voice and absorbing 60 bpm sound effects guiding you into a deeply relaxed state of mental and physical relaxation. In this very receptive relaxed state, you will be given a number of post hypnotic suggestions and carefully layered affirmations to help you store and recall information more easily. The background echoed affirmations pan from left to right in your headphones.\n\nThis deeply relaxing method of delivering multiple suggestions simultaneously to the unconscious mind can facilitate positive changes very quickly.At the end of each track you will be gently brought back to full waking consciousness with a combination of suggestion and music. There are also a number of positive subliminal suggestions (listed on the inside cover), which are embedded in the fade out music to facilitate the overall effect. This powerful CD gives you a completely safe and very effective way of developing a powerful memory.\n\n\nVisit http://prince213.blogspot.com/ for more...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd5d28f85496ba46f5054b730a4664f19ae7cf55","amp;dn":"Glenn+Harold+-+Develop+A+Powerful+Memory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd5d28f85496ba46f5054b730a4664f19ae7cf55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,93,40,248,84,150,186,70,245,5,75,115,10,70,100,241,154,231,207,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
