The story revolves around Power, who is in love with Gardner&amp;#039;s character but has been rendered impotent by a war injury, and Gardner, who is promiscuous yet engaged to Flynn&amp;#039;s character, who is a heavy drinker with a bad temper.  All this happens during 1920&amp;#039;s Paris, with a trip to Papaloma for the running of the bulls.\n\nThe main criticism I saw in every review was the cast.  The players in Hemingway&amp;#039;s novel are in their 20&amp;#039;s, part of the &amp;#039;live fast die young&amp;#039; crowd who lost their innocence after the brutality of WWI.  The cast members are a good 10-20 years past the age of Hemingway&amp;#039;s characters - Power was 44, Gardner was 35, and Flynn 48.  The acting and direction was given fairly good reviews, however, the movie was made a little less believable by the poor character casting.\n\nThis film was one of the first widescreen movies, filmed in Cinemascope.\nDVD&gt;DivX/512x224/783bps/23.976fps/mp3/48KHz/117kbs/130min/850MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f06bc32149551d9353b4db17842292c760b8b34f","amp;dn":"The+Sun+Also+Rises++%281957%29++DVD%3EDivX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f06bc32149551d9353b4db17842292c760b8b34f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,107,195,33,73,85,29,147,83,180,219,23,132,34,146,199,96,184,179,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
