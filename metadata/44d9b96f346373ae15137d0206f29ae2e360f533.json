His debut album Grace became one of the most acclaimed and influential albums of his generation. To promote the album, Jeff and his band embarked a seemingly un-ending tour - taking them all over the globe from 1994 to 1996. Because the album had no &quot;hit single&quot;, Jeff was constantly tinkering with his setlists - both on stage and on TV. He therefore performed almost every track from Grace at least once in his many appearances on local broadcasts around the globe. Now, for the first time, the very best of those performances have been tracked down and compiled into the definitive audio/visual document of the Grace world tour.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44d9b96f346373ae15137d0206f29ae2e360f533","amp;dn":"Jeff+Buckley+-+Grace+Around+The+World+%5Bmp3-320-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44d9b96f346373ae15137d0206f29ae2e360f533","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,217,185,111,52,99,115,174,21,19,125,2,6,242,154,226,227,96,245,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
