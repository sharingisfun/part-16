I did not use any noise reduction or equalization on the rip, so this is exactly how it sounds. This album has only been played 3 times since it was given to me back in the mid 70's, once by my cousin and She bought it brand new and the other by me when I copied to audio tape back when I first received it, any pops you hear are few. Its been sitting in my collection until now and ripped for CD. This is a side1 and side2 rip with no track separations keeping the live continuity going. I have included along with the Flac the MP3 and some scans of the cover and LP sides.\n \nEnjoy fellow Led Zeppelin Lovers.\n \nTo the sunny hills of long ago!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db1174c746022b293e9353e58e35957757962014","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin++Bootleg++Mudslide++from+Orange+Vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db1174c746022b293e9353e58e35957757962014","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,17,116,199,70,2,43,41,62,147,83,229,142,53,149,119,87,150,32,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
