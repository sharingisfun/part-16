But what if the traditional measures of national status are no longer as important as they once were? What if AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s well-being was assessed according to entirely different factors?\n\n In The Upside of Down, Charles Kenny argues that AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so-called decline is only relative to the newfound success of other countries. And there is tremendous upside to life in a wealthier world: Americans can benefit from better choices and cheaper prices offered by schools and hospitals in rising countries, and, without leaving home, avail themselves of the new inventions and products those countries will produce. The key to thriving in this world is to move past the jeremiads about AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deteriorating status and figure out how best to take advantage of its new role in a multipolar world. A refreshing antidote to prophecies of American decline, The Upside of Down offers a fresh and highly optimistic look at AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s future in a wealthier world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20c500b5f20fbd674ca6df81699ca3bc236c0e4c","amp;dn":"The+Upside+of+Down%3A+Why+the+Rise+of+the+Rest+%282014%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20c500b5f20fbd674ca6df81699ca3bc236c0e4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,197,0,181,242,15,189,103,76,166,223,129,105,156,163,188,35,108,14,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
