Designed as a sampler for casual listeners, and with a greater focus on the band's career highlights rather than their hit singles, it is Blur's second retrospective collection, succeeding 2000's Blur: The Best Of and coincides with the band's 2009 reunion performances. \nSpanning the breadth of Blur's recorded history from its inception, Midlife: A Beginner's Guide to Blur features a larger sampling of material from 1993's Modern Life Is Rubbish (including the single-only &quot;Popscene&quot; from the same era) than on Blur: The Best Of, in addition to material from 2003's Think Tank, Blur's most recent studio release. \nAll songs written by Blur, except Out of Time and Good Song written by Damon Albarn/Alex James/Dave Rowntree..\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Beetlebum\n[02] Girls &amp; Boys\n[03] For Tomorrow\n[04] Coffee &amp; TV\n[05] Out Of Time\n[06] Blue Jeans\n[07] Song 2\n[08] Bugman\n[09] He Thought Of Cars\n[10] Death Of A Party\n[11] The Universal\n[12] Sing\n[13] This Is A Low\n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 00h:58m:83s\n\nCD-02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Tender\n[02] She's So High\n[03] Chemical World\n[04] Good Song\n[05] Parklife\n[06] Advert\n[07] Popscene\n[08] Stereotypes\n[09] Trimm Trubb\n[10] Badhead\n[11] Strange News From Another Star\n[12] Battery In Your Leg\n\n\tCD-02 Play Time - 00h:48m:15s\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time............. 01h:47m:13s\nTotal File Size................. 257mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate................
