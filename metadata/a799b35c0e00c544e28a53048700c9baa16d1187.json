If it's too bright, turn the brightness down and you'll see a lot more detail.\n\nStarring:\n- Alec Guinness   -   Father Quixote\n- Leo McKern  -   Sancho Zancas\n- Ian Richardson   -   Bishop of Motopo\n- Graham Crowden   -   The Bishop\n- Rosalie Crutchley   -   Teresa the housekeeper\n\n\nIn this modern adaptation of the Don Quixote theme, Father Quixote is an old Spanish village priest who travels through Spain with his friend Sancho, the village's mayor, and his car 'Rosinante'.  On their way he has to master the same adventures as his ancestor.  Based on the novel of the same name by Graham Greene.\n\nDid you know both Alec Guiness and his wife actually became fervent Catholics almost fifty years before his death in 2000, following an interesting incident while acting in Father Brown?  See the included pages.\n\n\nThis took me a year to download, so please seed!\nThere's also an even better copy below, on the eDonkey network.  I recommend using eMule 0.50a:\ned2k://|file|Monsignor.Quixote.(1985).Xvid.1.02.By.Wolfman.avi|1469790208|0370CBBABF2B11F8BF3DB800D0F29563|/\n\nSo far, I've managed to get 66% of this superior copy.  I'll upload it if I ever do get it.  If someone else manages to get it before me, please upload it and let me know.....:^)\n\n\nEnjoy - Cheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a799b35c0e00c544e28a53048700c9baa16d1187","amp;dn":"Monsignor+Quixote+%281987%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a799b35c0e00c544e28a53048700c9baa16d1187","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,153,179,92,14,0,197,68,226,138,83,4,135,0,201,186,161,109,17,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
