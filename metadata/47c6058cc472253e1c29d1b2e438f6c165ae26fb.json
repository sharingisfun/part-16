The group presented big band renditions of Phil Collins and Genesis songs, including hits such as &quot;Sussudio&quot; and &quot;Invisible Touch&quot;. The group was primarily an instrumental act, with Collins remaining behind the drums, like the early days of Genesis and rarely singing at performances.\n\nThe group released one album, A Hot Night in Paris, in 1999.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47c6058cc472253e1c29d1b2e438f6c165ae26fb","amp;dn":"The+Phil+Collins+Big+Band-A+Hot+Night+In+Paris-1999","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47c6058cc472253e1c29d1b2e438f6c165ae26fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,198,5,140,196,114,37,62,28,41,209,178,228,56,246,193,101,174,38,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
