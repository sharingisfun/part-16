With work ranging from splayed but lyrical noise, florid acoustic arrangements, and guitar-centric psychedelia, he and his bandmates have covered a vast musical territory that blurs the line between pop and experimentalism. But while Panda Bear and Animal Collective have garnered acclaim with each successive sonic venture, their music really started to take hold when they began working with electronics. In 2007, Lennox released the milestone Person Pitch, a mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lange of loopy samples, ethereal textures, and dubby echoesall bound together by his soulful tenor. Hailed by many as an instant classic, the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s influence was almost immediately recognizable. He continued work with Animal Collective, releasing another landmark album Merriweather Post Pavilion in 2009.\n\nWhile the interval since Person Pitch has seen plenty of work from the Animal Collective camp, Panda Bear activity has been rare. He has toured sparingly, done intermittent remix work, and appeared on a few peersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ releases while rumors circulated about his next full-length, Tomboy. The second half of 2010 saw the recordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first offerings: a string of 7&quot;s containing tracks from the album, each released on a different label. With one more due before the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s release on April 12th, the singles have revealed TomboyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s palette while helping Lennox gauge his progress and focus on individual songs.\n\nRecorded at his studio in Lisbon, Tomboy sees Lennox stepping away from the sample-based parameters of his previous record and incorporating more guitar and synthesizer. Still prevalent, though, is the interest in texture that made Person Pitch such a dense record; crashing waves and cheering crowds bounce against the gurgling arpeggios and give the tracks an immense sense of space. Soaked in reverb and punctuated with inflections of delay, the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s drums reveal a dub influence which gives them a visceral punch that lingers after each hit. LennoxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lofty, self-harmonizing vocals smooth out the songs, and Sonic BoomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mixing gives the work a large dynamic range. With Tomboy, Lennox has created a more plaintive atmosphere, but in accordance with the conflicting image of its title, the highs of the album balance out its lows. The record, massive in its span of emotion, genre, and sound, is the welcome return of one of the most prolific and consistent audio pioneers in recent memory.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.paw-tracks.com/tomboypresspage.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.paw-tracks.com/tomboypresspage.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomboy_%28album%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomboy_%28album%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo:\n\n- - North American Press by Forcefield PR\n\n- - North American College Radio Promotion by Terrorbird\n\n- - LP comes with digital download card\n\n\n\n- - Highly anticipated follow-up to 2007ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Person Pitch, voted #1 album of that year by Pitchfork.\n\n- - Panda Bear, one fourth of Animal Collective, presents his fourth full length album.\n\n- - Mixed by Pete Kember (A.K.A.
