Uriah Heep's progressive/art rock/heavy metal fusion's distinctive features have always included a massive keyboard sound, strong vocal harmonies and (in the early years) David Byron's quasi-operatic vocals. Twelve of the band's albums have made it to the UK Albums Chart (Return to Fantasy reached No. 7 in 1975) while of the fifteen Billboard 200 Uriah Heep albums Demons and Wizards was the most successful (#23, 1972). In the late 1970s the band had massive success in Germany, where the &quot;Lady in Black&quot; single was a big hit. Along with Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple, Uriah Heep had become one of the top bands in the early 1970s - one of &quot;The Big 4&quot; of hard rock.\n\nUriah Heep's audience declined by the 1980s, to the point where they became essentially a cult band in the United Kingdom and United States. The band maintains a significant following and performs at arena-sized venues in the Balkans, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Russia and Scandinavia. They have sold over 40 million albums worldwide with over 4 million sales in the U.S","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:298a01a0b0936a6c3e140f58da3d85f2aa7cacb3","amp;dn":"Uriah+Heep%2FRainbow+Demon%3ALive+%26amp%3B+In+The+Studio%5B2004%5D%5B320KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"298a01a0b0936a6c3e140f58da3d85f2aa7cacb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,138,1,160,176,147,106,108,62,20,15,88,218,61,133,242,170,124,172,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
