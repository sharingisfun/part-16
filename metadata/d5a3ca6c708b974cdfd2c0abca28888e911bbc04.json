The two ex-presidents realize they have an enemy within the government and set out to find evidence that will clear their names. The search takes them across the Southern Appalachians; along the way they meet a homeless couple, thwart kidnapers in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant, and find themselves marching in a gay pride parade.\n\nQuincyMKT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5a3ca6c708b974cdfd2c0abca28888e911bbc04","amp;dn":"My+Fellow+Americans+%281996%29+%5BDVDRip%2C+1.33+FS%2C+Eng%5D+-+QuincyMKT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5a3ca6c708b974cdfd2c0abca28888e911bbc04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,163,202,108,112,139,151,76,223,210,192,171,202,40,136,142,145,27,188,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
