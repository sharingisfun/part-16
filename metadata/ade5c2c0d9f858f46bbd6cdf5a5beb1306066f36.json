Now, in a reversal of fortune, principal songwriter Tony Mortimer - once ousted in favour of former backing vocalist Brian Harvey - returns to the front of the group. At the same time, their music has changed almost beyond recognition, turning from pop-RnB into pop-rock complete with full live rock band instrumentation.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01.
