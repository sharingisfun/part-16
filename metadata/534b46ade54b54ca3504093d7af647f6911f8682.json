Features of the model include independently operated screen wipers, four position reverser, two-tone horn, opening cab windows, operating sun visors and configurable locomotive running numbers and names.\n\nThe locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the Class 50 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator. Also included are scenarios specifically for the Settle to Carlisle route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).\n\n\n\nPlease support the developers and buy some of their content if you can afford it.\n\n\nIf you want to say thanks, contribute and share an addon with the community then email them to us...
