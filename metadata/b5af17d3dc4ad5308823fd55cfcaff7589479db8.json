The promo video for the single was made up of clips of footage from Lennon's other videos, as are most posthumous Lennon videos.\n\nThe lyrics make reference to &quot;a little yellow idol to the north of Kathmandu&quot; which is similar to a line from J. Milton Hayes' poem entitled The Green Eye of the Yellow God. Hayes' line was &quot;ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a one-eyed yellow idol to the north of Kathmandu&quot;. Another line in the song is &quot;There's UFO's over New York and I ain't too surprised&quot;, apparently a reference to a UFO sighting Lennon had back in 1974. He made reference to this in the liner notes to his 1974 album Walls and Bridges with the message: &quot;On the 23rd August 1974 at 9 o'clock I saw a U.F.O. - J.L.&quot;. The line &quot;Nobody told me there'd be days like these...&quot; is in contrast to the old adage &quot;My mother told me there'd be days like this.&quot;\n\nRecorded (but uncompleted) shortly before his death in 1980, the song was later completed by Lennon's widow Yoko Ono in 1983 and released as the first single from Lennon and Ono's album Milk and Honey in 1984. The song was later released in the UK in 1990, b/w &quot;I'm Stepping Out&quot;. The song was originally written for Ringo Starr to include on his 1981 album Stop and Smell the Roses, but Lennon died before the song could be used.\n\n&quot;Nobody Told Me&quot; was Lennon's last new single to reach the UK Top 10, peaking at number 6 (although a reissue of &quot;Imagine&quot; reached number 3 in December 1999). The single was also Lennon's last US Top 10 hit, peaking at number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100, number 6 on the Cashbox Top 100 and was his third single to enter the US Top 10 posthumously.\n\n\nJohn Winston Ono Lennon, MBE, born John Winston Lennon; (9 October 1940 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8 December 1980), was an English musician, singer and songwriter who rose to worldwide fame as a founder member of the pop band the Beatles, the most commercially successful band in the history of popular music. With Paul McCartney, he formed a celebrated songwriting partnership.\n\nBorn and raised in Liverpool, as a teenager Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze; his first band, the Quarrymen, evolved into the Beatles in 1960. When the group disbanded in 1970, Lennon embarked on a solo career that produced the critically acclaimed albums John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine, and iconic songs such as &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; and &quot;Working Class Hero&quot;. After his marriage to Yoko Ono in 1969, he changed his name to John Ono Lennon. Lennon disengaged himself from the music business in 1975 to raise his infant son Sean, but re-emerged with Ono in 1980 with the new album Double Fantasy. He was murdered three weeks after its release.\n\nAs of 2012, Lennon's solo album sales in the United States exceeded 14 million and, as writer, co-writer or performer, he is responsible for 25 number-one singles on the US Hot 100 chart. In 2002, a BBC poll on the 100 Greatest Britons voted him eighth and, in 2008, Rolling Stone ranked him the fifth-greatest singer of all time. He was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987 and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice; as a member of the Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1994.\n(video does not have any logos and was extracted untouched from the DVD)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobody_Told_Me&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobody_Told_Me&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/vgboil537/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/vgboil537/&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 6900kbps\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD, 16 bits]\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz 6ch 448kbps\n   Audio: DTS Digital 48000Hz 6ch 768kbps [DVD, 24 bits]\n   Duration: 00:03:59\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
