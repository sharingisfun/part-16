Ever since then I was looking for this album. Now that I got my hands on it I find the songs on this album as amazing as I had found 10 years earlier. Not only is the music beautiful but the voice of Dalaras is just amazing. In a world where new &quot;artists&quot; are a weekly phenomenon, Dalaras's talent as can be witnessed through this album is a reminder that there remains some authentic artists who's presence can still be felt through their music and who's music transcends the recording and provides the listener with true feelings. If you've ever enjoyed latin or mediteranean music and dislike fast-food music then this is for you. I listen to a lot of music and Dalaras and this album in particular rate as #1 on my chart. If it was possible, I would've given it 10 stars.[/quote]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3abdd1de0b21232afcc18f2032dc99341a6fea19","amp;dn":"George+Dalaras+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+2003+Digital+Remasters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3abdd1de0b21232afcc18f2032dc99341a6fea19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,189,209,222,11,33,35,42,252,193,143,32,50,220,153,52,26,111,234,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
