Toward the close of the medieval period in the late fourteenth century, western Europe looks backward in two directions simultaneously: toward the firmly rooted but increasingly troubled beliefs that had come to dominate Europe, and toward the cultural legacy of antiquity. Late medieval thinkers focus increasingly on humans in the worldÃ¢â‚¬â€on human achievements and foolishness... . The result is Renaissance humanism, an explosion of cultural accomplishment in visual art, literature, and music that ranges from Giotto to Michelangelo, from Dante to Shakespeare.\n\nThis course will examine this extraordinary sweep of cultural history from the aftermath of Emperor Constantine's ... in the fourth century to the burgeoning of Descartes's doubt in the seventeenth century. We will tantalize the student with tidbits from a wide array of literary and visual works, rather than examine a few such works in great detail. We hope to inspire the student to read more deeply and widely and look further than the brief span of twenty lectures allows us.\n\nLectures: \n\n1. Barbarians and the medieval world\n2.
