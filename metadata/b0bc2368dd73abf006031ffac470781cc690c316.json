The 2007 Chromatics album Night Drive wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t an active-listening sort of thing; it was probably best heard as an evocative background pulse, one that would pull you in with a powerful piece of melody every so often but then release you and send you back about your business. Kill For Love works in a pretty similar way. Long stretches are instrumental, and the tick-tock beats and zoned-out vocals might get a bit boring if you were exclusively focusing on them. But thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not how most of us listen to music, and the music on Kill For Love works in the same sort of way that Explosions In The Sky does. It fades into the background while at the same time making the colors all around us look a bit more vivid, making us feel as if weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re existing in some imaginary cinematic landscape.\n\nOf course, that involves making extramusical brain-synapse connections. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no secret that Explosions In The Sky start to sound a whole lot better once youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been watching Friday Night Lights for a while; their winding guitar filigrees evoke the dusty Texan triumphs of the TV show that famously uses them. In just the same way, Kill For Love now calls up the glimmering, skeezy, beautifully brutal imagined Los Angeles of Drive, and I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite imagine how the album would sound if I hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seen the movie. But thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really a moot point. If you havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seen Drive, what the f*** are you waiting for? See Drive! ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great! Then listen to Kill For Love.\n\nDark dance-pop aesthetes Chromatics return to release their first album since 2007's Night Drive\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0bc2368dd73abf006031ffac470781cc690c316","amp;dn":"Chromatics...Kill+for+Love%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0bc2368dd73abf006031ffac470781cc690c316","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,188,35,104,221,115,171,240,6,3,31,250,196,112,120,28,198,144,195,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
