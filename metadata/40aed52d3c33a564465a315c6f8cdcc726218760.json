It was enough to make their second major-label album, Pork Soda, one of the strangest records ever to debut in the Top Ten. Stylistically, it isn&amp;#039;t much different from Sailing the Seas of Cheese, though the band does stretch out and jam more often. This can result in some overly repetitive sections, since Claypool&amp;#039;s riffs are the basis for most of the compositions, but it also showcases the band&amp;#039;s ever-increasing level of musicianship. Their ensemble interplay continues to grow in complexity and musicality, and that&amp;#039;s really what fans want from a Primus record anyway. The material isn&amp;#039;t quite as consistent as Seas of Cheese, though there are numerous high points; among them are &quot;My Name Is Mud,&quot; on which Claypool plays his instrument like percussion, and &quot;Mr. Krinkle,&quot; where he switches to a bowed upright bass. There are hints of lyrical darkness stripped of the band&amp;#039;s usual goofiness (especially in the suicide lament &quot;Bob&quot;), but for the most part, the humor is again split between eccentric character sketches, cheery paranoia, and annoying novelties (with a slightly higher percentage of the latter than before). Still, despite occasional flaws, what makes Pork Soda a success is that the band keeps finding novel variations on their signature sound, even if they never step out of it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40aed52d3c33a564465a315c6f8cdcc726218760","amp;dn":"Primus+-+Pork+Soda","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40aed52d3c33a564465a315c6f8cdcc726218760","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,174,213,45,60,51,165,100,70,90,49,92,111,140,220,199,38,33,135,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
