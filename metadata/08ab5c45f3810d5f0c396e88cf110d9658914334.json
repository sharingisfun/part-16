Its still there. See if you can hatch it (and adopt the cute little basilish waiting inside.)\n\nPlease be aware that this is my first scanlation work. Ive had different versions everywhere and I'm hoping that I collated the finished pages correctly, with the latest edit. Please forgive me if I stuffed up anywhere along the conveyor belt (versioning, proof-reading, etc, for both this and the Thiebaut book). Let's hope I didn't upload grandmas sepia-coloured girlhood pics by mistake.\n\nWithout data9724s photoshop mentoring and suggestions/advise generally, I'd have adandoned this project before the first week was up.\nI thank him profusely for his patience, ready answers to endless questions, insights and solutions. You rock, Sir! (One day I'll have to get his advise on creating nice, non-blurry screenshots, because that art is a mystery to me).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08ab5c45f3810d5f0c396e88cf110d9658914334","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Companions+03+-+The+Last+Song+of+the+Malaterres","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08ab5c45f3810d5f0c396e88cf110d9658914334","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,171,92,69,243,129,13,95,12,57,110,136,207,17,13,150,88,145,67,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
