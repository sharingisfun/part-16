That the ancient Greeks made themselves look less ancient by inventing moisturizer? That the mysterious drug obecalp* is as effective as homeopathy and many herbal cures? From the bestselling author of An Apple a Day, Brain Fuel, and Science, Sense and Nonsense comes a fresh batch of inquiries into the science of everyday life. Dr. Joe, as he is affectionately known to millions of readers, listeners, viewers, and students, presents his third book in the Doubleday Canada series he launched with Brain Fuel.\nUsing a Q&amp;A format, it explains the world through science, and science through our common experience. There are sections on diet and nutrition, new drugs, and the dubious claims made for alternative remedies and beauty potions. There is a profusion of inspiring, enlightening, sometime just downright bizarre information drawn from the laboratory, from history, from our medicine cabinets and the bottles under our sinks. Science is everywhere, and Dr. Joe is keeping track - and doing it in a marvelously warm, eminently readable style. Let the brain sparks fly!\n*Try reading this word backwards.\n\nEnjoy and seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb7a6ee91b80382fa2e89d685de960a77ba88ce2","amp;dn":"How+did+they+do+that%2FScience+of+everyday+life+3+epubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb7a6ee91b80382fa2e89d685de960a77ba88ce2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,122,110,233,27,128,56,47,162,232,157,104,93,233,96,167,123,168,140,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
