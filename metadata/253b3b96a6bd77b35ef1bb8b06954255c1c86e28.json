It was released in Europe on October 25, 1996, and in the U.S. on January 1997. A single featuring track &quot;Song of the Seas&quot; was released simultaneously.\n\nVangelis was personally involved in the sleevedesign, as he used to be in the late seventies and early eighties. The album proved 'too light' for many old fans who prefer Vangelis' roots with progressive music, but was welcomed by many of the New Age generation of his fans.\n\nOceanic's music was used in the soundtrack for the 1998 documentary &quot;Deep Seas, Deep Secrets&quot; co-produced by The Learning Channel and Discovery Channel, together with music from Vangelis previous album, Voices.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
