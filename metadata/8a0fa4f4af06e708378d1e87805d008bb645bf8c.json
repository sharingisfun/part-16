GooralÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s output is strongly influenced by his native town of Bielsko-BiaÃ…â€ša, a place surrounded by mountains Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for some an entrance onto high ridges, for others a gateway to civilization. A distinctive feature of GooralÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music is itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unequaled energy. An energy that you can fully notice and sense especially during his live performances. The formula of this energy is based on fresh-sounding mix of various musical traditions. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s truly something to be experienced!\n\nGooral has a record of almost 150 successful shows. The setup was featured in many music festivals, e.g. Heineken Opener Festival (Gdynia), Red Bull X Fighers (PoznaÃ…â€ž), Coke Live Festival (Cracow) not to mention club concerts, outdoor performances and charity events. All of them attest to the versatility of Gooral project. April of 2011 saw GooralÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ethno ElectroÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ issued by SP Records. What is Gooral to in 2012?
