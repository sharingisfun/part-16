Touch is critical to our physical and mental health. And for centuries, cultures around the globe have employed touch as a powerful force for healing. And yet America is an increasingly touch-deprived, high-stress culture, and we are paying for it with our wellbeing. Now, in The Touch Remedy, leading touch therapy expert Michelle Ebbin, who appears regularly on The Dr. Oz Show and has been featured on The Doctors, The View, and Live with Kelly &amp; Michael, demonstrates how the ancient wisdom of touch can truly change your life.\r\n\r\nA fresh, contemporary approach to natural health, which draws on a unique combination of ancient wisdom and cutting edge research, The Touch Remedy is a collection of proven touch therapy solutions to calm and heal every member of the family, from babies to grandparents to pets. Demystifying time-tested touch therapy techniques such as Acupressure, Reflexology, Cranial Sacral Therapy, among others, Ebbin shares her invaluable insight and provides clear, step-by-step remedies, accompanied by beautiful full-color photos, to relieve a range of physical and emotional stressors, from back pain and headache to anxiety. Her solutions are quick, taking only two-to-three minutes each, and easy, requiring only three steps, and most of the remedies can be done anytime, anywhere, even on the go.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Ebbin shows how touch therapy offers powerful strategies to improve intimacy in relationships, bond with your children, and improve communication through touch. With The Touch Remedy, we can quite literally take our health into our own handsâ€”and nurture the bodies, minds, and spirit of our loved ones and ourselves","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:013c2512a876d18321248bb8db9d02323603ab74","amp;dn":"The+Touch+Remedy+%282016%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"013c2512a876d18321248bb8db9d02323603ab74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,60,37,18,168,118,209,131,33,36,139,184,219,157,2,50,54,3,171,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
