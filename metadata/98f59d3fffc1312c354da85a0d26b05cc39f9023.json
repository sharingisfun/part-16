While spying on her son and his date on a trip to the zoo, Lionel&amp;#039;s domineering mother (Elizabeth Moody) is bitten by a vicious Sumatran rat monkey and consequently starts manifesting some rather peculiar behavior, attacking all those unfortunate enough to get in her way and turning them into zombies. Poor Lionel (Timothy Balme) is forced to hide her victims in his basement in order to conceal his mother&amp;#039;s grotesque affliction from his love interest, Paquita (Diana PeÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â±alver). But soon his mom&amp;#039;s zombified entourage starts to rebel and becomes too much for Lionel to handle. In the raucous finale, Lionel takes on a whole army of the undead (plus the occasional unruly bodily organ) with his trusty lawnmower and finally confronts his mother in an all-out Oedipal extravaganza. Though so over the top that it&amp;#039;s often classified as a comedy rather than a fright film, DEAD ALIVE has also been touted as one of the goriest horror movies ever made--so be warned: It&amp;#039;s not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach.\n\n----\n\nThis is the most violent movie ever made.  It is so bad, that you will laugh the whole way through.  It&amp;#039;s mind blowing violence.\n\nThis is the the movie &quot;Braindead&quot;.  For those that do not know &amp;#039;&amp;#039;Dead Alive&quot; is the USA title, and &quot;Braindead&quot; is the international title.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98f59d3fffc1312c354da85a0d26b05cc39f9023","amp;dn":"Braindead.1992.DVDRip.XviD-Cape","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98f59d3fffc1312c354da85a0d26b05cc39f9023","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,245,157,63,255,193,49,44,53,77,168,90,13,38,176,92,195,159,144,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
