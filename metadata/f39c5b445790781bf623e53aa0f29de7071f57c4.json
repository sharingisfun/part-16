Peter Asher was the older brother of Jane Asher, Paul McCartney's girlfriend for much of the 1960s. This no doubt gave Asher and Gordon Waller access to Lennon-McCartney compositions that were unrecorded by the Beatles, such as &quot;A World Without Love&quot; and three of their other biggest hits, &quot;Nobody I Know,&quot; &quot;I Don't Want to See You Again,&quot; and &quot;Woman&quot; (the last of which was written by McCartney under a pseudonym). But Peter &amp; Gordon were significant talents in their own right, a sort of Everly Brothers-styled duo for the British Invasion that faintly prefigured the folk-rock of the mid-'60s. In fact, when Gene Clark first approached Jim McGuinn in 1964 about working together in a group that would eventually evolve into the Byrds, he suggested that they could form a Peter &amp; Gordon-styled act.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/peter-gordon-p5136/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/peter-gordon-p5136/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Heather Phares):\n\nThough it's been outclassed by 2001's The Ultimate Peter &amp; Gordon, Rhino's The Best of Peter &amp; Gordon from a decade earlier is still one of the best collections of the British Invasion group's work. Along with their Lennon/McCartney-penned hits &quot;A World Without Love,&quot; &quot;Nobody I Know,&quot; and &quot;I Don't Want to See You Again,&quot; it also features their other big singles &quot;Go to Pieces,&quot; &quot;Woman,&quot; and &quot;Lady Godiva,&quot; as well as smaller hits like &quot;The Jokers&quot; and some album tracks and B-sides. While some of their more orchestrated songs, like their versions of &quot;True Love Ways,&quot; &quot;To Know You Is to Love You,&quot; and &quot;Baby I'm Yours,&quot; sound a little stiff and dated, all of their early hits and many of their later songs still sound pretty fresh. In particular, &quot;Knight in Rusty Armour&quot; and the pretty folk of &quot;The Flower Lady&quot; have held up well, as has the mod psychedelia of &quot;I Feel Like Going&quot; and the brash &quot;You've Had Better Times.&quot; While it's no longer the definitive single-disc Peter &amp; Gordon collection, The Best of Peter &amp; Gordon is still quite good, and its best songs are a welcome reminder of how the duo helped define the poppier side of the British Invasion.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-peter--gordon-rhino-r15137&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-peter--gordon-rhino-r15137&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000008JF7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000008JF7&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
