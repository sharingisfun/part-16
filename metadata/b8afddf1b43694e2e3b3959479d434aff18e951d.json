We discover the            \n    intention behind laser propulsion in the creation of       \n    flying saucer technology, and meet Cedric Lynch, an       \n    illustrious engineer who invented electric tricycles,    \n    as he competes in the world famous TT race on the Isle    \n    of Man with his electric motorbike.                        \n                                                              \n    We take a trip to St. Petersburg in Russia and meet      \n    Mikhail Puchkov, who has spent the last 30 years          \n    building his own submarine. We meet Sir Clive Sinclair,    \n    who devised the first digital watches, home computers     \n    and pocket calculators, but who still has plans to       \n    revolutionise personal transport.                         \n                                                               \n    Jem Stansfield looks at Brunel's Atmospheric Railway      \n    system, and discovers that perhaps it wasn't the         \n    failure history remembers it being.                       \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                                   \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8afddf1b43694e2e3b3959479d434aff18e951d","amp;dn":"Wallace.and.Gromits.World.of.Invention.S01E06.720p.HDTV.x264-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8afddf1b43694e2e3b3959479d434aff18e951d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,175,221,241,180,54,148,226,227,179,149,148,121,212,52,175,241,142,149,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
