In MunroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hands, the people she writes aboutÃ¢â‚¬â€œwomen of all ages and circumstances, and their friends, lovers, parents, and childrenÃ¢â‚¬â€œbecome as vivid as our own neighbors. It is her miraculous gift to make these stories as real and unforgettable as our own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92b31e967f8ca7b67debec5ddd16719de7d4f160","amp;dn":"Runaway+-+Alice+Munro.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92b31e967f8ca7b67debec5ddd16719de7d4f160","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,179,30,150,127,140,167,182,125,235,236,93,221,22,113,157,231,212,241,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
