He has effectively taken a great DVD and made it even stronger, and thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s seemingly nothing that Ferguson canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t do with a single poker chip or stack of chips. Whether you want to twirl, stack, toss, shuffle or roll poker chips, FergusonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first rate DVD shows you how. \n\nVariations \nThe original Chip Tricks Volume 1 released with some 20 stunts while this re-release offers some 70 stunts that include the 20 from the first DVD. While there are some new flourishes, many are variations on a single flourish. \n\nFor example, FergusonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œButterfly,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a poker chip variation on a coin rollout, now comes in multiple variations that include: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFat Butterfly,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œButterfly Balance,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œButterfly CollapseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and more. On the first DVD, Ferguson offered a few variations with some flourishes, but didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t count them as single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtricks.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ They were simply discussed with the main flourish. Despite this, the new DVD is indeed far more comprehensive than the first title. \n\nCoin and Card-Like \nNew to the collection are FergusonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcatches,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œspinningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and various ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtosses.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Catches are variations on those old coin tricks where you, for example, rest a stack of quarters on your elbow or back of your hand and attempt to quickly reach up and snatch them out of the air. The flashy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œspinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtosses,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ where Ferguson causes chips to fly through the air and then catches them or causes them to return in different ways, are welcome new additions to the flourish collection. \n\nInterestingly, Ferguson adapts some card moves to poker chips. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDribblingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of chips is just as you would with cards. And some chip tosses are variations on card spinning. Ferguson also offers a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSybilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ style four-way cut (Chris KennerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s original with cards is a five-way cut) using chips. Since he teaches his four-way cut on another DVD, he doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t explain it here but encourages viewers to refer to that DVD. \n\nGreat Learning Tool \nThe DVD features professional production values and throughout, Ferguson does a great job of explaining and teaching each flourish. Some of the flourishes can be adapted to coin work. \n\n\n\nPLEASE SEED YOUR 1:1\n\nIF YOU LIKED IT BUY IT !!!\n\nthank you very much\n\nenjoy !!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:684d20649cfdc3b4996e71dde455d36f9c5155ed","amp;dn":"Rich+Ferguson+-+Chip+Tricks+Volume+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"684d20649cfdc3b4996e71dde455d36f9c5155ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,77,32,100,156,253,195,180,153,110,113,221,228,85,211,111,156,81,85,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
