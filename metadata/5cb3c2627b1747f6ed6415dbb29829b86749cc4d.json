Decorate with doilies in three shapes, plus freestanding roses --from buds to full-blown beauties. Petals are stitched with organza, while leaves are thread-only K-LaceÃ‚Â®. All designs in this package are stitched with 50/60 wt. cotton thread. The oval doily (13&quot; x 16&quot;) may be made longer by adding to the center. Two edging styles are available for all doilies. The 11&quot; square doily may also be stitched larger or rectangular by adding squares. This collection also contains coordinating versatile flexible edgings. Composite files included for machines with larger hoops.\n\nThere are 28 individual files that fit in 100mm-square hoops.  Dst, pes and jef formats have extra combined files for larger hoops. The oval and round doilies have parts too large for the Janome 9000 hoop. 50/60-weight cotton thread is needed for stitching these on water-soluble stabilizer. Instructions, including illustrations, are contained in an included pdf file.\n\nSee: http://www.criswell-emb.com/frontpage/pg00038.html\n\n0dd8a11","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cb3c2627b1747f6ed6415dbb29829b86749cc4d","amp;dn":"Criswell+Embroidery+%26+Design+-+835+The+Rosalie+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cb3c2627b1747f6ed6415dbb29829b86749cc4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,179,194,98,123,23,71,246,237,100,21,219,178,152,41,184,103,73,204,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
