Deaver has stylishly fulfilled his brief. Independent The most impressive feature of CARTE BLANCHE is the ingenuity of the breathless, blood-thirsty plot ... Kingsley Amis, John Gardner and Sebastian Faulks are among those who have tried to bring Bond back to life. Deaver, though, is in a class of his own: nobody's done it better. Evening Standard 'Top US thriller writer Jeffery Deaver has brought Bond bang up to date ... CARTE BLANCHE has it all.' **** Sun '[A] gripping modern thriller ... Bond fans will enjoy Deaver's slightly mischievous take on Ian Fleming. Deaver fans will enjoy the taut plotting and the action scenes and, by the way, it is going to make a great movie.' ***** Daily Express 'CARTE BLANCHE promises to be fast-paced, packed with twists and turns as torturous as any Bond car chase.'","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3a2f7e8fbfbb5af248e98a7eabaf9ba80379798","amp;dn":"Jeffrey+Deaver+-+Carte+Blanche","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3a2f7e8fbfbb5af248e98a7eabaf9ba80379798","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,162,247,232,251,251,181,175,36,142,152,167,234,186,249,186,128,55,151,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
