It is often cited as one of the seminal works of fiction of the 20th century and is widely studied in colleges and universities across the western world.\nThe Metamorphosis is one of the most frequently analyzed works in literature. This elusive story, which chronicles the transformation of Gregor Samsa from a human being into an enormous insect, is renowned for its ability to inspire diverse, sometimes mutually exclusive interpretations. For this reason The Metamorphosis has come to be considered one of the central enigmas of the modern literary imagination. Nevertheless, critics generally praise Kafka's powerful and symbolic portrayal of alienation achieved through the literalized metaphor of man as insect.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:216bc83afd291ee4c074a1fe186ed7a263e2121f","amp;dn":"Metamorphosis+by+Franz+Kafka+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"216bc83afd291ee4c074a1fe186ed7a263e2121f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,107,200,58,253,41,30,228,192,116,161,254,24,110,215,162,99,226,18,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
