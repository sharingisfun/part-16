When he died, age 36, in 1791 he had created a body of work unrivalled before or since. The autographs of many of his greatest compositions have survived and show page after page of perfect manuscript with no corrections and no additions. Mozart didn't write sketches or short scores. He committed the completed work to paper and that was it. Job done.\n\nAldous Huxley in his famous essay on creativity ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Doors of PerceptionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ written under the influence of mescaline, suggests that the greatest creative talents are not really creative at all but the result of a direct conduit to the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“EtherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, a filter for the collective creative conscience.\n\nThe Requiem was MozartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s last composition. He did not live to complete it and the enduring question is how much of it is by Mozart and how much by his pupil SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ssmayr who completed the work after MozartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death.\n\nThe central enigma lies in the fact that on the one hand SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ssmayr was a very ordinary talent as a composer and on the other hand the pupilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ if indeed it is his - matches that of the master. Perhaps, in the emotional turmoil surrounding MozartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death, SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ssmayr made his own brief but extraordinary connection with the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“EtherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢? Much scholarly verbiage has been expended on this enigma and there have been several unsuccessful attempts to improve on SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ssmayr.\n\nSir Colin Davis has spent a lifetime with the works of Mozart and believes that, whatever the arguments of scholars, there is no point in messing with a masterpiece. This performance with a fine group of young soloists and the LSO and LSO chorus on top form provides the perfect justification for his view.\n\n\nTracklisting:\n1. Requiem\n2. Dies Irae\n3.
