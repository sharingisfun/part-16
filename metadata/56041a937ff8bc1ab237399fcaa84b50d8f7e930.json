With the kite-flying festival only days away, Oliver tracks down his reclusive great-uncle Gilbert, a former champion. With Gilbert's help, Oliver can picture himself on the crest, launching into the winds to become one of the legendary fliers of Windblowne.\n\nThen his great-uncle vanishes during a battle with mysterious attack kitesÃ¢â‚¬â€kites that seem to fly themselves! All that remains is his prize possession, a simple crimson kite. At least, the kite seems simple. When Oliver tries to fly it, the kite lifts him high above the trees. When he comes down, the town and all its people have disappeared. Suddenly the festival is the last thing on Oliver's mind as he is catapulted into a mystery that will change everything he understands about himself and his world.\n\nInspired by the work of Diana Wynne Jones, debut author Stephen Messer delivers a fantasy book for boys and girls in which the distance between realities is equal to the breadth of a kite string.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56041a937ff8bc1ab237399fcaa84b50d8f7e930","amp;dn":"Windblowne+-+Stephen+Messer.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56041a937ff8bc1ab237399fcaa84b50d8f7e930","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,4,26,147,127,248,188,26,178,55,57,159,202,168,75,80,216,247,233,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
