Once\n\nCredits: Show\n\nWith his deep, gently blurred voice and wandering minor-chord songs, Buckner has created his most intensely beautiful and evocative album with Since. He's taken the spare sounds and textures of Devotion + Doubt, a record lauded by many but heard by few, and draped them behind a dense sonic scrim. In the past Buckner has relied on his voice to carry the hefty emotional freight of his lyrics of loss and desperation, but here, with a band that includes, in Buckner's words, &quot;all the musicians I dreamed of recording with,&quot; he is free to liberate his baritone, and it slips and slides wonderfully throughout. There's an exuberance here; his subject matter hasn't changed, but he attacks it with an enthusiastic bombast. The songs are crammed right up against each other, and the lyrics are a cavalcade of paired alliteration (&quot;horsey and the hopper&quot;, &quot;brief and boundless&quot;, &quot;twiced and townless&quot;), oft-repeated favorite words (razed, faith, floor, rain, moon, li'l), and huge emotions hidden in small acts. It's a murky dream Buckner wanders; his opaque poetry suggests more than explains. It's hard to get a handle on exactly what is going on with such lines as &quot;If I ever leave this 10-day room / I'll send my shallow ground to you.&quot; But the songs hit you--hard--just the same","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a022ab0a8cf86d3a7d92b0b91b4dcd5c2c32856","amp;dn":"Richard+Buckner+-+Since+%5B1998%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a022ab0a8cf86d3a7d92b0b91b4dcd5c2c32856","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,2,42,176,168,207,134,211,167,217,43,11,145,180,220,213,194,195,40,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
