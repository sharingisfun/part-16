Nutrition expert David Zinczenkoâ€”the New York Times bestselling author of the Abs Diet series, Eat This, Not That! series, and Eat It to Beat It!â€”has spent his entire career learning about belly fatâ€”where it comes from and what it does to us. And what he knows is this: There is no greater threat to you and your familyâ€”to your health, your happiness, even your financial future.\r\n\r\nYes, you can: Change your destiny. Overcome your fat genes. Strip away belly fat and finally attain the lean, strong, healthy body youâ€™ve always wanted.\r\n \r\nWith Zero Belly Diet, David Zinczenko reveals explosive new research that explains the mystery of why some of us stay thin, and why some canâ€™t lose weight no matter how hard we try. He explains how some foods turn our fat genes onâ€”causing seemingly irreversible weight gainâ€”and uncovers the nine essential power foods that act directly on those switches, turning them to â€œoffâ€ and allowing for easy, rapid, and sustainable weight loss. And he shows how these foods help heal your digestive system, keeping those gene switches turned off and setting you up for a lifetime of leanness.\r\n \r\nOther diets can help you lose weight, but only the Zero Belly diet attacks fat on a genetic level, placing a bullâ€™s-eye on the fat cells that matter most: visceral fat, the type of fat ensconced in your belly. These fat cells act like an invading army, increasing inflammation and putting you at risk for diabetes, Alzheimerâ€™s, arthritis, heart disease, and cancer. Visceral fat can also can alter your hormone levels, erode muscle tissue, increase your chances of depression, and destroy your sex drive. But you can turn the odds in your favor.\r\n \r\nZero Belly Diet shows you how to deactivate your fat genes, rev up your metabolism, banish bloat, and balance your digestive health, allowing you to easily build lean, strong stomach muscle and strip away unwanted belly fat without sacrificing calories or spending hours at the gym.
