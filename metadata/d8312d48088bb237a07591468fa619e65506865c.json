Film-makers relished his vivid characters and dramatic plots as well as the magic and poetry of his work.\r\n\r\nAt first the results were patchy, then came Laurence Olivier. With Henry V, made to stir patriotic spirit during the Second World War, he perfectly translated Shakespeare from the stage to the screen. He followed Henry V with Hamlet, and both were smash hits. Olivier led the way for directors as diverse as Orson Welles, Kurosawa, Franco Zeffirelli, Roman Polanski, Baz Luhrmann and Kenneth Branagh.\r\n\r\nThe Bard's language has been no barrier, with bold versions of his dramas coming out of Russia, Japan, India and many other countries, not to mention Hollywood's free adaptations in genres as diverse as musicals and science fiction. Already over 30 films worldwide have been produced based on Romeo and Juliet alone.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in a single documentary, Arena explores the rich, global history of Shakespeare in the cinema, with a treasure trove of film extracts and archival interviews with their creators.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/94/All-the-World-s-a-Screen-Shakespeare-on-Film-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/06/All-the-World-s-a-Screen-Shakespeare-on-Film-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/90/All-the-World-s-a-Screen-Shakespeare-on-Film-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5a/All-the-World-s-a-Screen-Shakespeare-on-Film-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e6/All-the-World-s-a-Screen-Shakespeare-on-Film-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5c/All-the-World-s-a-Screen-Shakespeare-on-Film-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/01/All-the-World-s-a-Screen-Shakespeare-on-Film-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/78/All-the-World-s-a-Screen-Shakespeare-on-Film-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ee/All-the-World-s-a-Screen-Shakespeare-on-Film-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 21.5 (~3809Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1920x1080\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.48 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 1.63 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0791p2k","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8312d48088bb237a07591468fa619e65506865c","amp;dn":"BBC+Arena+2016+All+the+Worlds+a+Screen+Shakespeare+on+Film+1080p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8312d48088bb237a07591468fa619e65506865c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,49,45,72,8,139,178,55,160,117,145,70,143,166,25,230,85,6,134,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
