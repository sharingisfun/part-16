But they're the same generals we know in name only: their appearance, personality, and gender are all different. One day, first Oda Nobunaga and then all the others are transported to our world. Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2ab0f596a02d8cd7dc2c8303f67c0a4dc03ba8d","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+18+%5B720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2ab0f596a02d8cd7dc2c8303f67c0a4dc03ba8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,171,15,89,106,2,216,205,125,194,200,48,63,103,192,164,220,3,186,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
