Aptly named Journeys, it takes the listener on a series of synaesthesic voyages through soundscapes bound to cause self-induced auditory hallucinations and third-eye dilation. A unique fusion of powerful grooves with twisted sounds, this is a debut album not to be missed.\n\n\n\n 1. Mana\nKABAYUN\n \n 2. Good News\nKABAYUN\n \n 3. Journeys\nKABAYUN\n \n 4.
