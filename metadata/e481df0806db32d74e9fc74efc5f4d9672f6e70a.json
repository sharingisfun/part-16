Shirley Glubok now turns to the art of the lands mentioned in the Bible to present further insight into the spirit and nature of ancient peoples. A collection of fine photographs set artfully against color-blocked backgrounds accompanied by brief descriptions make this a sound introduction to ancient art and life. The author relates the art objects to the culture and historical background of the Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians and others. Often, a discussion of the artist's methods and use of materials is introduced","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e481df0806db32d74e9fc74efc5f4d9672f6e70a","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Lands+in+the+Bible+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e481df0806db32d74e9fc74efc5f4d9672f6e70a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,129,223,8,6,219,50,215,78,159,199,78,252,95,77,150,114,246,231,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
