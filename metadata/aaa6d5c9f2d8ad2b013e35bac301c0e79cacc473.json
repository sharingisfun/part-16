The band released just one album, the self-titled &quot;Butter 08&quot; in 1996 on the Beastie Boys&amp;#039; now defunct Grand Royal record label. The album features guest performances by future Cibo Matto members Timo Ellis and Sean Lennon as well as a performance by filmmaker Evan Bernard who directed music videos for several Grand Royal artists as well as for Cibo Matto and the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion.\n\nIn addition to their one album, a remix of their song &quot;Degobrah&quot; appears on the soundtrack for &quot;City of Industry&quot;, a 1996 film featuring Harvey Keitel.\n\nThe band was allegedly formed when the members spent an evening recording the 1995 Cibo Matto single &quot;Know Your Chicken&quot; together. A demo was then sent to Mike D, who immediately signed Butter 08 to Grand Royal Records.\n\n\n\n&quot;Butter 08&quot; Track Listing\n\n   1. 9MM\n   2. Shut Up\n   3. Butter Of &amp;#039;69\n   4.
