Included images of the album jacket and the vinyl center labels. \n\nI listened to a 1988 CD reissue on BMG [Catalog # 1150-2-RC], and it sounded too different to me. There were added songs, and one song out of sequence. \n\nI want as close to the same experience, on a computer or CD, that I had when I listened to this album on vinyl, over and over, in 1970 when I was 15 years old. To me, these ripped tracks sound superior to the re-mastered CD I heard, and the pops and the warmth of the sound of vinyl are priceless.\n\nTo listen like a vinyl album, load all the Side 1 tracks and play, then get out of your seat, and like turning over the album back in the day, load the Side 2 tracks and cool out. (Alternately, play in Winamp, load up Milkdrop, and trip out)\n\nWhen you burn to CD, select ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½no pause between tracksÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ for the total vinyl experience.\n\nRipped from the original 1968 vinyl to FLAC. \n(Stanton STR8-30 Direct Drive Turntable, Onkyo TX-8011 Stereo Receiver, M-Audio MobilePre USB, Nero WaveEditor, no filters used)\n\nS1-T01 Aquarius.flac\nS1-T02-03 Donna/Hashish.flac\nS1-T04 Sodomy.flac\nS1-T05 Colored Spade.flac\nS1-T06 Manchester England.flac\nS1-T07-08 I'm Black/Ain't Got No.flac\nS1-T09 Air.flac\nS1-T10 Initials.flac\nS1-T11 I Got Life.flac\nS1-T12 Hair.flac\nS1-T13 My Conviction.flac\nS1-T14 Don't Put It Down.flac\nS1-T15 Frank Mills.flac\nS1-T16 Be-In.flac\nS2-T01 Where Do I Go.flac\nS2-T02 Black Boys.flac\nS2-T03 White Boys.flac\nS2-T04 Easy To Be Hard.flac\nS2-T05 Walking in Space.flac\nS2-T06 Abie Baby.flac\nS2-T07 Three-Five-Zero-Zero.flac\nS2-T08 What A Piece of Work is Man.flac\nS2-T09 Good Morning Starshine.flac\nS2-T10 The Fresh Failures (Let the Sunshine In).flac\n\nBack Album jacket.JPG\nFront Album jacket.JPG\nSide 01 label.JPG\nSide 02 label.JPG\n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1522328603d83bcd307f06a7a2ff7d15d0a09e38","amp;dn":"Hair-Original+broadway+cast+1968+RCA+Victor+release","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1522328603d83bcd307f06a7a2ff7d15d0a09e38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,34,50,134,3,216,59,205,48,127,6,167,162,255,125,21,208,160,158,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
