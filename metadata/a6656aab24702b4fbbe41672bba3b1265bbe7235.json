Yet once they are mysteriously drawn together this collection of misfits becomes something very, very different from the rest of humanity.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“More Than HumanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the conjecture on what comes next in the development of the human race. If people had psychic powers, what would be the consequences? What would be the effect on relationships? This story is set at the beginning of such a time, when there are no older generations with the experience to offer advice or teach the young. Mistakes are made, sometimes with tragic results.\n\nThe novel won the 1954 International Fantasy Award.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6656aab24702b4fbbe41672bba3b1265bbe7235","amp;dn":"Theodore+Sturgeon%27s+More+Than+Human","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6656aab24702b4fbbe41672bba3b1265bbe7235","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,101,106,171,36,112,43,79,187,228,22,114,187,163,177,38,91,190,114,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
