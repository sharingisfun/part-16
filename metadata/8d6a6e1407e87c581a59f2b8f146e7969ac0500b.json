As many ozzy fans know speak of the devil wasn't really live. Most of ozzy's vocals were recorded in studio due to voice problems he had during the two shows. Also Sabbath Bloody Sabbath was recorded in soundcheck so that means it was recorded live in the studio with corrected vocals is what I'm assuming. Pretty cool to hear this. Also you can hear the real in between song banter not the PG shit they add to the albums!\n\nOzzy Osbourne live at the Ritz New York NY USA September 26 1982\nAudience version of speak of the devil live album\nQuality ok\n\nSetlist : \n\n\nSymptom of the universe\nSnowblind\nBlack sabbath\nFairies wear boots\nWar pigs \nThe wizzard\nN.I.B.\nSweet leaf\nNever say die\nIron man\nChildren of the grave\nParanoid\n\nEnjoy my friends ;D\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d6a6e1407e87c581a59f2b8f146e7969ac0500b","amp;dn":"Ozzy+Osbourne+-+Ritz82%28Unmixed+Speak+of+the+devil%29+LIVE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d6a6e1407e87c581a59f2b8f146e7969ac0500b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,106,110,20,7,232,124,88,26,89,242,184,241,70,231,150,154,192,80,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
