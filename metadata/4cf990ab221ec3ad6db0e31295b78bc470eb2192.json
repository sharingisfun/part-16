In jazz the ballad represents a slow song, in which the melody and its emotional impact are in the foreground.\n\n...............\n\nThe origin of the term ' ballad' lies in the Latin word 'ballare', which means 'to dance'. Therefore it originally referred to dance-songs. By the 14th century however the word 'ballad' had lost that connotation in English and became a general designation for narrative solo song. The ballad developed from something physically-orientated as a dance-song (with the emphasis on rhythm) into a song in which it is most important what you have to say.\n\n\nAs the American blacks (with the contribution of many white men) developed jazz from folk music into an art form, there was always one consistent element: somthing that was called vaguely, but appropriatly: 'telling a story'. Whether the 'story' should be taken literally (as is the case with a singer interpreting a lyric) or should be understood in the ligfct of the African roots (music is communication of emotions), 'telling a story' lies at the heart of the art of ballad playing, and therefore at the heart of jazz.\n\nThis CD represents a unique choice of jazz ballads, performed by the art's finest instrumentalists and singers. Chet Baker's vocal and trumpet solo on 'Deep In A Dream' may well be the best example of 'telling a story', or better: whispering it directly into your ear.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img692.imageshack.us/img692/6269/folderbv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img692.imageshack.us/img692/6269/folderbv.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n01.
