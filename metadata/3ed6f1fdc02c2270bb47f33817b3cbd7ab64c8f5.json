But when the heist of a local drug dealer (Esai Morales) goes tragically wrong, Mick is sentenced to a brutal juvenile prison where violence is a rite of passage and respect is measured in vengeance. Is Mick headed for a life of crime - or can he find the strength to turn himself around before it's too late? \n\nBad Boys and Fast times at Ridgemont High are two of Sean Penns best movies in my opinion.
