Over to Rodney, the new chairman of the housing committee...\n\nHealthy Competition: RodneyÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s decided to go it alone and leave PeckhamÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s own multinational conglomerate - TrotterÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s Independent Trading. By the end of the week heÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s already cornered the market in used lawn mower engines and with Mickey Pearce as his Financial Director, the skyÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s the limit...\n\nFriday The 14th: Del, Rodney and Grandad are Cornwall-bound to BoycieÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s cottage and a spot of salmon poaching. Should be a doddle of a weekendÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s jolly, if you leave out the bit about the mad-axe-salmon-fisherman-killer whoÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s just escaped from the local institute, that is...\n\nYesterday Never Comes: DelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s into art dealing in a big way, especially when it involves a Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´posh tartÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´ like the glamorous Miranda.

Surely there must be some mistake? Try telling that to Rodders, LondonÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s most wanted criminal...\n\nWhoÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s A Pretty Boy?: Move over Leonardo! The Trotter decorating business is on the roll again. This time theyÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´re just doing a favour for Denzil. Their instructions are simple enough: donÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t eat the fruit or turn on the TV and stay out of the kitchen. So whatÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s happened to Busby, the canary?\n\nThicker Than Water: Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´Tis certainly the season to be jolly and itÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s Grand Marnier and grapefruit all round when Del and RodneyÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s dad comes back to the fold after 18 years. Until he begins to cast doubt on DelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s filial integrity, that is...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:862e0408c5943d2a5c46dbb71bcb5ed0c112035f","amp;dn":"Only-Fools-And-Horses-complete+series+three+aac+mp4+by+winker%40ki","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"862e0408c5943d2a5c46dbb71bcb5ed0c112035f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,46,4,8,197,148,61,42,92,70,219,183,27,203,94,208,193,18,3,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
