The first side serves up horn-inflected party jams, including the rousing title track and &quot;Freedom,&quot; the latter of which sums up the record's overall uplifting theme of independence. The record isn't without its missteps -- the sexist lyrics of &quot;Take Inventory&quot; are highly questionable: &quot;Don't be so loyal and don't be so true/ 'cause if you are boy, they'll run over you.&quot; &quot;Bless&quot; is an obvious re-write of &quot;It's Your Thing&quot;; the Isleys would have been better off leaving that classic alone. A trio of ballads are offered up on the flip, including &quot;I Got to Find Me One.&quot; A song of devotion, it pleads for &quot;one girl who believes in me and wants to marry me.&quot; Call me crazy, but wouldn't marriage render the taking of inventory an impossibility? Though not revolutionary or trailblazing, Get Into Something is every bit an excellent and vibrant funk/soul record.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9af424dc7271fcdb32936ed32e635465f96a4545","amp;dn":"Isley+Brothers+-+Get+Into+Something+%281970%29+%5B1997%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9af424dc7271fcdb32936ed32e635465f96a4545","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,244,36,220,114,113,252,219,50,147,110,211,46,99,84,101,249,106,69,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
