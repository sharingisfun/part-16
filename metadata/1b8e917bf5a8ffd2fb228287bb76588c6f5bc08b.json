So Kaylin Neya is a bit surprised by her safe arrival in the West March. Especially when enemies new and old surround her and those she would call friends are equally dangerous... \n\nAnd then the real trouble starts. Kaylin's assignment is to be a &quot;harmoniste&quot;-one who helps tell the truth behind a Barrani Recitation. But in a land where words are more effective than weapons, Kaylin's duties are deadly. With the wrong phrase she could tear a people further asunder. And with the right ones...well, then she might be able to heal a blight on a race.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b8e917bf5a8ffd2fb228287bb76588c6f5bc08b","amp;dn":"Cast+in+Sorrow+by+Michelle+Sagara.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b8e917bf5a8ffd2fb228287bb76588c6f5bc08b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,142,145,123,245,168,255,210,251,34,130,135,187,118,88,140,111,91,192,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
