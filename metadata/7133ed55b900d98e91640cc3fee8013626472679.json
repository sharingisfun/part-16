It is my turn to give, and I hope you will receive!\n\n\n\nRachmaninov plays Rachmaninov:\n\nWhat a thing to hear Rachmaninov play his own music, especially the great concertos. Personally I think he rushes it :P\n\nThe 10-cd boxset can be found at www.avaxhome.ru along with many other things.\n\nThese .wma files are 160kh/s which is a compression I am satisfied with.\n\nContact me here if this torrent is no longer seeded\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d4bcb1a6b9b5baa7a794b3b9b5bdb8fab7bbb9&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nEnjoy! And share your collections too! Let&amp;#039;s get it all out there!\n\n\n\n\nFILENAMES &amp; FORMATS\n\nI am meticulous in the organisation of my classical music. My filename structure is as follows:\n\neg\n\nRachmaninov - Larrocha - Piano Sonata n. 2, Op. 36 - 1 - Allegro agitato.wma\n     ^           ^               ^            ^      ^          ^         ^\n Composer     Performer        Piece        Opus   Mvmt n.   Movement   format\n\n\nI use this structure so that all the information is contained in the filename, instead of in the tag info or not at all. Filenames are sometimes really long, but this doesn&amp;#039;t bother me.\n\nI use mp3 and wma because these are the formats my portable mp3 player can read.\nMost of my music is kept at a modest 192kb/s (mp3) or 160kb/s (wma). I only sometimes keep symphonic music that I adore at higher bitrates, but for the most part, these bitrates are practical for me.\n\nAs for tag information:\n\nAlbum: Rachmaninov\nArtist: Larrocha\nGenre: Classical Piano\n\nI use this only for my mp3 player so I can navigate my music with ease. I use Audioshell for all my batch tag renaming.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7133ed55b900d98e91640cc3fee8013626472679","amp;dn":"Rachmaninov+Plays+Rachmaninov+%26+Other+Great+Works","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7133ed55b900d98e91640cc3fee8013626472679","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,51,237,85,185,0,217,142,145,100,12,195,254,232,1,54,38,71,38,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
