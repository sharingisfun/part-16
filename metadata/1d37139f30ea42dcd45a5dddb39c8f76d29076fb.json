Romita came to the book as a replacement for Steve Ditko, bringing his clean, romantic style of illustration to the book. Romita once expected Ditko to return to the book within a few months and when he didn't, history was truly made. A history that is now fully explored by writer Tom Spurgeon and this presentation of the definitive book - lavishly illustrated with classic and unseen art - starring Jazzy John Romita! From his days before Marvel, through the Sliver Age, and his days designing and creating the characters we know and love still today (including Wolverine, the Punisher and many, many more), The Romita Legacy covers it all. Spurgeon's exhaustive interview includes not only Romita Sr., but the second beloved artist in the family, John Romita Jr.! \n\n\n'John Romita Jr. 30th Anniversary Special'\nMarvel Comics, 2006, 64 pages\nSketchbook, Interview and Comic\nCover - http://bayimg.com/baNIoaAEj\n\n'Comic Book Profiles 04 John Romita'\nAs You Like It Publications, 1998, 44 pages\nFeaturing interviews with Gerry Conway, Chris Ivy, Stan Lee, Jose Marzan Jr., Graham Nolan, John Romita Jr., Virginia Romita, Jim Shooter, Roy Thomas, Keith Williams and more\nCover - http://bayimg.com/caniaaaej","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d37139f30ea42dcd45a5dddb39c8f76d29076fb","amp;dn":"The+Romita+Legacy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d37139f30ea42dcd45a5dddb39c8f76d29076fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,55,19,159,48,234,66,220,212,90,93,221,179,156,143,118,210,144,118,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
