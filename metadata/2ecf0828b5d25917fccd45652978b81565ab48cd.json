Rush is the 4th installment in the Rush series of video games. The PC version was released on November 4 in Europe. Many details were revealed at E3 in May 2005. The game is free-roaming with races similar to those in Need for Speed: Underground. The GPS map can have a point assigned to a certain location and then the point shows up on the radar during gameplay. The game features voice talent from Orlando Jones, Bill Bellamy, and Twista. In addition to the console versions and PC version it was to be available on Gizmondo. The realistic handling in the game was welcomed by some as being comparable to the handling in Juiced and Need for Speed: Underground 2.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._Rush&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._Rush&lt;/a&gt;\n \n\nFile size = 1.21GB\n\nCD1                      = 737MB\nCD2                      = 502MB\nRead Me                  = 002KB\nStarforce Tools Upgrader = 1.2MB\n\nYou will need:\nDaemon Tools\nWinRAR\n\nPlease share.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ecf0828b5d25917fccd45652978b81565ab48cd","amp;dn":"LA+Rush+%28PC%29+Complete+%5BFull+Game%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ecf0828b5d25917fccd45652978b81565ab48cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,207,8,40,181,210,89,23,252,205,69,101,41,120,184,21,101,171,72,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
