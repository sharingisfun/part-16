But the gorgeous weather belies impending doom, and only one man is worried. The young engineer Marcus Attilius has taken charge of the Aqua Augusta, the enormous aqueduct that brings fresh water to the people around the Bay of Naples. There is a crisis on Augusta's main line--somewhere north of Pompeii, on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius. Attilius must repair the aqueduct before the reservoir runs dry. His plan is to organize an expedition in Pompeii, then head out the the place where he believes the fault lies. But Pompeii proves to be a corrupt and violent town, and Attilius soon discovers that there are powerful forces at work--natural and otherwise--threatening to destroy him.\n\n&quot;A meticulously researched, beautifully written historical thriller of extraordinary breadth and depth...It runs with a force and power fully integrated with its famous subject.&quot;\n--&quot;The Miami Herald&quot;\n\nFrom 9 Audio CDs at 160 kbps in MP3 format.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4ab4de8facbf57dd4dad6cbc187af8ad3b96e3e","amp;dn":"Robert+Harris+-+Pompeii","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4ab4de8facbf57dd4dad6cbc187af8ad3b96e3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,171,77,232,250,203,245,125,212,218,214,203,193,135,175,138,211,185,110,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
