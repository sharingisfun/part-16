Van Ronk&amp;#039;s understated guitar style is perfect for these intimate performances. His naturally rough voice allows him to sing these songs believably without any ethnic affectation or false energy.\n\n4/5 **** \n\n\t  \t1 \t  Candy Man \t          Davis \t2:29\n  \t  \t2 \t  Frankie&amp;#039;s Blues \tVanRonk \t4:36\n  \t  \t3 \t  Bad Dream Blues \tVanRonk \t4:57\n  \t  \t4 \t  Pastures of Plenty \tGuthrie \t3:25\n  \t  \t5 \t  Didn&amp;#039;t It Rain    Traditional \t3:00\n  \t  \t6 \t  Wanderin&amp;#039; \t           Kaye \t2:33\n  \t  \t7 \t  God Bless the Child Herzog, Holiday \t4:22\n  \t  \t8 \t  Blue Monday \t Barth olomew, Domino \t1:59\n  \t  \t9 \t  Baby, Let Me Lay It on You \tDavies \t1:35\n  \t  \t10 \t  House of the Rising Sun \tHolmes, Ray, White \t5:35","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adcf4387743212d89ffeb4da55755f7c5c946668","amp;dn":"%23005+-+Just+Dave+Van+Ronk+%28Dave+Van+Ronk%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adcf4387743212d89ffeb4da55755f7c5c946668","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,207,67,135,116,50,18,216,159,254,180,218,85,117,95,124,92,148,102,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
