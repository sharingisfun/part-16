All an engineer needs to do is connect various validated components to simply and accurately predict multi-disciplinary system performance.\n\nWith extensive dedicated libraries, LMS Imagine.Lab AMESim actually saves enormous amounts of time by eliminating the need for extensive modeling. Thanks to application-specific simulation, engineers can assess a variety of subsystems in multiple physical domains. This way design and engineering teams can carefully balance product performance according to various brand-critical attributes to achieve the best possible design way before committing to expensive and time-consuming prototype testing. Since LMS Imagine.Lab AMESim actually frontloads system simulation early in the development cycle, it truly allows mission-critical design functionality to drive new product development.\n\nLMS.IMAGINE.LAB.AMESIM.R12-MAGNiTUDE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8532e8cdb0f8e4e6a130130eea9e28457b4b0e9c","amp;dn":"LMS+IMAGINE+LAB+AMESIM+R12+-+MAGNiTUDE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8532e8cdb0f8e4e6a130130eea9e28457b4b0e9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,50,232,205,176,248,228,230,161,48,19,14,234,158,40,69,123,75,14,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
