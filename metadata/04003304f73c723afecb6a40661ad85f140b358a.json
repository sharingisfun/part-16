And thus the basis of my sharing to get basically anything I or most anybody has just roam around for awhile snag a load of Discographys and viola you got everything from everybody. Sounds wonderful huh? Im not sure see thats not how I learned and Experianced music I got it an song or album at a time and began to want more got hungry Get it, so I throw out music in varied ways by what Im listening to things Im talking about ,or groups im going to see soon or have already. Anyway theres my reasoning somewhat.....I hope that makes as much sense as It seemed to me,or its time to drink. Peace and sharing cant go wrong............","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04003304f73c723afecb6a40661ad85f140b358a","amp;dn":"Ratt-Out+of+the+Cellar+320kbps+mp3+CDrip+ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04003304f73c723afecb6a40661ad85f140b358a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,0,51,4,247,60,114,58,254,203,106,64,102,26,216,95,20,11,53,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
