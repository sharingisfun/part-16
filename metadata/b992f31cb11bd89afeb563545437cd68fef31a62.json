She was filming her life. That girl loved a guy. But she left him for another. When everything seemed to be fine, she went back to the first guy. Because what that girl fears the most is losing the feeling of love. Some sex scenes filmed with a home camera: the accidental pressing of the REC button at the height of sorting out relationships. The row progresses to sex, confessions of love, and hysteria. Jealousy, outbursts, and reconciliation. Erotic whispers and everyday screams. A home video from a working-class suburb. An unconventional portrayal of youth and the tragedy of first love. An experiment in the area of film language. A film for both Bergman fans and YouTube viewers.\nCountry: Russia\nProduction year: 2012\nFestival: 2012\nDirector: Pavel Kostomarov, Alexandr Rastorguev\nProducer: Andrei Sigle, Pavel Kostomarov, Alexander Rastorguev, Pavel Pechenkin, Vladimir Sokolov, Maxim Tuula\nCast: Viktoria Shevtsova, Yevgeni Borisov, Artem Sotnikov\nDuration: 85 min","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b992f31cb11bd89afeb563545437cd68fef31a62","amp;dn":"I+Don%26rsquo%3Bt+Love+You+%2F+Ja+tiebia+nie+lyublyu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b992f31cb11bd89afeb563545437cd68fef31a62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,146,243,28,177,27,216,154,254,181,99,84,84,55,205,104,254,243,26,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
