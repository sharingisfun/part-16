But there is one true light in his life: his girlfriend, Maria. On their way to school one morning, they are set upon by a vicious street gang. Bobby, beaten bloody and senseless, survives, rescued by an old German man who is himself a survivor of the Nazi death camps. The man calls himself Moishe, though he claims not to be Jewish, and he takes the damaged boy under his wing, determined to help heal his physical and psychological wounds. An unlikely friendship is born, strengthened by a shared sense of loss and lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tragic injustices. But MoisheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s message of learning to forgive the unforgivable falls on deaf ears, because there is a hole in BobbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heart that only revenge can fill.\n\nHubert Selby Jr.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s extraordinary novel is a devastating work of raw power and stylistic brilliance that captures the pain and hardship of twentieth-century urban life. Unflinching and unrelenting, in the vein of his acclaimed masterwork, Last Exit to Brooklyn, SelbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Willow Tree is a dark tale tempered by hope: a story of love, death, rage, violence, and salvation.\n\n\nFormats: EPUB, MOBI, AZW3, PDF\nASIN#: B00DBLREHW\nISBN#: 1480432806\nISBN13#: 9781480432802\nPublished: July 2, 2013\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4244e7b86981bee3f6947a541f0814ad97565df0","amp;dn":"The+Willow+Tree+-+Hubert+Selby","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4244e7b86981bee3f6947a541f0814ad97565df0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,68,231,184,105,129,190,227,246,148,122,84,31,8,20,173,151,86,93,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
