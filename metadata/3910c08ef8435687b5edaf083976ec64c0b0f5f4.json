It is basically a forum for people to tell short personal stories to a live audience. They have a podcast that puts out some of the better ones. This torrent contains a few dozen I have saved up from when I listened to it in 2009/2010. They are mostly pretty awesome.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3910c08ef8435687b5edaf083976ec64c0b0f5f4","amp;dn":"The+Moth+Podcast--+some+from+2009+and+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3910c08ef8435687b5edaf083976ec64c0b0f5f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,16,192,142,248,67,86,135,181,237,175,8,57,118,236,100,192,176,245,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
