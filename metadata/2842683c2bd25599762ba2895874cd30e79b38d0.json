At first it looks like another internet hoax, some lightweight questions were followed by lightweight answers, but then things started changing drastically.Anyone who understands dialectics knows that the answers Insider gave were designed to force/provoke others to ask questions which went to the core of the matter. First some questions are being asked by Insider like &quot;Are you really living on the planet you think you are?&quot; which made people react differently than before.The answers this person started giving to those following questions showed a deep, broad understanding of philosophy, history, metaphysics, religion, magic, politics, and more in a way which is very innovative, detailed and some answers are thought provoking to say the least.What amazes is that Insider answered these questions in a very short time span and if you keep in mind that the topics are diverse, some in depth and some epic answers showed up literally minutes apart, one must wonder how it was done. Copy/paste from internet? I checked intensively and the sentences Insider used cannot be found on internet. Like one person observed, this was way over the heads of the usual suspects.Some people started getting upset, others were drawn to it and this all lead to a dialogue where so much was revealed, including by the other posters that it can be studied for years to come.Sounds hard to believe? Watch on.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2842683c2bd25599762ba2895874cd30e79b38d0","amp;dn":"Revelations+of+an+Elite+Family+Insider","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2842683c2bd25599762ba2895874cd30e79b38d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,66,104,60,43,210,85,153,118,43,162,137,88,116,205,48,231,155,56,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
