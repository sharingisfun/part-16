Content is organized and presented for quick-reference on-the-job or for systematic study of specific topics. Presents general concepts and principles of plant layout -- from basic terminology and input requirements to deliverables; deals with specific pieces of equipment and their most efficient layout in the overall plant design configuration; addresses the plant layout requirements for the most common process unit equipment; covers piping requirements for the entire plant as well as all equipment types; and considers the computerized tools that are now available to help plant layout and piping designers. Features more than 640 illustrations of equipment, piping and other components of processing facility -- and their configurations. MARKETS: For mechanical and chemical engineers working for engineering construction as well as process manufacturing companies with responsibility for plant layout, piping, and construction; and for engineering students","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbf141cfec80ab158aca1c54236dd0046fbfdf68","amp;dn":"Process+Plant+Layout+and+Piping+Design+-+Ed+Bausbacher%2C+Roger+Hu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbf141cfec80ab158aca1c54236dd0046fbfdf68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,241,65,207,236,128,171,21,138,202,28,84,35,109,208,4,111,191,223,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
