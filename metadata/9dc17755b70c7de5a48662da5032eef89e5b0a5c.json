Everything in this talk is verifiable, it is Icke&amp;#039;s best lecture IMO, a lecture of sheer genius. Listen to what he says about John F Kerry and remember he is saying it in 1994 not 2004.\n\nIts not really a case of &quot;David Icke, was he right?&quot; but rather &quot;David Icke was right, period.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dc17755b70c7de5a48662da5032eef89e5b0a5c","amp;dn":"David+Icke+-+The+Robots+Rebellion+%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dc17755b70c7de5a48662da5032eef89e5b0a5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,193,119,85,183,12,125,229,164,134,98,218,80,50,238,248,158,91,10,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
