Bloodsplattering, brain-impaling, flesh-devouring horror. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve probably read your fair share of zombie stories. But this time itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s different. No longer can you sit idle as a bunch of fools make all the wrong moves. All hell is about to break looseÃ¢â‚¬â€and YOU have a say in humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s survival. \n\nYou have choices to make. \n\nMoral dilemmas. \n\nStrategic decisions. \n\nWeapons. Vehicles. \n\nWill you be a hero? \n\nOr will you cover your own ass at all costs? \n\nCan you withstand the coming hours, days, weeks, and months? Or will you die amidst the chaos and violence of a zombie uprising? \n\nOr, worst of all, will you become one of them?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4ef7114c78082aa2724ddb35376869f07324103","amp;dn":"Can+You+Survive+The+Zombie+Apocalypse+-+Max+Brallier","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4ef7114c78082aa2724ddb35376869f07324103","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,239,113,20,199,128,130,170,39,36,221,179,83,118,134,159,7,50,65,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
