Start To Break 04:40\n\n[quote]Atreyu is an American metalcore band from Orange County, California, formed in 1998. \nComing out of Southern California during the rap-metal explosion around the turn of the century, Atreyu crafted a sound much closer to Agnostic Front or Hatebreed. Their warped, detuned guitars are matched by pounding drums and acidic vocals, which give the material an edge otherwise absent from their sludge metal. \nDepression, pain, desire and retribution procreate in a dark, lonely corner of your psyche. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that sordid piece of yourself that you try and hide, deny and bury. Atreyu is embroiled in the struggle to break free from this disenfranchising abyss. Atreyu has taken a new direction in the world of melodic hard rock. They make extreme a little more accessible, emo a little more haunting and severe backed up with a powerful hardcore foundation.[/quote]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd8a55179a967530a978d550f28414efb849cefc","amp;dn":"Atreyu+-+Start+To+Break+%28Single%29+%282015%29+BBM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd8a55179a967530a978d550f28414efb849cefc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,138,85,23,154,150,117,48,169,120,213,80,242,132,20,239,184,73,206,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
