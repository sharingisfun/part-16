This documentary, produced as part of the &quot;Classic Albums&quot; series, takes an in-depth look at the making of this landmark record, as Elton John and lyricist Bernie Taupin discuss the album's stylistically diverse songwriting and production techniques, while a number of the musicians who worked with John on the album also share their memories. In addition, Elton John: Goodbye Yellow Brick Road includes rare film footage and photographs shot during the recording sessions, numbers from Elton's live shows of the 1970s, and demo versions of several of the album's classic songs.AMG\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4d3e4db4677ff3850b59a5b0434491935e4b176","amp;dn":"Classic+Albums%3A+Elton+John+-+Goodbye+Yellow+Brick+Road","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4d3e4db4677ff3850b59a5b0434491935e4b176","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,211,228,219,70,119,255,56,80,181,154,91,4,52,73,25,53,228,177,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
