A victim of technology and circumstance, Simon's memory has been wiped clean, leaving him to rediscover his own identity in a world that is as frightening as unfamiliar, the clues to his personal history few and far between. The path from innocence to recovery takes Simon from planet to planet in a desperate hunt for the truth. Along the way he will befriend snotty robots, baffling alien beings, a precocious kid, and a dog with serious gastrointestinal issues - and he'll find out what kind of a man he really is.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b22e6cfdf7943deddea3fc8c8e84c79bfd69693f","amp;dn":"Simon+of+Space+by+Cheeseburger+Brown","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b22e6cfdf7943deddea3fc8c8e84c79bfd69693f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,46,108,253,247,148,61,237,222,163,252,140,142,132,199,155,253,105,105,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
