While teaching at two London art colleges, I was disturbed by the fact that new work in any particular field of the visual arts was documented and considered in isolation. I felt that it was desirable to correlate many apparently disparate activities. I was aware that the student of graphic design, for instance, might have little knowledge of 'conceptual' or 'minimal' art, and that, on the other hand, the fine-art student could be equally ignorant of developments in 'autonomous typography' or 'ideative design'. By the same token, innovation in audio-visual techniques might elude both groups of students.\nMy purpose, in planning this book, was to meet this need by presenting illustrations of a wide range of recent work in the visual arts, accompanied by texts in which the artists' aims are discussed, in many cases in their own words. When I discovered\nthat several of my friends agreed that such a book would be useful, I decided that the selection of material would be both more objective and more interesting if I invited two other people to collaborate with me on the project.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55d886bd4cb2b48a418d4f2ff422e66506ec9cbd","amp;dn":"Art+Without+Boundaries+1950-70+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55d886bd4cb2b48a418d4f2ff422e66506ec9cbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,216,134,189,76,178,180,138,65,141,79,47,244,34,230,101,6,236,156,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
