With DxO FilmPack , photographers can apply to their digital photos all the characteristic color, contrast, and grain of analog films that made photographic history, along with many original looks, filters, tonings, and visual effects â€” all of which can be infinitely combined and customized. \r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\nDxO image quality for creative photography\r\nSupport for RAW format: perfectly faithful color renderings\r\nNow supporting RAW format, DxO FilmPack uses the calibrated data from your camera to apply analog renderings with perfectly faithful colors. Since the colors in your images havenâ€™t been altered in any way, DxO FilmPackâ€™s exclusive automatic Color protection feature is even more effective. And as it is based on all of DxOâ€™s RAW processing know-how, DxO FilmPack automatically corrects â€” without any intervention on your part â€” all of your equipmentâ€™s possible optical flaws: distortion, vignetting, and chromatic aberrations, all while efficiently reducing the undesirable digital noise in your images.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, processing TIFF and JPEG images is always possible!\r\n\r\nMore than 80 â€œhigh-fidelityâ€ analog film renderings\r\nDxO FilmPack renderings are created in DxOâ€™s laboratories using an exclusive scientific process of exhaustively profiling each film. This process is based on a series of shots of specially-calibrated targets and as well as real-life subjects taken with the film being profiled. The film is then developed by the worldâ€™s most reputable processing laboratories, notably PICTO in France and Duggal in the United States, and is then subjected to high-resolution digitization in order to measure the film response and to extract the grain matrices. This process has allowed DxO to perfectly reproduce â€œhigh-fidelityâ€ rendering of the characteristic appearance, colors, and grains of 83 legendary films â€” color negatives, black &amp; white, slide, and instant snapshots.\r\n\r\n16 new analog film renderings to help you express your creativity\r\nDiscover 16 new analog film renderings among the 80 included in DxO FilmPack 5: films that have disappeared or will soon disappear, creative films, black &amp; white renderings â€¦ To further express your own creativity.\r\n\r\nAdox CHS 100 II â€¢ Adox CMS 20 â€¢ Adox Color Implosion â€¢ Adox Silvermax 21 â€¢ Bergger BRF 400 PLUS â€¢ Foma Fomapan 100 Classic â€¢ Foma Fomapan 100r â€¢ Foma Fomapan 200 Creative â€¢ Foma Fomapan 400 Action â€¢ Fujifilm Instax 120 â€¢ Fujifilm Neopan 400 â€¢ Fuji Superia X-Tra 400 â€¢ Fujicolor Pro 400h â€¢ Ilford Pan 100 â€¢ Ilford Pan 400 â€¢ Kodak Portra 400\r\n\r\nAll the emotion of analog photos\r\nColor renderings: the poetry of analog film applied to digital photos\r\nDxO FilmPack applies to your digital images the saturation, the contrast, and the grain of the most celebrated analog silver halide, slide, and color negative films. Rediscover the sweetness of a Kodak Portra 160 NC for your portraits and events, the magic of a Polaroid so as to imitate old vacation photos, or even the contrast and stunning colors of a Fuji Velvia 50 for macrophotography.
