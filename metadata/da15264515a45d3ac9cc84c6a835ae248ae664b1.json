Gregg \nRead by Shannon Gunn \nFormat: M4B \nBitrate: 128 Kbps \nUnabridged \n\nMax and Finn\nWhen I walked out of his office after the hottest sex of my life, I thought I'd left Max Douglas behind me forever - along with my favorite argyle socks and my self-respect. The last thing I need is the too-serious, too-sexy former Marine living across the hall from me while he acts as a bodyguard for one of my students. Especially since he fired me from my job tutoring his brother...after we hooked up.\nI shouldn't want him. I should despise him after the way he treated me. But he's exactly my type: older, experienced, in control...and it's obvious the lust is still mutual. While I may not be able to keep our relationship strictly professional, I'm determined to keep it purely physical. But when the stalker threats escalate, it looks like Max is going to be sticking around the school for a while - and the more I get to know him, the more I'm in danger of losing my heart.\n\nAdam and Holden\nHolden Worthington's globetrotting days are over. Once the host of a popular adventure show, he hasn't ventured past his own front door in more than a year. Then the arrival of a sexy new gardener sparks something Holden hasn't felt in a very long time - an interest in the world outside his window.\nHolden tries to resist the attraction. But painfully shy yet definitely interested Adam Morgan has Holden longing to conquer his debilitating anxiety and live again. After a grisly discovery on the grounds of the estate, the town of Smithfield turns a suspicious eye on the reclusive Holden - and the two men must trust in each other to bring the truth out in the open.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da15264515a45d3ac9cc84c6a835ae248ae664b1","amp;dn":"Men+of+Smithfield+3-4+Max+and+Finn+%28AKA+Cover+Me%29+Adam+and+Holde","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da15264515a45d3ac9cc84c6a835ae248ae664b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,21,38,69,21,164,93,58,201,204,132,198,168,53,174,36,138,230,100,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
