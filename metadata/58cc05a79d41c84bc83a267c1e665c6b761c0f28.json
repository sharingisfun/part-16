This New York Times bestseller reveals how books in the Bible were actually forged by later authors, and that the New Testament itself is riddled with contradictory claims about Jesusâ€”information that scholars knowâ€¦ but the general public does not. If you enjoy the work of Elaine Pagels, Marcus Borg, John Dominic Crossan, and John Shelby Spong, youâ€™ll find much to ponder in Jesus, Interrupted.\r\n\r\nThis is the Audible file.
