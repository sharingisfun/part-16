Thirty years later, they gather with their families for their coach's funeral and a weekend at a house on a lake where they used to party. By now, each is a grownup with problems and challenges: Marcus is alone and drinks too much. Rob, with three daughters he rarely sees, is always deeply in love until he turns on his next ex-wife. Eric is overweight and out of work. Kurt is a househusband, henpecked by wife and mother-in-law. Lenny is a successful Hollywood agent married to a fashion designer; their kids take privilege for granted. Can the outdoors help these grownups rediscover connections or is this chaos in the making?\n\nSCREENS: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/tmU4TUa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/tmU4TUa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/C6pWMjf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/C6pWMjf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/XNX0wID&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/XNX0wID&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nGrown Ups 2 (2013)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2191701/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2191701/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nIMDB RATING: 5.2\n\nFORMAT.......................: MP4\nCODEC........................: X264 3000 Kbps\nGENRE........................: Comedy\nFILE SIZE....................: 2.29 GB\nRESOLUTION...................: 1280*688 \nFRAME RATE...................: 23.976 fps\nLANGUAGE.....................: English \nSUBTITLES....................: NONE\nRUNTIME......................: 1:40:57\n\n\n\nAfter having the greatest time of his life three summers ago, Lenny (Adam Sandler), decides he wants to move his family back to his hometown and have them grow up with his gang of childhood friends and their kids.
