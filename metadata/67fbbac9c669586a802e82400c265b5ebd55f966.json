This rough-edged, slightly fearsome musical style is often contrasted with the less crude but still powerful presentation of his contemporary and professional rival, Muddy Waters. Howlin' Wolf, Sonny Boy Williamson (Rice Miller), Little Walter Jacobs, Willie Dixon, and Muddy Waters are usually regarded in retrospect as the greatest blues artists who recorded for Chess in Chicago. Sam Phillips once remarked, &quot;When I heard Howlin' Wolf, I said, 'This is for me. This is where the soul of man never dies.'&quot; In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked him #51 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\n\nTracklist\n1. Killing Floor 2:52\n2.
