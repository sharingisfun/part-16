To properly play them, I reccommend\n\tVideo Lan Client (VLC). All videos have been tested using that program.\n\tIf you choose to use mplayer, use the -aid 2 to listen to the second\n\taudio track.\n\nNote About Audio Tracks Regarding File-Sizes\n\tScene rules say that these file sizes are not right... They aren&amp;#039;t... \n\tHowever, if you want to make them right, use a program and \n\tdisable the second audio stream in each AVI, then re-save the \n\t.avi copying the video and audio stream. If you do that, all episodes\n\tfit to 172 MB. \n\t\n\tReason why it&amp;#039;s encoded that way?: 172 MB AVI with 2 audio streams\n\tmeans degraded video quality to fit in 172 MB. The way it&amp;#039;s been \n\tencoded is that the video and audiotrack1 together are a 172 MB AVIs, \n\tand there&amp;#039;s no video quality loss with the adding of the second audio \n\ttrack.\n\nSpeical Thanks Go Out To Tanstaafl for his help on the subtitles!\n\n~HGomez","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4db04ece8c26c165978acf0d9a726b2e221d583","amp;dn":"The.Venture.Bros.Season.2-HGomez","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4db04ece8c26c165978acf0d9a726b2e221d583","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,219,4,236,232,194,108,22,89,120,172,240,217,167,38,178,226,33,213,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
