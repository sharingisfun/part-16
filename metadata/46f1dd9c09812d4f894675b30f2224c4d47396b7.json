Mixed in with the familiar selections was a brand-new track, the playful &quot;Tonight She Comes&quot; (which became a Top Ten hit), as well as a remix of the overlooked &quot;Shake It Up&quot; ballad &quot;I'm Not the One.&quot; And while most of the expected hits are represented (&quot;Just What I Needed,&quot; &quot;Let's Go,&quot; &quot;Drive,&quot; &quot;Shake It Up,&quot; etc.), some of the selections prove questionable -- why was the title track from Heartbeat City (an unsuccessful single) included instead of the 1984 Top 20 hit &quot;Hello Again&quot;? Other missing radio staples include &quot;You're All I've Got Tonight,&quot; &quot;It's All I Can Do,&quot; and the title track from Candy-O, which would have made the collection definitive (all are included on the more extensive Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology from 1995). But for the casual fan, Greatest Hits will do the trick.\nAll Music Review by Greg Prato\n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Just What I Needed\n[02] Since You're Gone\n[03] You Might Think\n[04] Good Times Roll\n[05] Touch And Go\n[06] Drive\n[07] Tonight She Comes\n[08] My Best Friend's Girl\n[09] Heartbeat City\n[10] Let's Go\n[11] I'm Not The One\n[12] Magic\n[13] Shake It Up\n\nCD Play Time - 00h:50m:11s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 329mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
