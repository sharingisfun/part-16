Great! HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a Torrent link to the Compatibility Test Installer (50 MB) that will fire up the Grimrock 2 engine and display a 3D scene while the new Grimrock 2 main menu music plays in the background. We donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the necessary bandwidth to distribute the installer on our servers, so thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why we are using Torrent for distribution.\n\nThe executable will write a log file to Documents/Almost Human/Grimrock2 Compatibility Test/grimrock.log. In case of an error please email this file to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;54323131303635373f143538393b27203c2139353a33353931277a373b39&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; so that we can have a deeper look at the issue. Before sending please make sure that your system meets the minimum system requirements.\n\nNote: if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re running on AMD Radeon and your screen is black but you can hear the music, please check that you do not have antialiasing forced on in your Catalyst driver settings. This is a known issue on some AMD graphics cards.\n\nIf you are so inclined you can also play around with the various graphics settings by editing the config file at Documents/Almost Human/Grimrock2 Compatibility Test/grimrock.cfg. You can delete the file in case you accidentally mess up the file and the test refuses to run.\n\nThank you for your help!\n\nGrimrock 2 Compatibility Test http://www.grimrock.net/2014/10/09/grimrock-2-compatibility-test/\n\n-File From Legend of Grimrock","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89fe3d63de1f8947ca47560a545ae41e0a574a42","amp;dn":"Legend+of+Grimrock+2+Compatibility+Test","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89fe3d63de1f8947ca47560a545ae41e0a574a42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,254,61,99,222,31,137,71,202,71,86,10,84,90,228,30,10,87,74,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
