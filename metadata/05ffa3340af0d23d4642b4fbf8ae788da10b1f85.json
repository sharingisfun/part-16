I thought I would have to wait for a rerun on TV to record and rip, but then I incidentally came across this old, unknown DVD edition in a public library. And behold: It has English subtitles!\n\nThis is the 1973 TV recording which has been passed down as the most accurate interpretation to us Norwegians. It must have been one of the first color productions by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK), and the quality is surprisingly good for a 35 year old recording.\n\nOriginal fullscreen 608x432, COLOR, mono sound.\nDVDrip 2-pass Xvid\nBurn tested, runs well in both my standalone DivX players.\n\nIbsen went himself to Germany to oversee the production of the stage play there, only to be met with fierce opposition by the leading actress, who refused to perform the play with its original ending. A wife simply DID NOT leave her children and her husband at that time! Ibsen had to comply and write another ending for the German public. For the same reasons, the play was originally banned in Britain by the Lord Chamberlain under the 1737 licensing act.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Doll%27s_House&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Doll%27s_House&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTherefore, it would have been very interesting to see Werner Fassbinders German version, uploaded here in May but never seeded: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4165910/Nora_Helmer_(A_Dolls_House)_Fassbinder_Ibsen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4165910/Nora_Helmer_(A_Dolls_House)_Fassbinder_Ibsen&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNorwegian actress Liv Ullman worked for more than five years with her dream to direct a Norwegian-based, international production in English of this celebrated play. Actor candidates were Kate Winslet, Cate Blanchett, Annette Bening and Ralph Fiennes, and the filming was planned to be set in ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¦lesund. The project was officially buried in January 2007 due to animosity and lack of support in the funding process. \nLiv Ullmann actually made her Broadway stage debut in &quot;A Doll's House&quot; in 1975. \n\nFurther Ibsen plays available in the same series:\nEn Folkefiende (An Enemy of the People) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0447638/\nFru Inger til ÃƒÆ’Ã‹Å“strÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥t (Lady Inger of Oestraat) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073021/\nFruen fra havet (The Lady from the Sea) with Liv Ullmann http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080758/\nRosmersholm http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0282925/\nVildanden (The Wild Duck) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283120/\n\nI may consider uploading some of them, pending the reaction to this upload.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Ibsen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Ibsen&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMediaInfo facts about this rip:\n\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 691 MiB\nDuration                         : 2h 26mn\nOveral bit rate                  : 659 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Streaming Video@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default\nMuxing mode                      : Packet Bitstream\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 2h 26mn\nBit rate                         : 521 Kbps\nWidth                            : 608 pixels\nHeight                           : 432 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.407\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nResolution                       : 8 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.079\nStream size                      : 546 MiB\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 2h 26mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nMinimum bit rate                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 134 MiB\nWriting library                  : LAME3.97 \nEncoding settings                : CBR\n\nSource: PAL Native, 7.2 Giga (note that PAL/NTSC will give no problems for avi \nfiles)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05ffa3340af0d23d4642b4fbf8ae788da10b1f85","amp;dn":"A+Dolls+House+%281973%29+Et+dukkehjem+%28DVDrip+Norwegian%2BEngSubs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05ffa3340af0d23d4642b4fbf8ae788da10b1f85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,255,163,52,10,240,210,61,70,66,180,251,248,174,120,141,161,11,31,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
