The dis is mightier than the sword, and Ludacris wastes no time berating Fox News pundit Bill O'Reilly (OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Reilly enticed Pepsi to cut Ludacris off their payroll citing his lyrical irresponsibility). On &quot;Blow It Out,&quot; he taunts his conservative right-winged adversary with lines like, &quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ma start my own beverage/it will calm your nerves/Pepsi, The New Generation/Blow it out ya ass.&quot; Likewise, on &quot;Hoes In My Room,&quot; a slick souled-out collabo with Snoop, he wonders aloud who could have possibly let all of these revolting groupies into his room, post-concert. OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Reilly, who else? To LudacrisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ credit, his third album is more sonically fluid and versatile than Word of Mouf. From the hypnotic first single &quot;Stand Up&quot; to the classy &quot;Diamond in the Back&quot; (yeah, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll forgive him this time for utilizing that vastly overused William Devaughn sample) large chunks of the album are highly listenableÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦subject matter notwithstanding. By the second half of the album he goes full-on debauchery, flipping bushels of potty-mouthed rhymes in poor taste; &quot;Teamwork&quot; is his audio rendition of what a mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nage a trois might feel and sound like, while on &quot;Hip Hop Quotables&quot; he spits about 64 bars with no hooks, once explaining why he canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t find the right lady (&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦a lot of yÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢all are more stuck up than tampons&quot;). Yep, as with any Ludacris record, this one comes with a big phat caveat. If you're not down with the hoes and Heineken (please refer to one-half of album title), you might wanna cop this album and the new Jeru the Damaja for some balance.\n\nAllmusic Review:\nAudacious on his rhymes and indulgent with his appetites, Ludacris may flaunt the cartoonish side of his personality, but he isn't just another unreconstructed Southern rapper. Chicken -N- Beer, his third album (to go along with dozens of guest spots), shows a rapper balancing the weed, women, and fried chicken with shots at those who've crossed him and a look at a few celebrity perils, delivered with his lightning-quick phrasing and cutting wit. That he's able to harness all this to his usual rollicking, all-in-good-fun persona is a testament to the best rapper in the business, one of the few who's actually celebrating something -- and having a great time doing it. The steamy sex rap &quot;Stand Up&quot; may be the hit single, but most of the highlights here come toward the end, where Luda invites friends and family for some uproarious tracks -- producer Erick Sermon on the surrealist dozens of &quot;Hip Hop Quotables,&quot; Snoop Dogg on a hilarious tale of the night after the show, &quot;Hoes in My Room&quot; (as in &quot;Who let these hoes in my room?&quot;), and Disturbing tha Peace partners Chingy, I-20, and Tity Boi on the hardcore gunshot &quot;We Got.&quot; Ludacris also has a response for the doubters, on the first full track (&quot;Blow It Out&quot;), proclaiming, &quot;If you mad I'm on top, then wish me gone/If you mad I'm on the road, then wish me home/And if you mad that I'm right, punk, wish me wrong/But after your third wish, blow it out your ass.&quot; And, as expected, he gets in a few digs at Bill O'Reilly, the FOX News personality who objected to him as a &quot;thug rapper&quot; when hired for a Pepsi ad campaign (apparently, O'Reilly is the culprit behind &quot;Hoes in My Room&quot;). He may not be ready for that Pepsi spot (much less a shot at prime time), but Ludacris made the best record of his career with Chicken -N- Beer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5535b767df4cde2e7ef5b7ad25fa4deffe731f81","amp;dn":"Ludacris+-+Chicken+-N-+Beer+%28Clean%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5535b767df4cde2e7ef5b7ad25fa4deffe731f81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,53,183,103,223,76,222,46,126,245,183,173,37,250,77,239,254,115,31,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
