You pick a high school and two members of its student body to serve as a team as you take on all who challenge you. There are 20 characters to choose from right off the bat, and more become available through victories and solid performance. You can bring in your teammate to perform combos, restore your health, or replenish your Vigor Bar a gauge that provides you the ability to perform special attacks and Team-Up techniques.

With lots of bonuses, secrets, and other hidden goodies, RIVAL SCHOOLS passes with honors.\n\n\nTested and working on all CFW's 5.00 m33 and above using the 500 popsloader pack set on 3.72 POPS...KloWn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9539328519d885c32117eb077f1a7aebecf78c5a","amp;dn":"%28PSX-PSP%29+Rival+Schools%3A+Arcade+%26+Evolution+Discs+converted+prop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9539328519d885c32117eb077f1a7aebecf78c5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,57,50,133,25,216,133,195,33,23,235,7,127,26,122,235,236,247,140,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
