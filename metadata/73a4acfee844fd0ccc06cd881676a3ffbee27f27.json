The series is set in Huntington, West Virginia.\n\nJamie's challenge is to see if he can get a whole community cooking again. He works with the school lunch ladies and local families to get everyone back in the kitchen and making tasty meals with fresh ingredients ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ no packets, no cheating. He's started a Food Revolution: to get people all over America to reconnect with their food and change the way they eat.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73a4acfee844fd0ccc06cd881676a3ffbee27f27","amp;dn":"Jamie+Olivers+Food+Revolution+S01E03","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73a4acfee844fd0ccc06cd881676a3ffbee27f27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,164,172,254,232,68,253,12,204,6,205,136,22,118,163,255,190,226,127,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
