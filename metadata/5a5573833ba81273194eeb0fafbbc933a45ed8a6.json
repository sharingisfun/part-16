The serious reader may be already aware of the plan for a one-world, super-government. It stipulates complete equality for all, that is, reducing every one to the same, lowest human level. To preserve the appearance of individual and national freedom, a superficial form of democracy is being established in all lands; but the control will rest in the hands of the hidden, would-be world rulers. According to plan, religion which exercises a tremendous influence on human lives, is to be homogenized, too. The principal faiths today differ in their conception of God and what is right. Moreover, belief in God, and in truth, freedom, equity, is incompatible with the idea of complete equality, since this belief inspires men to develop their several, innate talents and to rise to higher planes. Hence, in order to homogenize religion, the plan would substitute for the worship of God, the worship of Man. This worship is rooted in many primitive cults. These appeal to the lower instincts, and engender hate, malice, deceit. They are the basis of occultism today. This fascinating book first examines the general character of magic and magical symbolism as it is found in the pagan religions and uses aquired knowledge to deal with various esoteric sects and secret societies. In the chapter on the kabbalah it explores the esoteric doctrine of this &quot;pagan&quot; faith from the perspective of the occult, in order to explain some of the magical practices recorded in ancient Jewish history. Father of Lies shows how some of these primitive faiths deify man, and how they have been embodied in modern esoteric structures. 280 pages, many pictures. A must read for everyone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a5573833ba81273194eeb0fafbbc933a45ed8a6","amp;dn":"Weston-Father+of+Lies-Secret+Jewish+Occult+History+Exposed+%281998","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a5573833ba81273194eeb0fafbbc933a45ed8a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,85,115,131,59,168,18,115,25,78,235,15,175,187,201,51,164,94,216,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
