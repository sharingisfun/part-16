Now they're working together to commit a string of fiendish (and surprisingly elaborate) crimes and it's up to you to stop them.\nTake control of the Dynamic Duo. Play alone or with a friend as Batman and Robin, and use their array of hi-tech suits, vehicles and special abilities to put the crooks behind bars, then switch to other Gotham City crime fighters like Batgirl and Nightwing to finish the job. \nWhen you're done cleaning the streets of Gotham, turn it around and play as any one of a whole range of villains, from Bane and Catwoman to Two-Face and The Riddler, and find out how much fun it is to steal giant lasers and plant penguin minions all over the city using villainous vehicles and super-skills like mind control.\nThere is no rest for the good (or evil)!\n\n.: Software Data :. \nDeveloper: Traveller's Tales\nPublisher: Feral Interactive\nRelease Date: 30 Settembre 2008\nGenre: Platform\nMode of Play: Single player\nPlatform: Mac\nGraphical Engine: Odissey engine\nLanguage: English, Danish, French, German, Italian, Spanish\nSize: 4.10Gb\n\n.: System requirements :. \nOperative System: Mac OS X 10.6.x or greater\nCPU: Intel Processor 1.4GHz or faster\nMemory: 1 GB or greater\nHard drive Space: 4.65GB \nVideo Memory (VRam): 128 MB  or greater\n\n.: Instructions :. \n-Open DMG\n-Drag and Drop the Game folder in your application folder\n-Enjoy ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02e294c3a0475d757654195b50b982dc64de82d9","amp;dn":"LEGO+Batman+Mac+%5BDMG+-+MultiLang%5D%5BTNT+Village%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02e294c3a0475d757654195b50b982dc64de82d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,226,148,195,160,71,93,117,118,84,25,91,80,185,130,220,100,222,130,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
