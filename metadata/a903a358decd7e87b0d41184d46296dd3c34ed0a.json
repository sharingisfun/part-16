This Brittish guy is freakin hilarious and will make damn-near anybody giggle. Interstingly enough, he's been doing stand-up for 18 years, but this is his first DVD special... Anyway, the original notes about this are as follows:\nSimon Evans debut DVD is a master class in aloof, patrician observational stand up. To the delight of a packed audience, the star of Live At The Apollo and Stand Up For The Week brings a little polish to the Theatre Royal Brighton. Evans looks back at his life and times, from his early days in London to his family life by the seaside. Along the way, his reflections are as ever as dry and delicious as a good Sancerre, or perhaps a really good radish.\n\nTech details:\n720x404@25fps@~850kbps\n2ch Stereo AAC@~192kbps\nContains the DVD chapters;o)\n\nHere's the DVD cover:\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/oLRtJ7d.jpg[/img]\n\nHere's a screenshot:\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/gIxYZxq.jpg[/img]\n\nHere's some thumbs:\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/qbOhrjc.jpg[/img]\n\nEnjoy and don't forget2seed;o)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a903a358decd7e87b0d41184d46296dd3c34ed0a","amp;dn":"Simon.Evans.Live.2014.Live.at.the.Theatre.Royal.DVDrip.x264-HAGG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a903a358decd7e87b0d41184d46296dd3c34ed0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,3,163,88,222,205,126,135,176,212,17,132,212,98,150,221,60,52,237,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
