Alone, he must bear the weight of a sin he dare not confess to the one person he loves?and has lost.\n\nJoin Richard and Kahlan in the concluding novel of one of the most remarkable and memorable journeys ever written. It started with one rule, and will end with the rule of all rules, the rule unwritten, the rule unspoken since the dawn of history.\n\nWhen next the sun rises, the world will be forever changed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba25e5f59b85f98c045c5f93366db9b8239945d3","amp;dn":"Terry+Goodkind-Confessor+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba25e5f59b85f98c045c5f93366db9b8239945d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,37,229,245,155,133,249,140,4,92,95,147,54,109,185,184,35,153,69,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
