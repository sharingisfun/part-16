If from that description you suspect this album of synthesizer ballads is laid-back, you&amp;#039;d be right, but there is enough melodic intrigue to keep things interesting. &quot;Dazzled by the Light&quot; is a smooth cha-cha featuring Real Music label-mate Govi on lead guitar. (He also shows up on the jazzy &quot;Blessings Rain,&quot; and lays down a Spanish-style solo in &quot;Follow Your Heart.&quot;). &quot;The Peace Within&quot; plays like one of John Tesh&amp;#039;s more uplifting ballads. The best composition here is &quot;Sapphire,&quot; an engaging slice of melodicism with flute-like voicing and infectious percussion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f6cd6a0cbf3f3e314ea75b3ce7ef0d6fd9daa4d","amp;dn":"Karunesh+-+Nirvana+Cafe+CD+%2B+Covers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f6cd6a0cbf3f3e314ea75b3ce7ef0d6fd9daa4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,108,214,160,203,243,243,227,20,234,117,179,206,126,240,214,253,157,170,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
