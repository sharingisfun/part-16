The authors consolidate all important information in this interdisciplinary technology, including the fundamental concepts, mathematical modeling, theoretical analysis, computer simulation, and hardware implementation. The book provides comprehensive coverage of chaos in electric drive systems with three main parts: analysis, control and application. Corresponding drive systems range from the simplest to the latest types: DC, induction, synchronous reluctance, switched reluctance, and permanent magnet brushless drives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:447a7e814fe763a29ba13ddc606136f3d916dd88","amp;dn":"Chaos+In+Electric+Drive+Systems%3A+Analysis%2C+Control+%26+Application","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"447a7e814fe763a29ba13ddc606136f3d916dd88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,122,126,129,79,231,99,162,155,161,61,220,96,97,54,243,217,22,221,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
