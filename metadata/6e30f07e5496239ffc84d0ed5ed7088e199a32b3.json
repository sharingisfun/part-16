For the better part of the past decade, though, he has been making sweet, sweet noise with the Pink Monkey Birds. Not unlike a punk-infused version of the Spiders from Mars, from whom they derive their name, the Pink Monkey Birds are in the business of sleazy rock music. And while Gorilla Rose isnt exactly Ziggy Stardust, it is a brilliant album, the likes of which hardly ever comes around these days.
