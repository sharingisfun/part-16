But are they? The answer to this question has enormous consequences, since residential and commercial buildings together account for nearly 50% of American energy consumptionÃ¢â‚¬â€including at least 75% of electricity usageÃ¢â‚¬â€according to recent government statistics.\nThis eye-opening book reports the results of a large-scale study based on extensive financial and technical analyses of more than 150 green buildings in the U.S. and ten other countries. It provides detailed findings on the costs and financial benefits of building green. According to the study, green buildings cost roughly 2% more to build than conventional buildingsÃ¢â‚¬â€far less than previously assumedÃ¢â‚¬â€and provide a wide range of financial, health and social benefits. In addition, green buildings reduce energy use by an average of 33%, resulting in significant cost savings.\nGreening Our Built World also evaluates the cost effectiveness of Ã¢â‚¬Å“green community developmentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and presents the results of the first-ever survey of green buildings constructed by faith-based organizations. Throughout the book, leading practitioners in green designÃ¢â‚¬â€including architects, developers, and property ownersÃ¢â‚¬â€share their own experiences in building green. A compelling combination of rock-solid facts and specific examples, this book proves that green design is both cost-effective and earth-friendly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e73cd8c93729a916e9e2fa4a3804848db689f68d","amp;dn":"Greening+Our+Built+World+-+Costs%2C+Benefits+and+Strategies+%28Males","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e73cd8c93729a916e9e2fa4a3804848db689f68d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,60,216,201,55,41,169,22,233,226,250,74,56,4,132,141,182,137,246,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
