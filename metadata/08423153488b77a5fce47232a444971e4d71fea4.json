Completed in the spring \nof 1918, Socrate is a typical eccentric piece from avant-garde pioneer Erik Satie. \nWritten in three movements for voice (four sopranos) and small orchestra \n(or piano), the text is extracted from three Platonic dialogues and depicts the last days of the Greek philosopher Socrates, condemned to death for corrupting the young men of Athens.  The subtitle 'symphonic drama' belies the understatement and economy of Socrate, which Satie aimed to make 'white and pure like antiquity.' To achieve this, Satie claimed that he ate only white foods.  Socrate itself lasts for 30 minutes, and is augmented by five short song cycles written by the composer between 1886 and 1923: Trois Melodies (1886), Trois Autres Melodies, Trois Melodies (1916), Quatres Petite Melodies (all 1920) and the absurdist Ludions ('bottle imps') from 1923, the latter with lyrics by poet LÃƒÂ©on-Paul Fargue.  The 61 minute recording was made at All Saints Church, Petersham. Sopranos Susan Bickley, Eileen Hulse and Patricia Rosario perform with pianist Robin Bowman and conductor Richard Bernas.\n\n\nStephen Eddins @ allmusic.com:\nSatie's Socrate defies easy categorization. The composer described it a &quot;symphonic drama,&quot; but it has little dramatic action that would lend itself to a staging of the piece. The first movement, &quot;Portrait of Socrates,&quot; consists of Alcibiades' speech in praise of Socrates, and the philosopher's single line of gratitude. In the second movement, &quot;On the Banks of the Illicus,&quot; Socrates and Phaedrus wander along a stream on a beautiful summer day, commenting on the joys of nature and pondering the veracity of mythological events alleged to have taken place at this spot. The final movement, &quot;Death of Socrates,&quot; is a monologue in which Phaedo describes Socrates' last hours. Since its premiere, Socrate has generated great debate over its merits: is it a brilliantly understated and original approach to the relationship between text and music, or a pallid bore in which little of musical interest transpires? Much has been made of its unruffled surface, which contains no big emotional climaxes commensurate with the gravity of the subject matter. In fact, Satie's music is full of expressiveness that reflects the subtleties of the text, but his expressive range is so much more circumscribed than most composers' that it requires close attention, or it may easily be missed. \nThe languid, meandering, repetitive music that accompanies Socrates' paean to nature, for instance, is a felicitous musical analog for the experience of lingering happily and purposelessly in the warm grass by a stream in the summer. The description of Socrates' death is fully expressive in its own terms. By raising the melodic line by a single tone, or adding a single instrument to a chord, Satie can economically evoke the mounting tension as surely a more conventional composer might do with a huge orchestral crescendo. \nRichard Bernas leads Music Projects London in a nuanced and atmospheric performance that accentuates the subtle drama in Satie's music. Sopranos Susan Bickley, Eileen Hulse, and Patricia Rosario sing with elegance and purity, expressing deep emotion even in their restrained performances. Hulse and Rosario, accompanied by pianist Robin Bowman, fill out the CD with a generous selection of Satie's delightful, musically varied songs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08423153488b77a5fce47232a444971e4d71fea4","amp;dn":"Erik+Satie+-+Socrate+%2B+Melodies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08423153488b77a5fce47232a444971e4d71fea4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,66,49,83,72,139,119,165,252,228,114,50,164,68,151,30,77,113,254,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
