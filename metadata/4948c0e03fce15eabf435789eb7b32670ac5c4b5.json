Visit the dark recesses of the world corrupted by crime, greed, degradation, and dishonor. Your contracts will take you to exotic locations around the globe including Sicily, St. Petersburg, Japan, Malaysia, and India. A diverse arsenal of equipment, from armor-piercing rifles and explosives to chloroform and poison darts, are at your disposal. Stalk and eliminate your targets up close and personal, in either first- or third-person perspectives. You must decide whether to use stealth or aggression, but be careful--you'll have to deal with the consequences.\n\nHitman: Contracts - Explore the dark psychology of killing for a living as you delve into the mind of a ruthless and efficient contract killer. Hitman: Contracts delivers more action-packed missions that require you to eliminate targets from England to China. Now you have a greater variety of ways to make the perfect hit and an increased arsenal of firearms and close-combat weapons at your disposal. Pick up objects like meat hooks, pool cues, shovels, and pillows to use as weapons, and then admire your &quot;work&quot; showcased in brutal detail.\n\nHitman: Blood Money - Hitman is back and this time he's paid in cold, hard cash. The Blood Money he earns affects his passage through the game and the weapons at his disposal, resulting in a unique gameplay experience for each player. Powered by a new version of lo's stunning Glacier engine, Hitman: Blood Money will deliver the most brutal and realistic simulation of life as the world's deadliest assassin.\n\n[INSTALL]\nTo unpack , use the 7 -Zip or WinRAR\nBurn with Nero or UltraISO.\nBurn to disc DVD-5 or 4x Speed\nEnjoy!
