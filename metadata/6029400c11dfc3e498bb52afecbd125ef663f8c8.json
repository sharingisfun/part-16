But the influence of her father, a violent psychopath with mind-altering abilities, lives on. Her advisors, who have run things since Leck died, believe in a forward-thinking plan: Pardon all who committed terrible acts under Leck's reign, and forget anything bad ever happened. But when Bitterblue begins sneaking outside the castle--disguised and alone--to walk the streets of her own city, she starts realizing that the kingdom has been under the thirty-five-year spell of a madman, and the only way to move forward is to revisit the past.\n\nTwo thieves, who only steal what has already been stolen, change her life forever. They hold a key to the truth of Leck's reign. And one of them, with an extreme skill called a Grace that he hasn't yet identified, holds a key to her heart.\n\n\n\nProduct Details:\n\nReading level: Ages 14 and up\nHardcover: 576 pages\nPublisher: Dial (May 1, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0803734735\nISBN-13: 978-0803734739\nFormat: PDF\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6029400c11dfc3e498bb52afecbd125ef663f8c8","amp;dn":"Bitterblue+-+Graceling+Series+-+Kristin+Cashore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6029400c11dfc3e498bb52afecbd125ef663f8c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,41,64,12,17,223,195,228,152,187,82,175,236,189,18,94,246,99,248,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
