Stylistically her music is not classical chanson, but is closer to a mixture of pop music, cabaret, jazz and chanson. \n\nIn 1997 Dans ma chair (Eng: In my flesh) was made. It was produced in New York by Kaas and Phil Ramone, who had previously worked with Ray Charles, Billy Joel and Paul Simon. The album marked the second time the singer officially worked with the French songwriter Jean-Jacques Goldman (they began to work together in 1993 for the song &quot;Il me dit que je suis belle&quot;.) The collaboration with Goldman, which continues to this day, was one of the most important of Kaas' career.\n\nFurther contributors to the success of the album were the American songwriter and singer Lyle Lovett, with the song Chanson simple (Eng: Simple song), and James Taylor with Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight, on which he duetted with Kaas. The track Quand j'ai peur de tout (Eng: When I'm afraid of everything), written by Diane Warren, was later remade in 2003 by the band Sugababes under the name Too Lost In You.\n\nIn 1998, following the Dans ma chair tour, the live album and video cassette (later a DVD) Rendez-vous was produced. Among the tracks are L'aigle noir (Eng: The black eagle) by the French singer and songwriter Barbara, whom Kaas had admired for a long time.\n\n\nTrack list:\n\n01 Quand J'Ai Peur de Tout\n02 Dans Ma Chair\n03 Chanson, Simple\n04 J'Ai Tout Quitte Pour Toi\n05 Je Me Sourveins de Rien\n06 Les Lignes de Nos Mains\n07 Je Sais\n08 Je Voudrais la ConnaÃƒÂ®tre\n09 Fais-Moi l'Amitie\n10 L' Amour Devant la Mer\n11 Je Compte Jusqu'a Toi\n12 Sans Toi\n13 Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d82d5ed2010a95c16a0e0e4490140792b415ded","amp;dn":"Patricia+Kaas+Dans+Ma+Chair","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d82d5ed2010a95c16a0e0e4490140792b415ded","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,130,213,237,32,16,169,92,22,160,224,228,73,1,64,121,43,65,93,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
