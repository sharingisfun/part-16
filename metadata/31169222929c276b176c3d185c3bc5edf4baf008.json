For Lynn, getting into that character involved co- writing appropriately bleak material with Rosanne Cash and T-Bone Burnett, world-class producer of evocative soundtracks; surrendering herself to half a dozen stylists tasked with mussing her hair, ripping her clothes and hollowing her eyes and cheekbones; and, as she put it to one interviewer, â€œjust trying to sing with as little affect as possible.â€ The effect was that of a soul whoâ€™d reached a dead end and was just as dead on the inside.\r\nIn the music sheâ€™s made under her own name,Lynn has favored melancholy, too, but her album Resistor is alive to experience beneath the shadows. Having entered Burnettâ€™s circle, she might have been expected to record this set with him and his stable of sought-after studio talent. Instead, she stuck to her longtime partnership with Nashville guitarist Joshua Grange; the two of them co-produced and played nearly all of the instruments. Within that self-sufficient, seemingly insular dynamic, they found room to explore richly sensual minimalism.\r\n\r\nThe mellow, rootsy funk of one of their new tracks, â€œLittle Ruby,â€ distantly echoes J.J. Cale, while a couple of others, â€œShape Shifterâ€ and â€œDrive,â€ belong to the pop-smart alt-rock lineage of Garbage and Butterfly Boucher. Really, though, with each successive release â€” her 2011 debut Have You Met Lera Lynn?, the Lying In The Sun EP, 2014â€™s The Avenues and this latest one â€” Lynn has moved further and further from the torch-and-twang territory and Americana affinities with which she was first associated. The transition has been smooth, given that she never identified all that closely with country and folk songwriting traditions that rely on lyrics to set a mood; sheâ€™s about lovely, low-spirited melodies and atmospheric, enveloping performances.\r\n\r\nThe suppleness of Lynnâ€™s phrasing betrays an interest in jazz; witness her savoring syllables and wilting notes in â€œSlow Motion Countdownâ€ and â€œCut + Burn.â€ To describe her singing approach as a vocal attack wouldnâ€™t ring true â€” itâ€™s more like a vocal caress, a suggestive softness, a physicality made more alluring by the way she withholds its full force.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n01 Shape Shifter.flac\r\n02 What You Done.flac\r\n03 Drive.flac\r\n04 Cut + Burn.flac\r\n05 Run The Night.flac\r\n06 For The Last Time.flac\r\n07 Fade Into Black.flac\r\n08 Slow Motion Countdown.flac\r\n09 Scratch + Hiss.flac\r\n10 Little Ruby.flac01 Shape Shifter.flac\r\n02 What You Done.flac\r\n03 Drive.flac\r\n04 Cut + Burn.flac\r\n05 Run The Night.flac\r\n06 For The Last Time.flac\r\n07 Fade Into Black.flac\r\n08 Slow Motion Countdown.flac\r\n09 Scratch + Hiss.flac\r\n10 Little Ruby.flac\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCountry: USA\r\nGenre: Indie-Folk\r\n\r\n\r\nMedia Report:\r\nSource : CD\r\nFormat : FLAC\r\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nBit rate : ~671-886 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\r\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31169222929c276b176c3d185c3bc5edf4baf008","amp;dn":"%282016%29+Lera+Lynn+-+Resistor+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31169222929c276b176c3d185c3bc5edf4baf008","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,22,146,34,146,156,39,107,23,108,61,24,92,59,197,237,244,186,240,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
