A mobile version was developed by IG Fun.[14] The game's concept was developed by Irrational's creative lead, Ken Levine, and was based on the ideas of Objectivism as highlighted by Ayn Rand, while incorporating influences from other authors such as George Orwell. The game is considered a spiritual successor to the System Shock series, which many of Irrational's team including Levine had worked on previously.[15][16]\n\nBioShock is set in 1960, in which the player guides Jack after his airplane crashes in the ocean near the bathysphere terminus that leads to the underwater city of Rapture. Built by the business magnate Andrew Ryan, the city was intended to be an isolated utopia, but the discovery of ADAM, a plasmid which grants superhuman powers, initiated the city's turbulent decline. Jack tries to find a way to escape, fighting through hordes of ADAM-obsessed enemies such as the deadly Big Daddies, while engaging with the few sane humans that remain and eventually learning of Rapture's past. The player, as Jack, is able to defeat foes in a number of ways by using weapons, utilising plasmids that give unique powers and by turning Rapture's own defenses against them. BioShock includes elements of survival horror and role-playing games, giving the player different approaches in engaging enemies such as by stealth, as well as moral choices of saving or killing characters.\n\nBioShock was praised by critics for its &quot;morality-based&quot; storyline, immersive environment and its unique setting. Since its release, a direct sequel, BioShock 2 by 2K Marin, was released, while a third game entitled BioShock Infinite by Irrational Games is presently under development, though it is only thematically connected to the previous titles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0110f88a5486688381b63cb28a148f6753260e19","amp;dn":"BioShock+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0110f88a5486688381b63cb28a148f6753260e19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,16,248,138,84,134,104,131,129,182,60,178,138,20,143,103,83,38,14,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
