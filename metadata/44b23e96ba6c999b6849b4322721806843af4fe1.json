For her â€˜cooking, eating and growing in the wonderful culture of foodâ€™ is an integral part of the fun of life. This philosophy is reflected in her ideas and recipes for meals for babies upwards of four months, as well as dishes suitable for the whole family. There is an emphasis on organic food and most of the 70-odd recipes are wheat- and sugar-free with many dairy-, egg- and gluten-free options as well. You will find new ideas and healthy combinations, using simple and inexpensive ingredients. The text will appeal to all parents as it encourages without being prescriptive, yet it is simple and practical to eliminate guesswork when it comes to feeding babies and children","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44b23e96ba6c999b6849b4322721806843af4fe1","amp;dn":"Cook+Eat+Love+Grow+%282012%29+%28Pdf%2C+Epub+and+Mobi%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44b23e96ba6c999b6849b4322721806843af4fe1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,178,62,150,186,108,153,155,104,73,180,50,39,33,128,104,67,175,79,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
