Female viewers can admire the gutsiness of Terry Moore's character as a waitress named Kotty. (Now THERE is a dame who knows how to handle sexual harassment!) Meanwhile, male viewers can sympathize with the dilemma of all those poor lonely men onscreen who have to live with the fact that the only women for miles around can't stand them. The climax of &quot;Shack Out&quot; is beyond belief: Your jaw will either be NAILED to your chin or you'll be in such uncontrollable hysterics that you may have to SLAP yourself. (Thanks, I needed that!) If the late, great Tex Avery had ever made a live action feature, it might have looked like this one. Don't miss &quot;Shack Out&quot;, co-starring Frank Lovejoy as The Professor, Keenan Wynn as George &amp; the ubiquitous Whit Bissell as Eddie.\n\nCheck your sensibilities, noir or otherwise, at the door of one the weirdest, wildest and most wonderful films to ever come around the bend of any coastside highway. Shack Out On 101 is one of those cult nuggets harpoons you from its opening shot and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll feel like youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve missed out on something special from the depths of cinema history all these years.\n\nIt is all but impossible to dislike this ultra-cheap &quot;Cold War paranoia&quot; melodrama. Virtually the entire picture takes place on a single set, representing a rundown roadside diner.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 2,89gb\nDuration.... 01:20:48\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 1280\nFrame Height.... 720\nData Rate.... 5008kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 128kbps....
