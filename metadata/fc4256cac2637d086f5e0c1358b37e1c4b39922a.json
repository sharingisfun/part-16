According to records I've found, there is a hidden transportation system that leads to a second connection to the outside world. In order to activate this system and also to ensure your own return, you must find all nine fragments of the key to the system.\n\nHow to play:\n1) Run rhem4_setup.exe and install the game;\n2) Start the game using its main executable or shortcuts.\n\n! Notice\nYou need to have QuickTime installed to view the in-game cinematics. I've included QuickTime Alternative with the game, you can install it by running QuickTime_Alternative_322.exe.\n\n\nIf you like the game, BUY it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc4256cac2637d086f5e0c1358b37e1c4b39922a","amp;dn":"RHEM++4++The++Golden++Fragments","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc4256cac2637d086f5e0c1358b37e1c4b39922a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,66,86,202,194,99,125,8,111,94,12,19,88,179,126,28,75,57,146,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
