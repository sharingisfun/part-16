Past installments of the annual holiday have seen the band release a full cover of Pink FloydÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Dark Side of a Moon, a collaborative LP titled Heady Fwends, a toy frog containing the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first demo, a life-size chocolate human skull, and a variety of similar ambitious and wacky releases. So, what do the Lips have on tap for Record Store Day 2014, set for April 19th?\nThe band release a vinyl edit of 7 Skies H3, which you may know best as the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 24-hour long song. Ã¢â‚¬Å“7 Skies H3? was first premiered online for Halloween 2011 and 17 copies were later released on flash drives encased in human skulls, each of which sold for $5,000.\n\nThe vinyl edit due out for Record Store Day features a 43-minute version of the song Ã¢â‚¬â€ or, as the band describe it, an Ã¢â‚¬Å“extraction and reduction.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The release was mastered by Dave Fridmann, engineered by Michael Ivins, and features artwork from longtime Ã¢â‚¬Å“visualistÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ George Salsibury.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe165a17634f37fce7857b8b39825301572340db","amp;dn":"The+Flaming+Lips+-+7+Skies+H3+%282014%29+%5BRecord+Store+Day%5D+MP3%40256k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe165a17634f37fce7857b8b39825301572340db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,22,90,23,99,79,55,252,231,133,123,139,57,130,83,1,87,35,64,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
