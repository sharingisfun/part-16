See what happens when greed really takes over, tightening it's grip slowly, steadily, tighter and tighter! Lizabeth Scott is more wicked than anyone could have expected, least of all the men in her life. A very naughty girl, indeed: just the kind of babe a guy like me needs to lead his noir-lifestyle. Until she plugs me, that is!\n\nAlso starring Arthur Kennedy, Don DeFore and Dan Duryea. Barry Kelly (Asphalt Jungle) plays yet another cop role, and Kristine Miller gives Scott a run for her money in the beauty department. \n\n*********************\n\n\nPlease seed at least 1:1, a bit more if you can.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22a1b3ef1373487cc6a7b84bb9dc17374a9eba90","amp;dn":"Too+Late+For+Tears+%281949+film+noir%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22a1b3ef1373487cc6a7b84bb9dc17374a9eba90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,161,179,239,19,115,72,124,198,167,184,75,185,220,23,55,74,158,186,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
