Directed by acclaimed documentary filmmaker Robert Mugge, Black Wax is a fascinating 79-minute portrait of Scott-Heron performing at the Wax Museum nightclub, D.C. in 1982, interspersed between scenes of him discussing political ironies as he wanders past national monuments and ghetto neighbourhoods in Washington.\n\nThe poet, vocalist, and songwriter Gil Scott-Heron is both the descendant of the African griots and the forefather of rap. In the early '70s, he boldly proclaimed that &quot;the revolution will not be televised,&quot; and in the '80s he warned us of the &quot;New World Order&quot; with his prophetic and satirical single, &quot;B Movie.&quot; The gifted filmmaker Mugge alternates between the electrifying soul/jazz/funk grooves of Scott- Heron's Midnight Band and his witty and deep monologues about racial politics with a wax figure of Uncle Sam and his dead-on commentaries on urban life in the nation's capital.\n\nIncluded is the bonus selection &quot;Is That Jazz,&quot; Heron's swinging shout-out to the jazz legends and a rebuke of those who try to limit it. Nobody tells it like it is like Gil Scott-Heron, and nobody ever will. This is a great release for any fan of the man and his music.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1935 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x536\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.313:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 1:41:32\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1,51 GiB\nRipped by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d168625a325d3a9631bb420a806485a120115be2","amp;dn":"Channel4.Gil.Scott-Heron.Black.Wax.XviD.AC3.MVGroup.Forum.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d168625a325d3a9631bb420a806485a120115be2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,104,98,90,50,93,58,150,49,187,66,10,128,100,133,161,32,17,91,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
