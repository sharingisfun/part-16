No other package out there makes it as easy to incorporate all of the special features and effects you see in todays games and no other package natively offers the benefits of Microsofts DirectX 9 technology. \n\n\n\n \nPixel &amp; Vertex Shader Support\nNVIDIA and ATI&amp;#039;s powerful new graphics cards have inspired us to support both Pixel and Vertex shaders. You have full and direct control of these awesome hardware effects from within DarkBASIC Professional. Pixel Shaders are used to alter lighting and surface effects that replace artificial, computerized looks with materials and surfaces that mimic reality. \n\n\n \nVertex Shaders are used to breathe life and personality into characters and environments. For example, through vertex shading you can create true-to-life dimples or wrinkles that appear when a character smiles or you can ripple shockwaves through a land matrix. The illustration above shows 6 different DarkBASIC Professional shaders in action.\n\n\nDoes &quot;Professional&quot; Mean Harder To Learn?\nNot when it comes to DarkBASIC Professional. &quot;Professional&quot; to us means that you get all of the benefits of the original DarkBASIC language, so you can write games with ease. But you also get the lower-level control and extras you would expect from a Professional language. There are an increased range of Data Types, a far more advanced 3D Engine with low level access to Object data. You can utilise vector and matrix manipulation via the 3D Maths commands and many other advanced features that are there if you need them. \n\nDarkBASIC Professional will grow with you as you learn new development skills and extend your 3D knowledge, so you can unlock the benefits of the more advanced areas of the language. Even if you master all of the 1000+ commands on offer you can extend DarkBASIC Professional with your own DLLs which allow you to create custom commands. \n\n\nKey Features\nDarkBASIC Professional is an extremely powerful and versatile package.
