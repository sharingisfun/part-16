On prominent campuses across the United States and throughout the world, petitions circulate asking universities to divest holdings in Israel and to boycott Israeli Jews without regard to their individual views. Virulent opponents of Israel have accused that democracy of unspeakable human rights abuses, while many who believe otherwise remain silent. Now, in this impassioned and closely argued book, Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz sets the record straight and explains why Israel, while not perfect, is in fact the sole outpost of liberty and democracy in the Middle EastÃ¢â‚¬â€œa country that has earned the right to exist within secure boundaries and defend itself.\n\nDrawing on scrupulous, unbiased research and his peerless skills as an advocate, Dershowitz conclusively refutes thirty-two separate slurs, slanders, and misrepresentations that have been hurled at Israel in recent years, including:\n\n    Israel is a colonial, imperialist state\n    The Jews have always rejected the two-state solution\n    The Jews have exploited the Holocaust\n    IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s victimization of the Palestinians has been the primary cause of the Arab-Israeli conflict\n    Israel created the Arab refugee problem\n    Israel tortures Palestinians\n    IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s targeted assassinations of terrorist leaders are unlawful\n    Israel is the &quot;prime&quot; human rights violator in the world\n    Universities should divest from Israel and boycott Israeli scholars\n\nIn demolishing these charges, Dershowitz documents how Israel was founded with the blessing of the United NationsÃ¢â‚¬â€œand how it was Arabs, not Israelis, who initiated the cycle of violence that still persists today. He proves that the division of Palestine between Israel and the Palestinians has long been accepted by Israel and rejected by most Arabs. He demonstrates why Israeli actions in the West Bank and Gaza are not motivated by territorial ambitions, but by the very real sense that Israel is under attack. And he shows how critics of Israel gloss over the terrorism, human rights abuses, and antidemocratic ideologies of other regimes in the region, substituting bigotry and veiled anti-Semitism for objective analysis. Well reasoned, hard-hitting, and provocative, The Case for Israel is essential reading for anyone who cares about Israel and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. \n\n\nAbout the author:\n Alan Dershowitz is a Felix Frankfurter professor of law at Harvard Law School, one of the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foremost appellate lawyers, and a distinguished defender of individual liberties.
