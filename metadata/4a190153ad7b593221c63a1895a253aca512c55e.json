When JasonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dad gets a new boat, the boys decide to take it for a joyride and get caught in a swirling vortex that brings them to Stormworld. This new world is a parallel universe with three suns, mind-distorting storms, and wild coastlines, surrounded by a hostile environment where drinkable water is precious and food is limited.\n\nThe boys are rescued by Flees and her pedantic companion, Ogee. Flees has one of the few serviceable watercrafts on Stormworld and grudgingly volunteers to take the new visitors to a small community trying to create civilization and order against the forces of nature and scavengers. One thing is constant for Jason, Lee, and almost everyone on Stormworld: the search for the way home.\n\nThis show is a joint Canada/Australian production.  The show is shot on location in Australia and Singapore.  Most of the cast is Australian including the brillant Valentina Barron (Streetsmartz, Wormwood).  \n\nAlthough the first episode was a bit shakey and received some justified criticism, the show has improved greatly with subsequent episodes.  Try it you'll like it.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.spacecast.com/Shows/stormworld.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.spacecast.com/Shows/stormworld.aspx&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a190153ad7b593221c63a1895a253aca512c55e","amp;dn":"Stormworld+-+S01E17+%28starring+Valentina+Barron%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a190153ad7b593221c63a1895a253aca512c55e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,25,1,83,173,123,89,50,33,198,58,24,149,162,83,172,165,18,197,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
