Includes the BBC Radio CD collections 'Winnie the Pooh', 'The House at Pooh Corner' and 'A Party for Pooh'. I believe these 3 were also released in a single box set titled 'The Collection'.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09d75ee76d299bcb21067e2be02e4d9296626425","amp;dn":"Winnie+the+Pooh+read+by+Alan+Bennett","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09d75ee76d299bcb21067e2be02e4d9296626425","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,215,94,231,109,41,155,203,33,6,126,43,224,46,77,146,150,98,100,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
