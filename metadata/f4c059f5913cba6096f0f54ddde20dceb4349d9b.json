My goal is to provide a city building game that rivals roguelikes in terms of difficulty and randomization. You start the game with a procedurally generated terrain and are given a small group of workers and resources. To survive, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to collect food and building materials. The more wealth you amass, the more likely youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be besieged by marauding goblin hordes or by necromancers controlling undead armies. Alter the land with large quarries or deforestation and you risk awakening the spiders and wurms that live deep underground. Or perhaps thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your intent, to collect their scales and silk to craft powerful armor and bows?\n\n============================================\nInstructions:                              =\n============================================\n\n* Install                                         ^_^\n* Play\n\n============================================\nScreenshots:                               =\n============================================\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://picbug.ru/share-8F6D_524D6C1D.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://picbug.ru/share-8F6D_524D6C1D.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://picbug.ru/share-DC45_524D6C1D.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://picbug.ru/share-DC45_524D6C1D.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://picbug.ru/share-005C_524D6C1D.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://picbug.ru/share-005C_524D6C1D.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://picbug.ru/share-39D9_524D6C1D.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://picbug.ru/share-39D9_524D6C1D.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://picbug.ru/share-35D3_524D6C1D.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://picbug.ru/share-35D3_524D6C1D.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://picbug.ru/share-3E59_524D6C1D.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://picbug.ru/share-3E59_524D6C1D.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nv1.4 changes:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Settler Inventory. Each settler now carries their own items separate from the global inventory counts. They work from and gather into this inventory.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Storage Structures. There are 10 new structures used by your settlers to access (and stockpile into) your global inventory. These structures also add to your storage capacities, a total of your available resource mass divided into nine categories. Nine of these structures are craftable, the last is a large wagon and is provided when starting a new game. The UI tooltips have changed to add descriptions for all structures.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ When idle, settlers will equip their own tools and weapons. Some of their preferences can be influenced ( Infantry preferring polearms, or Foragers using bow &amp; arrow ). This is done by clicking on the weapon slots. Spare inventory can also be assigned, to provide spare tools or for allowing quick profession changes without requiring a trip back to storage.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Resource Mass. Every resource now has a mass that gets used to determine a settlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s carrying encumbrance and in storage structure capacities.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A settlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s encumbrance affects their walk speed. How much they carry before stockpiling can be adjusted via a slider in their inventory menus. The base walk speed is substantially faster than in previous versions.\n\nand more ....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4c059f5913cba6096f0f54ddde20dceb4349d9b","amp;dn":"Timber+and+Stone+v1.4+%282013%29+PC+%5BENG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4c059f5913cba6096f0f54ddde20dceb4349d9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,192,89,245,145,60,186,96,150,240,245,77,221,226,13,206,180,52,157,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
