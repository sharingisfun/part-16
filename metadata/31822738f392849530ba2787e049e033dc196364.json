She is not the one to knit a woollen scarf while the kitten cuddles on her feet.\n\nThis old woman is dirty, releasing a rotting smell. You can?t define the gaze on her face, because it?s absent, you can?t stand the timbre of her voice because it?s piercing your brain with the strength of a thousand needles. Her guise is freezing cold, makes you wonder if she belongs to your World. What kind of stories would such a creature chronicle? Not the kind that work as a lullaby?\n\nThe more repulsive her aura, the more you become bewitched. What is that she is knitting with her nails? Would you dare to try it on?\n\n\nDirty Granny Tales is an acoustic/experimental group, combining puppet theatre acts with music.The compositions are dark, full of gothic lyrics and atmospheric melodies, reminding strongly The Tiger Lillies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31822738f392849530ba2787e049e033dc196364","amp;dn":"DIRTY+GRANNY+TALES+-+Inversed+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31822738f392849530ba2787e049e033dc196364","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,130,39,56,243,146,132,149,48,186,39,135,224,73,224,51,220,25,99,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
