The first tape chronicled Nine Inch Nails&amp;#039; infamous mid-90&amp;#039;s Self Destruct tour with backstage footage and raw live performances, while the second tape compiled NIN&amp;#039;s music videos from 1989 to 1997.\n\nIn 2004, a long-anticipated DVD release was finally announced, only to be delayed indefinitely due to legal hang-ups and record company red tape.  Now, with no official release in sight, the prototype version of the 2004 DVD has surfaced.\n\nThis prototype has not been professionally authored, encoded, or color-corrected, and the main feature has not been digitally remastered.  As such, video quality is not as high as it will be if Closure ever sees an official commercial release.  In the meantime, it&amp;#039;s better than nothing.\n\nTWO VERSIONS of this release will be available, depending on how you intend to view it.  They are:\n\nDual-layer disc version (for computer playback or burning with a dual-layer DVD burner):\nCLOSURE_DISC1_DL.img\nCLOSURE_DISC2_DL.img\n\nSingle-layer disc version (for burning with a single-layer DVD burner):\nCLOSURE_DISC1_SL.img\nCLOSURE_DISC2_SL.img\nCLOSURE_DISC3_SL.img\n\nThe content of both versions is the same, but the single-layer version is spread out over three discs due to space constraints.  The dual-layer version has slightly higher image quality.\n\nEach disc is distributed as a .img disc image file (basically the same as an iso file).  They can be opened from your computer and played back like a physical DVD.  They can also be burned as DVDs with programs like Toast (Mac) or Nero (PC).\n\n__________________________________________________\n\n\nClosure Disc 1:\n\nSelf Destruct:\n\n\t[introduction]\nterrible lie\n\t[preparation]\npiggy\ndown in it\n\t[complication]\nmarch of the pigs\n\t[peregrination]\n\t[exhibition]\nthe only time\n\t[chaos\n\t[congregation]\nwish\n\t[miscellany]\nhurt (with david bowie)\n\t[diversion]\nsomething i can never have\n\t[conclusion]\n\t[credits]\n\nDVD Extras:\n\nappendage (newly discovered footage, 1989-1997)\nstills gallery\n\n__________________________________________________\n\n\nClosure Disc 2:\n\nMusic Videos:\n\nhead like a hole\nsin\ndown in it\npinion\nwish\nhelp me i am in hell\nhappiness in slavery\ngave up\nmarch of the pigs\neraser (live)\nhurt (live)\nwish (live)\ncloser\nthe perfect drug\n\nDVD Extras:\n\ncloser (behind the scenes footage with commentary by mark romanek)\n\n__________________________________________________\n\n[note: on the single layer version, disc three contains the DVD extras from discs one and two]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01087852821aef1180d43b6b1e90e5bd4a7af3d6","amp;dn":"Nine+Inch+Nails%3A+%5C%22Closure%5C%22+DVD+disc+2+%28dual-layer+disc+ima","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01087852821aef1180d43b6b1e90e5bd4a7af3d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,8,120,82,130,26,239,17,128,212,59,107,30,144,229,189,74,122,243,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
