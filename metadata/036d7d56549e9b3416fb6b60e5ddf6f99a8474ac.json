Sweat\n\nTechnical review by Marcus Baker\n\nYou have probably heard a lot about Design Patterns---a technique that helps you design rock-solid solutions to practical problems that programmers everywhere encounter in their day-to-day work.\n\nEven though there has been a lot of buzz, however, no-one has yet come up with a comprehensive resource on design patterns for PHP developers---until today.\n\nAuthor Jason E. Sweat&amp;#039;s book php|architect&amp;#039;s Guide to PHP Design Patterns is the first, comprehensive guide to design patterns designed specifically for the PHP developer. This book includes coverage of 16 design patterns with a specific eye to their applications in PHP when building complex web applications, both in PHP 4 and PHP 5 (where appropriate, sample code for both versions of the language is provided).\n\nAs you can expect from a php|architect book, this Guide is very focused on its topic, with none of the fluff that accompanies the large, expensive &quot;500-page monsters&quot; you sometimes find at the bookstore. Naturally, this doesn&amp;#039;t come at the expense of depth of coverage or clarity: the book contains tens of scripts that give you a practical overview of every topic covered, from top to bottom.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n   0.
