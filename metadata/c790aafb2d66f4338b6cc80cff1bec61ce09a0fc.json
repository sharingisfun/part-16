In 1962, DeJohnette, Roscoe Mitchell and Henry Threadgill were all classmates at Wilson Junior College on Chicagoâ€™s Southside, pooling energies and enthusiasms in jam sessions. \r\n\r\nShortly thereafter Jack joined Muhal Richard Abramsâ€™ Experimental Band, and Roscoe and Henry soon followed him. When Abrams cofounded the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians in 1965, DeJohnette, Mitchell and Threadgill were all deeply involved, presenting concerts and contributing to each otherâ€™s work under the AACM umbrella.\r\n\r\nJack brought them together again for a very special concert at Chicagoâ€™s Millennium Park in August 2013, completing the group with the addition of bassist/cellist Larry Gray. The concert recording â€“ featuring compositions by Roscoe, Henry, Muhal and Jack, plus group improvising - was mixed by Manfred Eicher and Jack DeJohnette at New Yorkâ€™s Avatar Studio. Made In Chicago is issued as the AACM begins its 50th anniversary year.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - Chant\r\n02 - Jack 5\r\n03 - This\r\n04 - Museum of Time\r\n05 - Leave Don't Go Away\r\n06 - Announcement\r\n07 - Ten Minutes\r\n\r\n*2015 ECM Records | ECM 2392\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nHenry Threadgill - alto saxophone, bass flute, bass recorder\r\nRoscoe Mitchell - soprano and alto saxophones, wooden flute\r\nMuhal Richard Abrams - piano\r\nLarry Gray - double bass, violoncello\r\nJack DeJohnette - drums\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c790aafb2d66f4338b6cc80cff1bec61ce09a0fc","amp;dn":"Jack+DeJohnette+-+Made+In+Chicago+%282015%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c790aafb2d66f4338b6cc80cff1bec61ce09a0fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,144,170,251,45,102,244,51,139,108,200,12,255,27,236,97,206,9,160,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
