Sebbe never planned to build a bomb. It just happened. Sebbe is 15 years old and lives with his mother in an apartment that is too narrow. He does his best. He never strikes back. Sebbe loves his mother because he knows nothing else. In the junkyard the dream is alive, and in the hands of Sebbe, dead objects come to life. Here he has the power to create. Here he is free - but alone. His isolation grows as his world shrinks, until one day he is completely isolated with no other than his mother. And when she falls, everything falls.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:516c7ec4fe8214d3bfb32b7b9a7d8a74ca2f6d1a","amp;dn":"Sebbe+2010+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"516c7ec4fe8214d3bfb32b7b9a7d8a74ca2f6d1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,108,126,196,254,130,20,211,191,179,43,123,154,125,138,116,202,47,109,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
