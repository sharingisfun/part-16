Made with unique access to HawkingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s private life, this is an intimate and moving journey into StephenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world, both past and present. An inspirational portrait of an iconic figure, Hawking relates his incredible personal journey from boyhood under-achiever, to PhD genius, to being diagnosed with Motor Neuron Disease and given just two years to live. Despite the constant threat of death, Hawking manages to make many remarkable scientific discoveries and rises to fame and super-stardom. Hawking Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a remarkable man, and a remarkable movie.\n\nInfo: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2830416/\nRelease Date: 20 September 2013 (USA)\nGenre: Documentary\nStars : Nathan Chapple, Martin King, Joe Lovell\nQuality: BluRay 720p\nEncoder: SHQ@Ganool\nSource: 720p BluRay x264-SONiDO\nSize: 650MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23d1e69a60d464f16ef4253f0412d9b75010d432","amp;dn":"Hawking+%282013%29+BluRay+720p+650MB+Ganool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23d1e69a60d464f16ef4253f0412d9b75010d432","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,209,230,154,96,212,100,241,110,244,37,63,4,18,217,183,80,16,212,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
