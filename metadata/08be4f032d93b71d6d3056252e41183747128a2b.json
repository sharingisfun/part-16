However, orbiting the Earth there is the European/American space station FLORIDA ARKLAB, capable of controlling the weather at any location on the planet underneath. A civil project by nature, it might be abused as an offensive weapon, since it could deliver devastation to any potential adversary simply by creating natural disasters such as storms and floods. No wonder the space station soon becomes the central point in rising political tensions between East and West, tensions which could cause a Third World War.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 704x304, 25.000 fps, 1741 Kbps, 01h34m44s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, 6 channel, 448 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, German audio, optional subtitles English and German\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttps://postimg.org/image/lyw7iykwn/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttps://postimg.org/image/ei18sayg7/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/spviup0iv/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/9m27ecnon/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/uk8dcfnjb/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08be4f032d93b71d6d3056252e41183747128a2b","amp;dn":"The+Noah%27s+Ark+Principle+%5B1984+-+Germany%5D+Roland+Emmerich+scifi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08be4f032d93b71d6d3056252e41183747128a2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,190,79,3,45,147,183,29,109,48,86,37,46,65,24,55,71,18,138,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
