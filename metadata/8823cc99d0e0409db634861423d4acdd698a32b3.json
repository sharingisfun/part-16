The setting is the most celebrated of southern California jazz spots, The Lighthouse, located in a suburb of Los Angeles The occasion was a one-day, Sunday afternoon and night stand by the Adderley group, the culmination of a month-long triumphal stay in and around L.A. (onetime stronghold of &quot;cool&quot; jazz) by this thoroughly warm and soulful band.\nJULIAN &quot;CANNONBALL&quot; ADDERLEY, alto Sax ; \nNAT ADDERLEY,cornet ; \nVICTOR FELDMAN, piano; \nSAM JONES, bass ; \nLOUIS HAYES, drums.\n\nTracklist:\n1.
