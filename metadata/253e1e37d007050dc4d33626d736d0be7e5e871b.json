The Ramones did just that; by stripping down and speeding up rock &amp; roll like a hot rod that could outrun all competition, and injecting it with a massive dose of snotty, absurdist humor, they gave the music a new lease on life, and left behind a handful of brilliant recordings that are still a solid kick to hear nearly four decades after their debut hit the streets. Punk rock first emerged from a very specific time and place, but the best of it is timeless in its joyous roar, and the first four Ramones albums absolutely live up to that description.\n\n\nRamones is one of the happiest albums ever made: fourteen songs recorded for $6200, all about the joys of cartoon stupidity (&quot;Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue&quot;), cartoon violence (&quot;Beat on the Brat&quot;), cartoon male prostitution (&quot;53rd &amp; 3rd&quot;), and gigantic cartoon riffs. &quot;Second verse, same as the first,&quot; Joey chirps like he's just discovered the secret of pop; the whole thing sounds a lot simpler than it is.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
