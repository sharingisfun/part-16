These youngsters could really play \nwith the best of em! (yes Muddy Waters jumped up and down with delight while \ncleaning the studio lavatory (Until these British Beat boys arrived these were \nhard times for American Blues artists you know) We immediately offered them an \nalbum deal as the first white blues band on our label that Mick,Keith,Brian,\nCharlie &amp; Bill were keen to signÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦but alas it was not to be.\n\nIn the end legal hassles prevented the Rolling Stones from signing up to Chess \nRecords. They had to fulfil their contract with their then manager Andrew Oldham \nand their label Decca,who wereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢nt prepared to let them go and then had to return \ntotheir native England.As we all know they made the best of the situation,penned \ntheir own songs and became one if not the best Rock bands in the world.\n\nThe band came back to our studios on two more occasions (8 November 1964 and 10 May 1965) to cut more material including an early version of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSatisfactionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nWe kindly gave permission for some of these songs to appear on a few of their Decca /London albums and singles but in were in turn never allowed to issue the complete Chess studio sessions ourselves.
