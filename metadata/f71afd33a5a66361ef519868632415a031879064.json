No matter where you go they know where you are. Big Brother watches everything you do.\n \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA Surveillance State:\nSenator Wyden Warns The U.S. Could Become A Surveillance State With Govt Monitoring Your Every Move!\nPrivacy advocates have long warned that allowing the government to collect and store unlimited &quot;metadata&quot; is a highly invasive form of surveillance of citizens' communications activities. Those records enable the government to know the identity of every person with whom an individual communicates electronically, how long they spoke, and their location at the time of the communication.\n\nSuch metadata is what the US government has long attempted to obtain in order to discover an individual's network of associations and communication patterns. The request for the bulk collection of all Verizon domestic telephone records indicates that the agency is continuing some version of the data-mining program begun by the Bush administration in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attack.\n\nThe NSA, as part of a program secretly authorized by President Bush on 4 October 2001, implemented a bulk collection program of domestic telephone, internet and email records. A furore erupted in 2006 when USA Today reported that the NSA had &quot;been secretly collecting the phone call records of tens of millions of Americans, using data provided by AT&amp;T, Verizon and BellSouth&quot; and was &quot;using the data to analyze calling patterns in an effort to detect terrorist activity.&quot; Until now, there has been no indication that the Obama administration implemented a similar program.\n\nThese recent events reflect how profoundly the NSA's mission has transformed from an agency exclusively devoted to foreign intelligence gathering, into one that focuses increasingly on domestic communications. A 30-year employee of the NSA, William Binney, resigned from the agency shortly after 9/11 in protest at the agency's focus on domestic activities. The Obama administration has expanded the NSA's ease-dropping and privacy invasion to a much larger scale than previously outlined under the Bush Amdinistration. &quot;The increasing advanced technology could be leading Americans into a Surveillance State that cannot be reversed!&quot;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n10 Rules for Dealing with Police:\nThe 40-minute docudrama is the most sophisticated and entertaining film of its kind. Narrated by the legendary trial lawyer William Ã¢â‚¬Å“BillyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Murphy, Jr. (from HBOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Wire), 10 Rules depicts innocent people dealing with heavy-handed policing tactics used every day in the United States.\n\nThrough extensive collaboration with victims of police abuse, legal experts and law enforcement professionals, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve developed a powerful multi-language (English, Spanish &amp; Arabic) resource that provides proven survival strategies for dealing with racial profiling and police abuse.\n\nDo you know what your rights are if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re stopped by police? Most people donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, and the consequences can be severe. From simple misunderstandings to illegal searches and excessive force, a bad police encounter can happen to anyone. But after watching 10 Rules for Dealing with Police, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be more confident and better prepared to handle every kind of police situation.

This controversial feature length film by Emmy award-winning director David Earnhardt examines in factual, logical, and yet startling terms how easy it is to change election outcomes and undermine election integrity across the U.S. Noted computer programmers, statisticians, journalists, and experienced election officials provide the irrefutable proof.\n\nUNCOUNTED shares well documented stories about the spine-chilling disregard for the right to vote in America. In Florida, computer programmer Clint Curtis is directed by his boss to create software that will &quot;flip&quot; votes from one candidate to another. In Utah, County Clerk Bruce Funk is locked out of his office for raising questions about security flaws in electronic voting machines. Californian Steve Heller gets convicted of a felony after he leaks secret documents detailing illegal activities committed by a major voting machine company. And Tennessee entrepreneur, Athan Gibbs, finds verifiable voting a hard sell in America and dies before his dream of honest elections can be realized.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.uncountedthemovie.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.uncountedthemovie.com&lt;/a&gt;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe AP Spying Story - What You Arent Being Told:\nIn recent weeks we have been told to focus on a series of scandals which, we are told, are rocking the Obama Administration. Has the media finally found outrage over the Obama regimeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s use of drone strikes to kill scores of innocent women and children in countries that are not even at war with the United States? Or the DOJÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recent admission that the strikes had indeed killed American citizens? Or John KerryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recent attempts to once again lead the American public into supporting military intervention in the Middle East based on provably false claims of WMD?\n\nOf course not. No, the mediaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sudden discovery of outrage is directed at an entirely different scandal: the fact that reporters have now allegedly found themselves in the governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crosshairs.\n\nTo add fuel to the fire of this current controversy, it has recently been revealed that Fox News reporter James Rosen has been under investigation by the Justice Department as a possible co-conspirator in a case involving leaked State Department information on North Korean nuclear tests. Particularly galling is the fact that Attorney General Eric Holder personally signed off on the investigation and is now being charged with leading the investigation into the investigation....\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDont Talk to Cops_ Part 1:\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the TRUTH.
