His first recipe is delicate cep      \n    mushroom tortellini made using fresh pasta. He follows   \n    this up with a French version of a pasty called           \n    pithivier, filled with a rich mix of pheasant,             \n    chestnuts and dried fruits. Next is the simplest          \n    fricassee of wild mushrooms with herbs and croutons      \n    cooked in the company of restaurant maintenance manager   \n    Steve Truman. For the finale, a salt crust baked pigeon    \n    uncovers a technique perfect for cooking game and         \n    poultry. Along the way, Raymond and Steve join a shoot   \n    in Perthshire and go mushroom hunting in the Scottish     \n    woodlands.                                                 \n                                                              \n                                                                \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:181ee031f265e6d89a24105742168ac8c5ca3bc0","amp;dn":"Raymond.Blancs.Kitchen.Secrets.S01E05.720p.HDTV.x264-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"181ee031f265e6d89a24105742168ac8c5ca3bc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,30,224,49,242,101,230,216,154,36,16,87,66,22,138,200,197,202,59,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
