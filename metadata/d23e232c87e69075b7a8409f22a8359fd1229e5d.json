However, since the second world war is happening around them business is not what it could be and after a customer who owes them a large sum fails to pay they are forced against their better judgement to violate their preferred neutrality and to take a job for the resistance transporting a fugitive on the run from the Nazis to Martinique. Through all this runs the stormy relationship between Morgan and Marie &quot;Slim&quot; Browning, a resistance sympathizer and the sassy singer in the club where Morgan spends most of his days.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d23e232c87e69075b7a8409f22a8359fd1229e5d","amp;dn":"To+Have+And+Have+Not+%5B1944%5D+Eng+and+Swesub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d23e232c87e69075b7a8409f22a8359fd1229e5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,62,35,44,135,230,144,117,183,168,64,159,34,168,53,159,209,34,158,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
