Lunchtime doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to be about hurrying through an assortment of processed products. The midday meal is a fabulous opportunity to enjoy delicious ingredients and flavor-packed dishes and to slow down while you eat (even if just for a few moments). Acclaimed chef Gale Gand shows you how to make it happenÃ¢â‚¬â€simply and easily, and for a fraction of the price of prepared salads and sandwiches. Gand offers 150 recipesÃ¢â‚¬â€including plenty of kid-friendly fare (tested and approved by GandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own children)Ã¢â‚¬â€along with tons of tips for packing foods to go or turning lunch into a celebration with friends and family. As Gand says, when it comes to entertaining, Ã¢â‚¬Å“lunch is the new dinner.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Chapters on soups, pastas, salads, grains, fruits, and more, as well as desserts, drinks, dips, and snacks, provide countless combinations for memorable meals at home or on the go.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s4.postimg.org/upu3qlz5p/gale.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s4.postimg.org/upu3qlz5p/gale.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.galegand.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.galegand.com/&lt;/a&gt;\nChef Gale Gand is a nationally acclaimed pastry chef, restaurateur, cookbook author, television personality, teacher, entrepreneur, and mother.
