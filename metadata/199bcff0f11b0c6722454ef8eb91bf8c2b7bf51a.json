Burke obtained a BSc (joint honours in Chemistry &amp; Biology, 1988) from NUI-Maynooth and a PhD from University College Dublin, Ireland (1993, under the supervision of W. Ivo O?Sullivan, in the group of Prof. DMX Donnelly). After post-doctoral studies with Steve Davies (Oxford, 1993-96) and Chris Maycock (ITQB ?Portugal, 1996-1999) he obtained a position as assistant professor in organic chemistry, at the University of Evora, Portugal. His interests lie mainly in the areas of asymmetric synthesis and catalysis, reaction mechanisms and medicinal chemistry. In 2012 he obtained his aggregation in organic chemistry from the University of Ãƒâ€°vora. He is a former vice-president of the organic chemistry division of the Portuguese Chemical Society, and has journal editorial experience. Professor Burke has authored over 60 publications, including a book chapter, papers and patents. He founded Chiratecnics Lda ? a chiral technology specialist house in 2009.\n\nCarolina S. Marques was born in Alcoba?a (Portugal) in 1981. She finished her first degree in chemistry at the University of Ãƒâ€°vora, Portugal in 2005 and obtained a masters? degree in Applied Chemistry at the same institution in 2007. In 2008 she won a scholarship to work with Prof. Carlos Afonso at Instituto Superior TÃƒÂ©cnico, Portugal. In 2009 she returned to Ãƒâ€°vora, after winning a national PhD scholarship to do research in the field of asymmetric catalysis under the supervision of Prof. Burke, which she defended successfully in 2013. Dr Marques is currently developing new catalytic methods using metal based catalysts for the synthesis of small-molecules for neurodegenerative diseases. She was the recipient of the prize of best PhD in organic chemistry by the SPQ in 2013 and has authored 25 publications, including patents","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:199bcff0f11b0c6722454ef8eb91bf8c2b7bf51a","amp;dn":"Catalytic+Arylation+%3A+Methods+From+the+Academic+Lab+to+Industria","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"199bcff0f11b0c6722454ef8eb91bf8c2b7bf51a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,155,207,240,241,27,12,103,34,69,78,248,235,145,191,140,43,123,245,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
