It includes original contributions on the synthesis of suitable organic materials, fabrication of organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) and organic white light emitting devices (WOLEDs), characterization of these devices and some designs for optimal performance.\n\nAll chapters are self-sufficient in presenting their contents.\nThe cost effective chemical technology offers many exciting possibilities for OLEDs and organic solar cells (OSCs) to be futuristic solutions for lighting and power generation.\nA common flexible substrate can be used to fabricate OLEDs on one side facing a room and OSCs on the other side facing the sun. The device thus fabricated can generate power in the day time and light a room/house at night.\nThe book covers developments on OLEDs, WOLEDs and briefly on OSCs as well.\n\nContents\nPreface\n1 Harvesting Emission in White Organic Light Emitting Devices\n2 Field Emission Organic Light Emitting Diode\n3 Polarized Light-Emission from Photonic Organic Light-Emitting Devices\n4 Effect of Photonic Structures in Organic Light-Emitting Diodes - Light Extraction and Polarization Characteristics\n5 Photophysical Properties of Two New Donor-Acceptor Conjugated Copolymers and Their Model Compounds: Applications in Polymer Light Emitting Diodes (PLEDs) and Polymer Photovoltaic Cells (PPCs)\n6 The Advanced Charge Injection Techniques Towards the Fabrication of High-Power Organic Light Emitting Diodes\n7 Exciplex Electroluminescence of the New Organic Materials for Light-Emitting Diodes\n8 Synthesis and Physical Properties of Red Luminescent Glass Forming Pyranylidene and Isophorene Fragment Containing Derivatives","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d1384f777698ef65c43e1e87486bb8be77bdff3","amp;dn":"Organic+Light+Emitting+Devices","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d1384f777698ef65c43e1e87486bb8be77bdff3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,19,132,247,119,105,142,246,92,67,225,232,116,134,187,139,231,123,223,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
