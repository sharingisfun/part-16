It introduces fundamentals of programming, problem-solving, object-oriented programming, and GUI programming. The Brief version is suitable for a CS1 course.\n\nRegardless of major, students will be able to grasp concepts of problem-solving and programming ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ thanks to LiangÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fundamentals-first approach, students learn critical problem solving skills and core constructs before object-oriented programming.  LiangÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s approach includes application-rich programming examples, which go beyond the traditional math-based problems found in most texts. Students are introduced to topics like control statements, methods, and arrays before learning to create classes. Later chapters introduce advanced topics including graphical user interface, exception handling, I/O, and data structures. Small, simple examples demonstrate concepts and techniques while longer examples are presented in case studies with overall discussions and thorough line-by-line explanations. In the Eighth Edition, only standard classes are used.\n\n\n# Paperback: 744 pages\n# Publisher: Prentice Hall; 8 edition (January 13, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0132130793\n# ISBN-13: 978-0132130790","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea2eb76221cabea6eb2ed6718c96185f941a1fa8","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Java+Programming+-Brief+Version%2C8th+Ed%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea2eb76221cabea6eb2ed6718c96185f941a1fa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,46,183,98,33,202,190,166,235,46,214,113,140,150,24,95,148,26,31,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
