Lyrically the band focus on the themes of nature, nostalgia and sorrow. Andy describes the Scottish Highlands as a major influence on his lyrics commenting that it's like &quot;another world&quot; away from the grey and dreary urban culture that they both grew up around. The other themes are influenced by personal experiences and a longing for the past.\n\nHaving a deep connection with the Scottish landscape the band is named after the Falls of Falloch waterfall in Crianlarich.\n\nThey started recording their debut album Where Distant Spirits Remain in 2010. Upon completion they managed to secure legendary producer Ronan Chris Murphy (Ulver, King Crimson etc.) to master the album in early 2011, with the chance to sign to the revered Candlelight Records following shortly after. Their album was released on 26th September to a great critical reception.\n\n\n\nBand Members\n\nScott McLean  - Keyboards, Guitars\nBen Brown - Bass\nSteve Scott - Drums\nTony Dunn - Vocals, Guitars\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nWhere Distant Spirits Remain (2011)\nThis Island, Our Funeral (2014)\n\n\n\nThis Island, Our Funeral (2014)\n\n\n\n01.
