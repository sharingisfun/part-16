Looking to the past while investigating the present, the mathematician-turned-filmmaker condenses three distinct Californian landscapes into a total of 105 shots, each exactly 2Ã‚Â½ minutes long. Formal restraint and compositional precision combine with ambient sound and an unheard social commentary to create a hypnotic journey across the 31st US State; from the Great Central Valley (El Valley Centro) through greater Los Angeles (Los) to the Californian wilderness (Sogobi). This 2-disc set presents the complete California Trilogy for the first time ever on DVD.\n\n=== Screens === \n\n===========================\n\nIt certainly isn't HD quality, but it's probably the best you're going to find anywhere outside of the actual film prints. The MP4's really don't differ much from the quality that can found on the European DVD. \n\nIf you're looking to be entertained, these aren't the films for you. The trilogy is purely a quiet contemplation of American landscapes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:004a413a3ccb40583436730fcd4e6be6be548742","amp;dn":"James+Benning+-+California+Trilogy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"004a413a3ccb40583436730fcd4e6be6be548742","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,74,65,58,60,203,64,88,52,54,115,15,205,78,107,230,190,84,135,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
