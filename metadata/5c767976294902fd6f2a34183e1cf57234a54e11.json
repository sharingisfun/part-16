The core members are vocalist Carla Torgerson and vocalist and songwriter Chris Eckman. Although the rest of the line-up has changed occasionally, for most of the time the other members have been Michael Wells, Glenn Slater and Terri Moeller.\n\nThe band draws inspiration from folk and country music, particularly Townes Van Zandt, Neil Young and Johnny Cash, but also from other types of artists and musical styles such as Scott Walker, Leonard Cohen, French chanson and Jacques Brel. Their sound is typically rich, with string arrangements and keyboards in addition to the standard rock instruments. In reviews the band&amp;#039;s music is often described as melancholic or mellow, while Eckman&amp;#039;s lyrics, concerning such themes as human relations, loneliness and restlessness, are often emphasized as poetic.\n\n1988 \tSee Beautiful Rattlesnake Gardens \n1990 \tRag &amp; Bone\n1991 \tScavenger\t\n1993 \tNew West Motel\t\n1993 \tSatisfied Mind\t\n1994 \tSetting the Woods on Fire\n1996 \tDevil&amp;#039;s Road\t\n1996 \tDeath Valley Days: Lost Songs and Rarities, 1985-1995\n1997 \tNighttown\t\n1999 \tTrail of Stars\t\n2000 \tTrain Leaves At Eight\n2001 \tEnded Up A Stranger\n2002    Drunken Soundtracks\n2002    I&amp;#039;m Sorry\n2003    Emona - Live In Ljubljana,26-01-2002\n2003 \tSlow Days With Nina\n2005    Acetylene\n2005    No You Won&amp;#039;t\n\nExtra\nChris &amp; Carla  [1993-2003]\nSolo           [200-2004] ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c767976294902fd6f2a34183e1cf57234a54e11","amp;dn":"The+Walkabouts+%5B1988-2005%5D+%2B+extra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c767976294902fd6f2a34183e1cf57234a54e11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,118,121,118,41,73,2,253,111,42,52,24,62,28,245,114,52,165,78,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
