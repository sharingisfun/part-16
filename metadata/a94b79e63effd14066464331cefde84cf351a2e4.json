But he is about to face his deadliest challenge yet.\nThe most wanted man in the world, American al Qaeda commander Daoud al Amriki, and his handpicked team of terrorist operatives, have acquired stores of Russian-built, shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles (SAM's) from ex-Libyan spies in Cairo. Their mission: infiltrate the United States and take down American aircraft. The country's best are tasked with stopping them. But when a SEAL Team Six mission to take down al Amriki goes wrong, Major Raynor and his Delta Force team find themselves front and center as Amriki and his terrorists work their way closer to America. And time is running out.\n\nDramatic and revealing, Tier One Wild takes listeners on an international thrill ride from the black ops nerve center of JSOC to the bloody streets of Cairo in a story only a former Delta Force commander could tell. \n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                          Published - October 16th 2012 \n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a94b79e63effd14066464331cefde84cf351a2e4","amp;dn":"Tier+One+Wild+by+Dalton+Fury+%28Delta+Force+02%29+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a94b79e63effd14066464331cefde84cf351a2e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,75,121,230,62,255,209,64,102,70,67,49,206,253,232,76,243,81,162,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
