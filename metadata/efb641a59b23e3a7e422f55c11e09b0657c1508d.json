All work done by VIruz.\n\n----\n\nSummary:\nPistons have been added in Space Engineers - they can be used to build advanced machinery. Also, faction founders and leaders can now enable auto-approval for new members. Players will now be able to see a notification on HUD when somebody is hacking/grinding their ship (does not apply to armors). Thrusters can be used without cockpit - through the terminal - which enables the option to create missiles with warheads, turret countermeasures, small drones which grind enemy ships by using grinder and other. Blast door blocks has been also added in the game; it's similar to armor, but thinner, so it can slide between two layers of armor (very useful for airtight door and hangar bays).\n\n\nFeatures:\n- pistons\n- factions: enabled/disabled member auto-approval \n- hacking/breach HUD notification\n- thrusters can work without cockpit - through terminal\n- blast door blocks (4 types, durability will be balanced in the next updates)\n- rotor height adjustment\n- semi-auto mode for battery\n\nFixes:\n- fixed issue when player could not leave respawn screen\n- fixed large antenna texture bug\n- fixed steering wheels losing sync \n- fixed lags with batteries turned to charging mode\n- fixed few instances of death-loop\n- fixed multiplayer filter issues\n- fixed visible aiming rectangle when turret is of after loading new world\n- fixed issue when placing a new landing gear/station block without resources in survival mode was fully built\n- fixed missing permanent death configuration when starting DS\n- fixed issue with block preview when in 3rd person view\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efb641a59b23e3a7e422f55c11e09b0657c1508d","amp;dn":"Space+Engineers+v01.040.009+by+VIruz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efb641a59b23e3a7e422f55c11e09b0657c1508d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,182,65,165,155,35,227,167,228,34,245,92,17,224,155,6,87,193,80,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
