In fact, two of their instruments are actually NES controllers, which can do wonders onstage and in their songs. \n\nThe album on here, &quot;Cool is Just a Number - EP&quot; has five songs, including &quot;Heads Up, Hearts Down&quot; and &quot;The Faster the Treadmill...&quot;\n\nThe zip folder has both Windows and MacOSX versions. Go into the zip folder, and copy and paste the songs or whatever else is in there to whereever you want.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ad5a4abc983ba1f3d9bca87533000c88d9c8087","amp;dn":"I+Fight+Dragons+-+Cool+is+Just+a+Number+-+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ad5a4abc983ba1f3d9bca87533000c88d9c8087","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,213,164,171,201,131,186,31,61,155,202,135,83,48,0,200,141,156,128,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
