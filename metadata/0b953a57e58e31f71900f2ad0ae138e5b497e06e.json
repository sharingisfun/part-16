The role of the dermatologist in this context is to suspect the presence of a hidden ED based on these guiding signs. With this in mind, the most important specialists in the field come together in this book to document all of the dermatological aspects of EDs. General topics such as classification of EDs, epidemiology, and medical complications are first addressed, and skin signs attributable to various causes are then discussed in a series of detailed chapters. Characteristic changes in the hair, nails, and oral cavity are also carefully documented, and the closing chapters address various other related issues of interest. &quot;Eating Disorders and the Skin&quot; will be an invaluable source of up-to-date information for both novice and experienced dermatologists, as well as other practitioners, psychiatrists, and nurses.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b953a57e58e31f71900f2ad0ae138e5b497e06e","amp;dn":"Eating+Disorders+and+the+Skin+-+Renata+Strumia+-+Pdf+-+Yeal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b953a57e58e31f71900f2ad0ae138e5b497e06e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,149,58,87,229,142,49,247,25,0,242,173,10,225,56,229,180,151,224,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
