Are we alone in the Universe? Using clear and plain language, the author explores these two interesting scientific-philosophical themes with a broad range of studies, including astronomy, cosmology, chemistry, biology, geology and planet science.\r\nThe first part discusses the origins of everything, from the Big Bang to humankind. It follows the long course of evolution -- from original matter to the formation of more complex structures, from the furthest galaxies to the nearest stars, from planets to organic molecules, from the first and most elementary forms of life through to the reptiles, the dinosaurs and the advent of man.\r\n\r\nThe second part traces the history of the Earth and evaluates the risks of extinction in the future as predicted by scientists. Is the Earth the only habitable planet in the Universe? This question initiates the discussion on the importance of the Earth's position in the solar system and the significance of our geologically alive planet.\r\n\r\nThe final part is dedicated to the search for extraterrestrial beings with identifiable life forms. It also describes attempts for searching, from the past to the near future.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable book provides the best answers we have to the epic questions about us and our place in the universe.\r\n\r\nReadership: General audience interested in general science","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29073d841d85aa97d927eea73fd5b5fd86ebcf1f","amp;dn":"Beyond+the+Stars+%282012%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29073d841d85aa97d927eea73fd5b5fd86ebcf1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,7,61,132,29,133,170,151,217,39,238,167,63,213,181,253,134,235,207,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
