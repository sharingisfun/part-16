The opening Bach prelude is as fast as you'll hear on guitar, while the rest of the suite is played with distinct flair. \n\nSpecial mention should be given to the pieces composed by Sulek &amp; played with deep feeling &amp; fine phrasing. Moreover, Ana Vidovic's playing of the Walton Bagtelles is a revelation &amp; should establish her in the guitar world. \n\nHer guitar tone is appealing, neither overly bright nor too bass laden. The recording is high quality. A must for all classical guitar fans.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1259d2ef24caaabe6b0003cc5db53e7c19cb9490","amp;dn":"Ana+Vidovic+-+Classical+Guitar+Recital+%281998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1259d2ef24caaabe6b0003cc5db53e7c19cb9490","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,89,210,239,36,202,170,190,107,0,3,204,93,181,62,124,25,203,148,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
