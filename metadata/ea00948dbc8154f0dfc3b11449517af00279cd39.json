Hewakandamby (Ventus, 2012).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-87-403-0069-7\r\n\r\nWhen students start an undergraduate course in engineering, they experience a step change in the level of complexity of the materials that had to be learned. Fluid Mechanics is one such module taught in the first year of the engineering undergraduate courses. It is a core module for Chemical, Mechanical and Civil engineers. The concepts may seem difficult and hard to grasp at the first instance but as the knowledge broadens, one may find it fascinating. This book is a collection of lecture notes developed from a series of lectures delivered to first year Chemical Engineers.\r\nThe target readership is the first year engineering undergraduates but it could be used by anybody who wants to find the joy in learning fluid mechanics.\r\nSome of the figures in this document are taken from the World Wide Web","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea00948dbc8154f0dfc3b11449517af00279cd39","amp;dn":"A+First+Course+in+Fluid+Mechanics+for+Engineers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea00948dbc8154f0dfc3b11449517af00279cd39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,0,148,141,188,129,84,240,223,195,177,20,73,81,122,240,2,121,205,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
