A mechanism intended to access past and future, the tunnel is not quite ready despite a decade of work and all the billions. Senator Clark declares his intention to cut funding and abandon the project. Desparate scientist Tony Newman uses the apparatus to send himself through time to prove the concept. But the TicToc team cannot retrieve him, and so his mentor Doug Phillips goes back to help Tony out of the peril he has landed in: he has arrived on the RMS Titanic mere days before she struck an iceberg and sank!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5161e33a2e9fbb43e63af46a3a522cbd01de592","amp;dn":"The+Time+Tunnel+-+Rendezvous+With+Yesterday+Ep.+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5161e33a2e9fbb43e63af46a3a522cbd01de592","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,22,30,51,162,233,251,180,62,99,175,70,163,165,34,203,208,29,229,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
