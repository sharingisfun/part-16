Austin has superhuman strength due to bionic implants and is employed as a secret agent by a fictional U.S. government office titled OSI. The series was based on the Martin Caidin novel Cyborg, which was the working title of the series during pre-production.\r\n\r\nFollowing three television pilot movies, which all aired in 1973, The Six Million Dollar Man television series aired on the ABC network as a regular episodic series for five seasons from 1974 to 1978. Steve Austin became a pop culture icon of the 1970s. A spin-off television series, The Bionic Woman, featuring the lead female character Jaime Sommers, ran from 1976 to 1978 (and was the subject of a remake in 2007). Three television movies featuring both bionic characters were also produced from 1987 to 1994","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e601e68ee5f7a74fb3387a3b09f7876433be5ef","amp;dn":"The+Six+Million+Dollar+Man+-+Season+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e601e68ee5f7a74fb3387a3b09f7876433be5ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,96,30,104,238,95,122,116,251,51,135,163,176,159,120,118,67,59,229,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
