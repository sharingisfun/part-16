Hendrik Hofgen (Klaus Maria Brandauer, offering an electric performance) is the star of a state-funded theater department who tires of his job. Like his friends, he pays lip service to socialist ideals fashionable for artists of his time -- that is, until the Nazis rise to power. He then sees an opportunity to achieve his objective of fame: he will perform propaganda plays and thereby use the Nazis as a vehicle to spread his name across the country -- only too late does he realize his mistake. This well-adapted version of the book featured the first teaming of Brandauer with director Istvan Szabo; they would later reunite to make Colonel Redl and Hanussen. Brandauer first gained attention in the U.S. after the film's release and would be cast as the villain in Never Say Never Again as a result.\n\n\nSUBS\n\nENG,PORT,SPAN\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082736/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082736/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mephisto_%281981_film%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mephisto_%281981_film%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-82736/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-82736/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 464x256\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 551 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,20 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 124 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:824a506cce4af574d8acba9f47a780f4ceb4af6d","amp;dn":"Mephisto+%281981%29+Ger%2Cmultisubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"824a506cce4af574d8acba9f47a780f4ceb4af6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,74,80,108,206,74,245,116,216,172,186,159,71,167,128,244,206,180,175,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
