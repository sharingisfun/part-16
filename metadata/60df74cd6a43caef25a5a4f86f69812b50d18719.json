This is a real challenge for electric systems and a paradigm shift for existing distribution networks. With the help of Ã¢â‚¬Å“advancedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ smart technologies, the Distribution System Operators will have a central role to integrate massively renewable generation, electric vehicle and demand response programs. Many projects are on-going to develop and assess advanced smart grids solutions, with already some lessons learnt. In the end, the Smart Grid is a mean for Distribution System Operators to ensure the quality and the security of power supply.\n\nSeveral books have been written to provide a definition of Smart grids, explore the different technical evolution needed and explain / analyse what would be the benefits. All those books are conducted on theoretical basis by academics and strategy consultants. This new book will propose a complementary and singular approach based on a practical experience from DSOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s.\n\nPublisher: Wiley-ISTE; 1 edition (December 31, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1848217374\nISBN-13: 978-1848217379","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60df74cd6a43caef25a5a4f86f69812b50d18719","amp;dn":"Advanced+Smartgrids+for+Distribution+System+Operators%28pdf%29%7BZzzzz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60df74cd6a43caef25a5a4f86f69812b50d18719","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,223,116,205,106,67,202,239,37,165,164,248,111,105,129,43,80,209,135,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
