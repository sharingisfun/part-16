Life is tough as they try to keep up the appearance of being like the rest of the decomposing masses, and things heat up when a damsel in distress needs their help. Will they blow their cover for a beautiful young girl, or sacrifice her in the name of rock and roll?\n\nThree-issue series with art by Ben Stenbeck, and covers by legendary Richard Corben, making zombies fun again.\n\nTwo boys, a girl, and seven billion living dead.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17202c532c592e4d7870e66d3084da6a14ba1a63","amp;dn":"Living+With+The+Dead+%5BComplete%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17202c532c592e4d7870e66d3084da6a14ba1a63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,32,44,83,44,89,46,77,120,112,230,109,48,132,218,106,20,186,26,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
