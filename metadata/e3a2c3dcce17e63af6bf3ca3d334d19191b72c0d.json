Cookie swaps are social. Cookie swaps are hip yet old-school, trendy yet traditional. Cookie swaps are creative, inexpensive, DIY, and a great way to entertain. Cookie swaps are baking meets Stitch â€™n Bitch, with newspapers, magazines, and websitesâ€”including The New York Times, The Washington Post, Better Homes and Gardens, Real Simple, Family Fun, Southern Living, Kraft.com, and Ed Levineâ€™s Serious Eatsâ€”all writing about the trend. Cookie Swap! captures all of this and more in an idea-packed, slightly sassy guide. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, itâ€™s all about the swap: when to swap (Christmas, of course, and other holidays, but also birthdays, bridal showers, graduation parties, PTA meetings, and fund-raisersâ€”or just at your next book club meeting). And how to swapâ€”with a planner, cookie swap math guide (so everyone gets the same number of cookies), ideas for invitations, decorations, containers, and then, when the crumbs have settled, how to make a keepsake. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, itâ€™s all about the cookies. Lauren Chattman is a former professional pastry chef and baking writer whoâ€™s put together a knockout collection of more than 60 delectable, easy-to-make, simple-to-sophisticated recipes covering every kind of cookieâ€”from crowd-pleasing favorites like Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies and Pumpkin Cheesecake Brownies to unexpected treats like Flaky Cardamom Palmiers and Green Tea Sandwich Cookies with Almond Cream. Finally, the book ends with a chapter of drink recipesâ€”such as Iced Irish Coffee, Mini Strawberry Milk Shakes and Juicy Sangriaâ€”because not every cookie wants milk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3a2c3dcce17e63af6bf3ca3d334d19191b72c0d","amp;dn":"Lauren+Chattman+-+Cookie+Swap%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3a2c3dcce17e63af6bf3ca3d334d19191b72c0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,162,195,220,206,23,230,58,246,191,60,163,211,52,209,145,145,183,44,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
