Live Life Living returns to that infernally catchy template, albeit with a touch of sobriety. Instead of hedonistic celebration, opening track Next Year gloomily notes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as Chemical Brothersy synths rake the air Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that it's just a brief respite from the nine-to-five. Likewise, one of the big bangers, Kids Again, explodes into an EDM climax just as Example reflects that happiness as a 32-year-old isn't a patch on the uncomplicated joy he knew as a teenager. And the three songs dedicated to his wife Ã¢â‚¬â€œ of which One More Day is the most propulsive Ã¢â‚¬â€œ are whopping house tracks with troubled hearts: his marital bliss is tempered with sung-rapped memories of the loneliness of life before her. Not quite your average mega-bantz lad-rapper, then Ã¢â‚¬â€œ file him somewhere between raging-bull Plan B and a more thoughtful Professor Green.\n\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFile size                                : 92.4 MiB, 143 MiB\nDuration                                 : 40mn 02s, 01h 02mn 08s\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Constant\nOverall bit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nAlbum                                    : Live Life Living [Deluxe Edition] Disc 1, Disc 2\nAlbum/Performer                          : Example\nPerformer                                : Example\nEncoded by                               : Callixtus\nPublisher                                : Sony Music\nGenre                                    : Dance\nRecorded date                            : 2014\nCopyright                                : Callixtus\nCover                                    : Yes\nCover type                               : Cover (front)\nCover MIME                               : image/jpeg\nEncoder                                  : Callixtus\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nDuration                                 : 40mn 02s, 01h 02mn 08s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\n\n\n\nCD-1\n1.
