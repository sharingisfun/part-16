During the competition, the band made appearances on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and performed at the Bonnaroo Music Festival as well The Osheaga Festival in Montreal, Quebec. The band has officially signed with Atlantic Records. The band is going on tour with Kings of Leon as the opening act on the Canadian leg of the Kings of Leon tour.[2]\n\nThe band released several recordings independently prior to their Rolling Stone victory.\n\nThe band's new EP has entered at #7 on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 3,300 copies.[3]\n\nThe band was featured in season 9, episode 9 of Lifetime's Project Runway entitled &quot;Image Is Everything&quot; which aired on September 22, 2011.[4] The contestants on the show had to design clothes for the band members. Each member was fitted for two different outfits by two different designers. Then, instead of walking the runway wearing the finished product, the band played two of their songs: &quot;Who?&quot; and &quot;I Don't Know&quot; while wearing the clothes designed for them. After playing one song with one outfit, they switched outfits to play the next song. During their performance, the judges would score the garments. The outfit made for Leot Hanson by Viktor Luna was the winning design. Subsequently, that outfit was worn by Leot for Garnier advertisements in Marie Claire magazine and for the Rolling Stone &quot;Choose the Cover&quot; shoot.[5]\n\nAlso on September 22, band won the three CASBY Awards they were nominated for. They won Favourite New Artist, Favourite Indie Album, and Favourite New Album.[6] The Sheepdogs won Rock album of the year at the 2011 Western Canadian Music Awards. [7]\n\nTheir song &quot;Who?&quot; was featured in a scene of the second episode (&quot;Tell-Tale Hearts&quot;) of season 12 of the hit CBS series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation which aired on September 29, 2011.\n\nOn November 24, 2011, The Sheepdogs album Learn &amp; Burn was certified Gold in Canada. \n\n\n\n\nLearn &amp; Burn 2010\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.
