These include the engine, propeller, induction,\nignition, as well as the fuel, lubrication, cooling, electrical,\nlanding gear, and environmental control systems.\nPowerplant\nAn aircraft engine, or powerplant, produces thrust to propel\nan aircraft. Reciprocating engines and turboprop engines\nwork in combination with a propeller to produce thrust.\nTurbojet and turbofan engines produce thrust by increasing\nthe velocity of air flowing through the engine. All of these\npowerplants also drive the various systems that support the\noperation of an aircraft.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ab172243c19e12689b2497ab6db0e0f9d25239d","amp;dn":"Aircraft+Systems+by+FAA.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ab172243c19e12689b2497ab6db0e0f9d25239d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,177,114,36,60,25,225,38,137,178,73,122,182,219,14,15,157,37,35,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
