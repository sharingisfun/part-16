Due to high demand and interest from fans, the release date was pushed ahead by a full month, from its original 28 March 2011 release date.[1] Production for the album took place throughout 2010. A range of producers contributed to the album, including Dr. Luke, Toby Gad, and K-Gee, among others.  Who You Are received generally mixed reviews from contemporary music critics. It debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart selling 105,000 copies in its first week. The album debuted in the US at number 11 on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 34,000 copies. Two singles preceded the album: Jessie J's UK debut single &quot;Do It Like a Dude&quot; and &quot;Price Tag&quot;, featuring B.o.B which served as the US lead single.
