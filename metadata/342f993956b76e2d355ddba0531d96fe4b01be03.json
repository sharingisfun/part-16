They were one of the most successful bands of the 1980s and a leading band in the MTV-driven &quot;Second British Invasion&quot; of the United States. Since the 1980s, they have placed 14 singles in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart and 21 in the Billboard Hot 100 and have, according to the Sunday Mercury, sold more than 100 million records.[7] While they were generally considered part of the New Romantic scene along with bands such as Spandau Ballet when they first emerged, they later shed this image. The band worked with fashion designers to build a sharp and elegant image that earned them the nickname &quot;the prettiest boys in rock.&quot;[8] The band's controversial videos, which included partial nudity and suggestions of sexuality, became popular in the early 1980s on the then-new music video channel MTV. Duran Duran were among the first bands to have their videos shot by professional directors with 35 mm film movie cameras, which gave their videos a much more polished look. In 1984, the band were early innovators with video technology in their live stadium shows.\n\nThe group was formed by Nick Rhodes, John Taylor and Stephen Duffy, with the later addition of Roger Taylor and, after numerous personnel changes, Andy Taylor and Simon Le Bon. (None of the Taylors are related.) The group has never disbanded, but the lineup has changed to include guitarist Warren Cuccurullo from 1989 to 2000 and drummer Sterling Campbell from 1989 to 1991. The reunion of the original five members in the early 2000s created a stir among the band's fans and music media.[9][10] Andy Taylor left the band in mid-2006, and London guitarist Dom Brown has since been working with the band as a session player and touring member. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuran Duran 2010\n\n\nDuran Duran is the debut album by the English pop rock band Duran Duran, released worldwide in 1981.\n\nThe album reached #3 on the United Kingdom charts and remained in the chart for 118 weeks, eventually achieving platinum status in late 1982. The initial release was largely ignored in the United States, but the album was reissued there in 1983 following the success of the band's second album, Rio. This time it reached #10 on the US Billboard 200, and remained on that chart for 87 weeks. Duran Duran was certified platinum (a shipment of one million units) by the RIAA on 4 June 1985.\n\n\n\nTracks \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1 \n\n\nOriginal album (tracks 1-9) and b-sides (tracks 10-13):\n\n1.\tGirls On Film (3.39)\n2.\tPlanet Earth (3.57)\n3.\tAnyone Out There (4.02)\n4.\tTo The Shore (3.47)\n5.\tCareless Memories (4.08)\n6.\tNight Boat (5.25)\n7.\tSound Of Thunder (4.06)\n8.\tFriends Of Mine (5.40)\n9.\tTel Aviv (5.16)\n10.\tLate Bar (2.56)\n11.\tKhanada (3.28)\n12.\tFame (3.18)\n13.\tFaster Than Light (4.29)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisc 2 \n\n\nThe AIR Studios versions (recorded on 29 July, 1980):\n\n1.\tGirls On Film (3.57)\n2.\tTel Aviv (6.02)\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tRecorded at AIR Studios on 29 July, 1980\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tProduced by Jon Walls\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tEngineered by Jon Walls and Rick Isbell\n\nThe Manchester Square Demos (recorded on 8 December, 1980):\n\n1.\tAnyone Out There (4.09)\n2.\tPlanet Earth (5.00)\n3.\tFriends Of Mine (5.52)\n4.\tLate Bar (3.02)\n\nRadio 1 Peter Powell session (recorded 19 June, 1981 transmitted 11 August, 1981; mono):\n\n1.\tNight Boat (5.12)\n2.\tGirls On Film (3.38)\n3.\tAnyone Out There (3.54)\n4.\tLike An Angel (4.52)\n\nThe Versions:\n\n1.\tPlanet Earth (Night Version) (6.20)\n2.\tGirls On Film (Extended Night version) (5.43)\n3.\tPlanet Earth (Night mix) (6.15)\n4.\tGirls On Film (Night mix) (5.41)\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:342f993956b76e2d355ddba0531d96fe4b01be03","amp;dn":"Duran+Duran+%28Special+Edition+2+CD%29+2010+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"342f993956b76e2d355ddba0531d96fe4b01be03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,47,153,57,86,183,110,45,53,93,219,160,83,29,150,254,75,1,190,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
