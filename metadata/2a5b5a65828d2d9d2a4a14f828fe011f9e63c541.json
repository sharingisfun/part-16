There are many great tools to do these functions, but to use them you either need a second operating system installed or a bunch of bootable discs. To make your life easier I have compiled a bootable image which contains as many of these tools as possible. This image can be burnt to a DVD or cloned to a iPod/flash USB stick/hard drive/partition; the resulting product will then be bootable. Bootable Utilities Image(BUI) is entirely universal--meaning it will work with intel and PPC macintosh computers--it is also entirely Leopard compatible. \n\nNote that the image itself now runs Leopard (10.5.6).\n\nWhat's included?\nCarbon Copy Cloner 3.2.1\nClone X 3.2.0\nCopyCatX 4.0\nData Rescue II 1.2.2\nDisk Utility 11.1\nDiskWarrior 4.1.1\nDrive Genius 2.1.1\nFileSalvage 6.1.7\nFirmware Password Utility 1.4.3\niDefrag 1.6.8\niPartition 3.1.1\nMacForensicsLab 2.5.3\nMemTest 4.22\nOfficeSalvage 6.1.5\nPreview 4.2 \nRescuePRO 3.3.0.0\nSpeedTools 2.8\nStartup Disk 1.4\nTechTool Pro 5.0.4\nTerminal 2.0.2\nTestDisk 6.11.3\nTextMate 1.5.8\nVolumeWorks 1.5 \n\nNewsletter: Not a newsletter per say, but sign up and receive updates about this project. \n\nSupport Page: http://www.dostuffright.com/BUI \n\nCOMMENTS: \nThere is no update kit for this version. The reason for that is the core itself has been updated. I always try to save you bandwidth when I can, so please be understanding. \nTechTool Pro will ask you to update the TechTool Protection when it first loads; just hit cancel. Also, some of the options in TechTool Pro just don't work. I don't have a working copy from Micromat, so I can't make one for you. \nOfficeSalvage might not be working properly. If you need to recover data I would recommend using Data Rescue.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a5b5a65828d2d9d2a4a14f828fe011f9e63c541","amp;dn":"Bootable+Utilities+Image+2.2.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a5b5a65828d2d9d2a4a14f828fe011f9e63c541","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,91,90,101,130,141,45,157,42,74,20,248,40,254,1,31,158,99,197,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
