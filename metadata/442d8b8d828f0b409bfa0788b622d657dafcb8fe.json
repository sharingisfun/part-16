Individually, the Gresham brothers have released a total of seven long players already on Hospital, each to great critical acclaim. The sum of their combined powers is oozing with the kind of soulful drum + bass, which is the foundation of the Hospital label and will satisfy long term fans who hanker after the golden days of the genre.\n\nHaving brought us the Nu:Logic Ã¢â‚¬Å“New TechniqueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ EP in 2010 and the recently released follow up single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Morning Light / GrizzlyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the duo now bring us their highly anticipated debut album Ã¢â‚¬Å“What IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Always Waited ForÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nOpening with the calm, mellow soothing sounds of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Morning LightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ we are taken through a variety of styles across the 14-track album. Vocal-driven cuts are peppered throughout the album and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s some top collaborations in there, including Ã¢â‚¬Å“Everlasting Days (ft. Lifford)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with its warm, uplifting vibe, the growling spoken swagger of Ã¢â‚¬Å“We Live There (ft. DRS)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the blissed out Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shoot Me Down (ft. Robert Manos)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nElsewhere, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t miss out on the excellent Ã¢â‚¬Å“Start Again (ft. S.P.Y)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with the raw, bass heavy menacing tones, as well as the meditative title track Ã¢â‚¬Å“What IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Always Waited ForÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which is all whirring atmospherics and pattering drums. Two interludes Ã¢â‚¬Å“Escape PodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“DuskÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ successfully segment the album into thirds. With so many musical gems to choose from, one thing is for sure - this has been worth waiting for.\n\n1. Morning Light (06:35)\n2. Brown Shoes (04:57)\n3. Everlasting Days (feat Lifford) (04:55)\n4.
