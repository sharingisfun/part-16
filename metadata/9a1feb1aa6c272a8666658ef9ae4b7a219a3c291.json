As young men, both Anton and Theodor found their lives increasingly troubled. Anton drank heavily, and TheodorÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s career was jeopardized by his participation in a banned political organization. These troubles, combined with growing Prussian authoritarianism, led to their independent emigrations to the United States, Theodor in 1844 and Anton in 1849.\n\nTheodor, tormented by malaria and financial difficulties, returned to Germany, but Anton and his son Bernhard, who emigrated after TheodorÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s return, remained. This separation helped produce a remarkable body of correspondence describing the van DreveldtsÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´ often troubled relationships with each other, their homeland, and America. Their letters compare the age-old tribulations of Europe against the promise and challenges of a new country. The van DreveldtsÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´ experiences provide a fascinating glimpse into the complexities of immigrant life","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a1feb1aa6c272a8666658ef9ae4b7a219a3c291","amp;dn":"Lives+and+Letters+of+an+Immigrant+Family+%281844-1866%29++%281998%29+%2845","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a1feb1aa6c272a8666658ef9ae4b7a219a3c291","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,31,235,26,166,194,114,168,102,102,88,239,154,228,183,162,25,163,194,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
