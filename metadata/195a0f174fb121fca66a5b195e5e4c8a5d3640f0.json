Outrageous and charming, this not-so-dumb blonde has been portrayed on stage and screen by Carol Channing and Marilyn Monroe and has become the archetype of the footloose, good-hearted gold digger (not that she sees herself that way). Masquerading as her diaries, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes follows Lorelei as she entertains suitors across Europe before returning home to marry a millionaire. In this delightfully droll and witty book, Lorelei s glamorous pragmatism shines, as does Anita Loos s mastery of irony and dialect. A craze in its day and with ageless appeal, this new Liveright edition puts Lorelei back where she belongs: front and center.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:195a0f174fb121fca66a5b195e5e4c8a5d3640f0","amp;dn":"Gentlemen+Prefer+Blondes+-+Anita+Loos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"195a0f174fb121fca66a5b195e5e4c8a5d3640f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,90,15,23,79,177,33,252,166,106,91,25,94,94,76,138,93,54,64,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
