This two-hour special brings\nhis words to life. Shot like a graphic novel, it weaves\ntogether several epic stories, including the story of\nSun Tzu himself, and a war soon after his death where a\ncity is saved using his tactics as China takes the first\nstep toward unification. We'll also follow other epic\nbattles in history--Roman battles, The Civil War, WWII,\nand present day--that illustrate more of Sun Tzu's lessons,\nto detail how the people who understand his strategy are\nthe most dangerous weapons of all. And while his ideals\nwere originally created for battle, his lessons could\nbe used by anye used by anyone who wants to win--whether at sports,\nbusiness, or life.\n\nRelease  Notes\n\nGroup Greets\n\nCTU, ORENJi, 2HD, DHD\n\nand all other groups that choose quality over speed\n\nContact Info\n\nWe are currently looking for:\n\n* US/CA cappers with HDTV and/or DSR feed - min 60 kB/s\n\nGROUP NEWS: No, we will not affil your brand new/DR/colo site,\nso please don't ask.
