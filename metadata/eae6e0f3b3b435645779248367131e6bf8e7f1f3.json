I will seed for a while but it definitely helps when others seed to help share it as fast as possible.\n\nIf in Vuze, go to 'File -&gt; Open Torrent File' and select the torrent file, and then deselect the formats you do not want.\n\nI will also be uploading &quot;Take This To Your Grave&quot; in V0, ALAC, FLAC, and CBR 320. I bought that one too because I couldn't find a good quality rip that didn't skip on &quot;Homesick At Space Camp.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eae6e0f3b3b435645779248367131e6bf8e7f1f3","amp;dn":"Fall+Out+Boy+-+From+Under+the+Cork+Tree+%28Ltd+Edition%29+%28V0%2C+FLAC%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eae6e0f3b3b435645779248367131e6bf8e7f1f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,230,224,243,179,180,53,100,87,121,36,131,103,19,30,107,248,231,241,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
