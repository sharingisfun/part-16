On this date, recorded in mid-2012 during a handful of shows\nat one of New York's most iconic venues, Ribot gives himself the luxury of\nstretching out with a pair of gifted accompanists, bassist Henry Grimes (who\nworked with Albert Ayler, one of Ribot's key influences) and drummer Chad\nTaylor (a veteran of the Chicago Underground Duo and Trio), and the result is\none of Ribot's most explicitly jazz-focused dates in some time. Live at the\nVillage Vanguard certainly embraces Ribot's particular tastes in jazz,\nfeaturing two Ayler compositions (&quot;The Wizard&quot; and &quot;Bells&quot;) as well as two\npieces recorded by John Coltrane (&quot;Sun Ship&quot; and &quot;Dearly Beloved&quot;) and a pair\nof old standards (&quot;Old Man River&quot; and &quot;I'm Confessin' [That I Love You]&quot;). In\nthe grand tradition of the genre, the key here is the interplay between the\nmusicians, not simply the bandleader, though the sharp report of Ribot's tone\nand the volleys of notes he fires off during the more extreme passages will\nsound more than familiar to anyone acquainted with his work. On the standards,\nRibot, Grimes, and Taylor may seem relaxed, but they dig deep into the melodies\nand find rich, expressive treasure despite the deceptively accessible\nsurfaces. And as the trio explores the selections from Coltrane and Ayler's\nsongbooks, the communication between the players is total, with each in full\nflight as individuals and as a group, honoring the masters and finding a voice\nof their own at the same time. The great free jazz guitarist Sonny Sharrock\nonce quipped that he didn't consider himself a guitarist, but a sax player with\na very messed-up horn; Live at the Village Vanguard suggests a bit of the same\nthinking lurks inside Mark Ribot, but in spite of that, he and his axe seem to\nbe getting along just fine.\n\n--\n\nBy Paul Acquaro &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2014/06/marc-ribot-live-at-village-vanguard-pi.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2014/06/marc-ribot-live-at-village-vanguard-pi.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Mark Corroto &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/live-at-the-village-vanguard-marc-ribot-pi-recordings-review-by-mark-corroto.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/live-at-the-village-vanguard-marc-ribot-pi-recordings-review-by-mark-corroto.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Dan Bilawsky &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/marc-ribot-trio-live-at-the-village-vanguard-by-dan-bilawsky.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/marc-ribot-trio-live-at-the-village-vanguard-by-dan-bilawsky.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Troy Collins &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/live-at-the-village-vanguard-marc-ribot-pi-recordings-review-by-troy-collins.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/live-at-the-village-vanguard-marc-ribot-pi-recordings-review-by-troy-collins.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Tim Niland\n\nPar Guillaume Bourgault-CÃƒÂ´tÃƒÂ© (fr) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ledevoir.com/culture/musique/412605/live-at-the-village-vanguard-marc-ribot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ledevoir.com/culture/musique/412605/live-at-the-village-vanguard-marc-ribot&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPor HÃƒÂ©ctor Aravena A.
