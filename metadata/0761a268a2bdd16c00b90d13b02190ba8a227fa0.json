There the vicious local police chief sets his sights on her, unaware that she is a fugitive.\n\nMy notes\n\nThis is part of a collection of Hollywood precode films and my library acquired it as film history.  Precode means that before the Hayes office stipulated strict guidelines for what was permissible on film, such movies as Safe In Hell are about bad girls (other titles in the series include &quot;Ten Cents A Dance&quot;) and mostly bad girls rather than bad boys.  It is the era of the early talkies; the 30's.  Another feature and topic I saw as a torrent from the period is &quot;Elysia: Valley of the Nude&quot; -- a show about nudism at the dawn of the age of talkies.  While there is the aire of exploitation in these early films it gives an inkling f how serious drama might have developed without the code imposed on fimmaking.\n\nThe precode period is fun to watch.  Notice how lighting a match can speak volumes about the character.  Enjoy.\n\nNotes written May 8th, 2013\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0761a268a2bdd16c00b90d13b02190ba8a227fa0","amp;dn":"Safe+In+Hell+%281931%29+a+Hollywood+Precode+feature","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0761a268a2bdd16c00b90d13b02190ba8a227fa0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,97,162,104,162,189,209,108,0,185,13,19,176,33,144,186,138,34,127,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
