Formed in 1991 in Northampton, Massachusetts, it comprised Joe Pernice, Stephen Desaulniers, Bruce Tull and Tom Shea. Stephen Desaulniers left the band and was replaced by Frank Padellaro in Oct. 1996.\n\nThe band at first was known as the Scuds, and their early work was influenced by electric rock. However, they sat round Tull's kitchen table every night and played acoustic country tunes, and soon decided that they enjoyed this style more. This culminated in the Scud Mountain Boys bringing the table to a concert and playing while sitting down, a move which was enthusiastically welcomed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca19b442da4193a2d993a1c38e41210b34b56921","amp;dn":"Scud+Mountain+Boys+-+The+Early+Year","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca19b442da4193a2d993a1c38e41210b34b56921","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,25,180,66,218,65,147,162,217,147,161,195,142,65,33,11,52,181,105,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
