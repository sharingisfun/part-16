Following on the heels of Stress Science: Neuroendocrinology and Stress Consequences: Mental, Neuropsychological and Socioeconomic, this third derivative volume will provide a readily accessible and affordable compendium that explains the phenomenon of stress as it relates physically and mentally to war, conflict and disaster.  The first section will be dedicated to study of the link between stress and various forms of conflict.  Specific instances of conflict will be discussed - the Gulf wars, Korea, Hiroshima bombing, the Holocaust, 9/11, Northern Ireland, terrorism in general, torture.  The second section will explore the stress impact of more general physical disasters such as airline and vehicle accidents, earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes.  The final section will focus on the clinical relationship between conflict stress and various mental diseases - PTSD, suicide, disaster syndrome, etc - as well as the adverse impact of stress on human physical health in general. \n\nComprised of about 100 top articles selected from Elsevier's Encyclopedias of Stress, the volume will provide a valuable desk reference that will put relevant articles readily at the fingertips of all scientists who consider stress.\n\n. Chapters offer impressive and unique scope with topics addressing the  relationship between stress generated by war, conflict and disaster and  various physical/mental disorders . Richly illustrated with over 200 figures, dozens in color . Articles carefully selected by one of the world's most preeminent stress researchers and contributors represent the most outstanding scholarship in the field, with each chapter providing fully vetted and reliable expert knowledge\n\n\n# Hardcover: 896 pages\n# Publisher: Academic Press; 1 edition (September 15, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0123813816\n# ISBN-13: 978-0123813817","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21296229e43924f65cd59a16af587296543b2e1b","amp;dn":"Stress+of+War%2C+Conflict+and+Disaster+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21296229e43924f65cd59a16af587296543b2e1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,41,98,41,228,57,36,246,92,213,154,22,175,88,114,150,84,59,46,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
