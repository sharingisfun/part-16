The mummies are the protectors of the Prince. The mummies (Ja-Kal, Rath, Armon &amp; Nefer-Tina) have the ability to transform and get special powers. They use these powers to fight off the evil villains, mostly Scarab, who is after the spirit of Prince Rapses for immortality.&quot;\n\nCopied from the original release:\n&quot;Seven of the 42 episodes are DVDRips, the rest are encoded from episodes recorded on old VHS tapes.  I cleaned up the audio and video of the VHS tape rips as much as possible... but there has been some degradation (which is to be expected).  There are one or two episodes that are more distorted than the others; however, all of the episodes are watchable.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60b5d85bb0a068d294293d860519b597c2dd4796","amp;dn":"Mummies+Alive%21+%28Complete+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60b5d85bb0a068d294293d860519b597c2dd4796","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,181,216,91,176,160,104,210,148,41,61,134,5,25,181,151,194,221,71,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
