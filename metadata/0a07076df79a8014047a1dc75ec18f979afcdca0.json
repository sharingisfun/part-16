A video recording of this concert was released on DVD in 2003. Original US editions are rare because Tetragrammaton went bankrupt while the album was still being issued. This also led to the cancellation of a tour supporting The Rolling Stones. This album was re-released the following year by Deep Purple's new US label Warner Bros.
