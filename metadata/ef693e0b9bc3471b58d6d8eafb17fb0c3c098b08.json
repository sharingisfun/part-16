JetAudio takes time to start playing the music you choose. WinAmp does not. And WinAmp has really cool visualizations.)\n\nAlso APE and flac take way too much space. I have 900GB of music at 256kps mp3. If it used APE it would need 4 or 5 1000GB drives.\n\nWhen I download stuff in flac, at least I can use Switch to convert it to reasonable size, though it uses an awful lot of internet resource to get it. I have so much good jazz that usually I skip flac and APE. \n\nI wish people would upload in 256kps, or 320kps, mp3.\n\nPlease download the Tatum Groups both ways and tell me honestly whether you can hear a difference. Please tell me if I am missing anything. \n\nI do hear mp3 ripped from my vinyl LPs as better than mp3 ripped from WAV CDs, and so I think the suits must do a shitty job of converting to CD WAV.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef693e0b9bc3471b58d6d8eafb17fb0c3c098b08","amp;dn":"Jazz+-+Art+Tatum%2C+Pablo+Group+Masterpieces+%40+256kps+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef693e0b9bc3471b58d6d8eafb17fb0c3c098b08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,105,62,11,155,195,71,27,88,214,216,234,251,23,251,12,60,9,139,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
