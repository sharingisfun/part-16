Indeed, the Bronze Age Aegean was a distant memory even to the original audiences of these works.\n\nBut age seems only to have burnished the luster of this epic.\n\nIt may be precisely because of its very strangeness and distance that generation after generation of readers have come to love it so much.\n\nThis strangeness and distance throw sharply into focus the timeless human issues that ride along on OdysseusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s journey, voyaging to strange lands on the shores of wine-dark seas, dealing face-to-face with gods and monsters.\n\nA Single Riveting Question... and the Others It Raises\n\nThe epicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s exploration centers around a single question about the protagonist, and the two related questions it immediately suggests:\nWhy does Odysseus long so powerfully to go home? \nWhat holds people together and keeps them going in extreme situations such as war or shipwreck? \nWhy do we love our own so strongly? \n\nIt is this universal theme that seems of paramount importance. What does it mean to live?\n\nProfessor Vandiver builds her analyses skillfully around meticulous, insightful examinations of the most important episodes in the Odyssey.\n\nShe explains the cultural assumptions that lie behind HomerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lines, and you join her in weighing the basic critical and interpretive issues.\n\nJust as knowledge of the Trojan War legend is necessary for understanding the IliadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½available as a companion courseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the Odyssey assumes that its audience knows how the war ended and what happened next.\n\nLearn the Story between the Epics\n\nLecture 1. We begin with an overview of the traditional Trojan War story that took place after the Iliad. Next we examine the difference between kleos epic, with its primary focus on glory, and nostos epic, which focuses instead on homecoming. \n\nLecture 2. This lecture defines and examines xenia, a concept that is of key importance for understanding the Odyssey and the characters of Telemachos and the suitors.\n\nXenia is usually translated &quot;guest-host relationship.&quot; It is a reciprocal relationship between two xenoiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a word which means guest, host, stranger, friend, and foreigner. It is not based on friendship, but rather on obligation.\n\nIn addition to examining xenia, the lecture also highlights two other important narrative elements established in the Telemachy:\nthe use of Agamemnon's story as a parallel for Odysseus's own \nTelemachos's need to assert his maturity. \n\nLecture 3. In this lecture, we turn to Odysseus himself as a character in the Odyssey. \n\nThe lecture concentrates on the aspects of Odysseus's character that are introduced in these two books:\nhis desire to return home as a desire to reestablish his own identity \nhis superb skills as a rhetorician, able to craft his speech to appeal to whomever he is addressing. \n\nEnter Odysseus... in His Own Voice\n\nLecture 4. This lecture continues to follow Odysseus's interactions with the Phaiakians, and moves on into the beginnings of his own great narrative of his past adventures.\n\nThe lecture addresses several key themes, including the continued importance of xenia as offered by the Phaiakians and how the conception of kleos in the Odyssey differs from that of the Iliad. \n\nProfessor Vandiver also discusses how the appearance of the bard Demodokos in Book VIII may reflect the original three-day performance structure of the Odyssey. \n\nAs the lecture concludes, we see how the encounter with the cyclops Polyphemos shows Odysseus at his most clever and quick-thinking but also causes all his subsequent troubles.\n\nLecture 5. We continue following OdysseusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own narrative of the &quot;Great Wanderings&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½OdysseusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s narrative of his trip to HadesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including an examination of his encounter with Circe and the implications of the sexual double standard reflected in it and in the rest of the Odyssey. \n\nA Journey into Hades\n\nThe lecture looks at the first half of the pivotal episode in the Great Wanderings and ends with a discussion of the reasons for and effects of the abrupt break in the text, where the poem returns briefly to the third-person narrative.\n\nLecture 6. This lecture continues to look at OdysseusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s narrative of his journey to Hades. \n\nProfessor Vandiver notes elements in the Hades narrative that seem particularly designed to enchant OdysseusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Phaiakian audience.\n\nShe also considers the vexing question of OdysseusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own veracity before moving on to the final episode of the &quot;Great Wanderings&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the killing of HeliosÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cattle and the death of OdysseusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s remaining companions. \n\nLecture 7. This lecture moves to the second half of the Odyssey by discussing the change in pace and subject matter in the &quot;Ithakan&quot; books.\n\nThe lecture looks in detail at several important moments in the story:\nOdysseusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s arrival on Ithaka \nthe significance for xenia of the formulaic lines he speaks here for the third time \nhis encounter with the disguised Athena \ntheir plan for his vengeance on the suitors. \n\nLecture 8. The two books covered in this lecture, XVI and XVII, include OdysseusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reunion with his son Telemachos and his entry into his own palace disguised as a beggar.\n\nFollow OdysseusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Trials of Suppression\n\nThroughout this section of the Odyssey the poet stresses OdysseusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s emotional trials, for he must not:\nshow joy at the sight of Telemachos \ndisplay anger at the evil goatherd, Melanthios \nreveal sorrow at the death of his dog Argos. \n\nEach encounter reiterates OdysseusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s supreme self-control and moves him closer to his utmost danger and most extreme trial.\n\nLecture 9. This lecture looks in close detail at the two lengthy conversations between OdysseusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½still disguised as a beggarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and Penelope in Book XIX, and the scene that separates those conversations, in which Eurykleia recognizes Odysseus.\n\nLecture 10. This lecture, which covers Books XX through XXII, examines the &quot;contest of the bow,&quot; OdysseusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s revelation of his identity to the loyal slaves Eumaios and Philoitios, and the slaughter of the suitors.\n\nProfessor Vandiver continues her consideration of PenelopeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s knowledge and motives, as well as her focus on HomerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s narrative strategies for increasing the sense of inevitability as the suitorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ doom approaches.\n\nLecture 11. This last lecture on the Odyssey itself discusses the final reunion of Odysseus and Penelope in Book XXIII and the resolution of several themes and issues in Book XXIV.\n\nDoes Homer's Ending Work?\n\nThe lecture concludes with an examination of the Odyssey's ending and a discussion of whether or not it is effective.\n\nLecture 12. In this final lecture, Professor Vandiver turns to the question of whether the Trojan War has any historical basis.\n\nAfter looking at the history of this question, she recounts the story of Heinrich SchliemannÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 19th-century excavations at Hisarlik and Mycenae and examines some of the issues still left unresolved by those excavations.\n\n30 minutes / lecture \n\n01.
