With flavors of jazz, blues and rock and roll, the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cross-genre appeal and instrumental prowess have earned them fans across the roots music world. Their debut album for Compass RecordsÃ¢â‚¬â€From Bamako to CarencroÃ¢â‚¬â€takes its name from the cultural connection between Bamako, in Mali, West Africa, and Louisiana, symbolized in name by the Lafayette, LA suburb of Carencro. Featured on the album are band members Michael Doucet (fiddle and lead vocals), David Doucet (guitar and vocals), Billy Ware (percussion) and Tommy Alissi (drums) and Mitchell Reed (bass and fiddle). Guests Jessie LÃƒÂ©ge (button accordion), Cory Ledet (piano accordion), and special guest, multi-instrumentalist Don Vappe (acoustic bass, electric bass, electric guitar, mandolin) round out the mix.\n\nThe new album includes the celebrated Cajun/Creole-rooted music the band is known for, but also includes some notable jazz, blues and R&amp;B elements. Standout tracks include the Roswell Rudd composition Ã¢â‚¬Å“BamakoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a haunting and hypnotic Michael Doucet original entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“CarencoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a Cajun swing version of ColtraneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“BessieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s BluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and a surprising cover of James BrownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Go Crazy.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Port Arthur Two-StepÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ features a duet between Michael Doucet and brother David Doucet, and band bassist and 2nd fiddler Mitchell Reed contributes the infectious Ã¢â‚¬Å“Creole Jig.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The album was recorded at the legendary Dockside Studios in Maurice, LA and mixed at Compass Sound Studio in Nashville, TN...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:754aa0d8f720029c227eb528e83f80634794cb26","amp;dn":"BeauSoleil+-+From+Bamako+to+Carencro+%5B2013%5D%5BLog.Cue%2CFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"754aa0d8f720029c227eb528e83f80634794cb26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,74,160,216,247,32,2,156,34,126,181,40,232,63,128,99,71,148,203,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
