(John Coleman, Humane Studies Review)A welcome, refreshing, and solid contribution to relearning what we have forgotten and remembering why this nation is good, and worth defending. (Matthew Spalding, National Review --The Wall Street Journal\n\nProduct Description\n\nFor at least thirty years, high school and college students have been taught to be embarrassed by American history. Required readings have become skewed toward a relentless focus on our countryÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s darkest moments, from slavery to McCarthyism. As a result, many history books devote more space to Harriet Tubman than to Abraham Lincoln; more to My Lai than to the American Revolution; more to the internment of Japanese Americans than to the liberation of Europe in World War II.\nNow, finally, there is an antidote to this biased approach to our history. Two veteran history professors have written a sweeping, well-researched book that puts the spotlight back on AmericaÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s role as a beacon of liberty to the rest of the world.\n\nSchweikart and Allen are careful to tell their story straight, from ColumbusÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voyage to the capture of Saddam Hussein. They do not ignore AmericaÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mistakes through the years, but they put them back in their proper perspective. And they conclude that AmericaÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s place as a world leader derived largely from the virtues of our own leadersÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the men and women who cleared the wilderness, abolished slavery, and rid the world of fascism and communism.\n\nThe authors write in a clear and enjoyable style that makes history a pleasure, not just for students but also for adults who want to learn what their teachers skipped over.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3757f5f64879a499db0747c9247fcac540e0c436","amp;dn":"A+Patriots+History+of+the+United+States%2C+Kindle+and+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3757f5f64879a499db0747c9247fcac540e0c436","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,87,245,246,72,121,164,153,219,7,71,201,36,127,202,197,64,224,196,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
