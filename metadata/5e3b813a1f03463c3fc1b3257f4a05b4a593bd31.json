Cale - Shades\nYear: 1980\nLabel: Mercury\nTotal time: 33:22\nBitrate: 320 kbps\n\nAfter the relative polish of '5', J. J. Cale reclaimed some of the smoky ambience of earlier albums with this 1980 offering.  The blues of 'Shades' leans a little toward jazz with the five-minute instrumentals, 'Pack My Jack' and 'Cloudy Day', but both of these, especially the sax on the latter are superb.  'Runaround' is of a similar style.  The more familiar blues/boogie is represented on 'Deep Dark Dungeon' and 'Love Has Been Gone', which features some great guitar interplay.  'What Do You Expect' is a funkier track, while 'Wish I Had Not Said That' is a slower, more reflective item.  On some of the tracks, Christine Lakeland adds an almost whispering harmony vocal which has a slightly eerie effect. Meanwhile, 'Mama Don't' lends a touch of humour and the haste of 'Carry On' provides an arresting opening to the album. Full of infectious tunes and rhythms, 'Shades' was my introduction to Cale and is a great album.~ D.J.H. Thorn, Amazon.com\n\nPersonnel:\nJ.J.
