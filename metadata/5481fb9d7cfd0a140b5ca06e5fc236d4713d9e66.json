This is a retrospective documentary on the life and music of saxophonist John Coltrane, featuring reminiscences and interviews with his contemporaries and fellow musicians.\nThe documentary is narrated by Ed Wheeler and directed by Robert Palmer and Toby Byron. Because Coltrane died from liver disease in 1967, there isn't that much footage available and you sense they were struggling to find source material. Hence the reliance on reminiscences and lots of fancy zooms on stills. Of great interest to Coltrane scholars will be the recording of John Coltrane while in the Navy (1947) playing the alto saxophone (on Charlie Parker's &quot;Koko&quot;)--by far the earliest recording of the saxophonist that has yet surfaced, and a few excerpts from concert and studio performances. Most of the footage is in black and white, apart from an excerpt of Coltrane's last quartet (featuring wife Alice Coltrane on piano and Rashied Ali on drums) performing in concert in colour.\nThe documentary focuses very much on the middle period of Coltrane's career, with only brief references to his rhythm and blue roots, collaborations with Jimmy Heath, and his participation in the Miles Davis Quintet. Much of the documentary focuses on the classic John Coltrane Quartet (with pianist McCoy Tyner, drummer Elvin Jones, and bassist Jimmy Garrison), from about the period of My Favorite Things to A Love Supreme.\n\nMusicians interviewed include:\n\nRoscoe Mitchell (saxophonist) Rashied Ali (drummer)\nTommy Flanagan (pianist) Jimmy Heath (saxophonist)\nWayne Shorter (saxophonist) La Monte Young (composer)\nAlice Coltrane (wife, pianist, harpist)\n\nTracks\n\n1.A Love Supreme 2.Alabama 3.Blue Monk\n4.Dahomey Dance 5.Dear Lord 6.Eight Miles High\n7.Giant Steps 8.Gospel Song 1 9.Gospel Song 2\n10.Hot House 11.Impressions 12.Impressions 2\n13.India 14.Koko 15.Moroccan Folk Song\n16.My Favorite Things 17.My Favorite Things 2\n18.Naima 19.Number One 20.Raga Bhimpalisi\n21.Roscoe In Morocco 22.Round Midnight\n23.So What 24.Things To Come\n\n\n\nTechnical Information:\n\nGeneral\nComplete name         : H:\\The World According To John Coltrane ['90].avi\nFormat                      : Audio Video Interleave\nDuration                         : 59mn 24s\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 642 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                            : 0\nFormat                    : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile        : Advanced Simple@L5\nCodec                     : XviD\nBit rate                   : 1 441 Kbps\nWidth   x Height    : 592 x 432 pixels\nFrame rate             : 25.000 fps\nScan type               : Progressive\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                       : MPEG Audio Version 1 Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps Constant\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5481fb9d7cfd0a140b5ca06e5fc236d4713d9e66","amp;dn":"The+World+According+To+John+Coltrane+%28jazz%29%28avi%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5481fb9d7cfd0a140b5ca06e5fc236d4713d9e66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,129,251,157,124,253,10,20,11,92,160,110,95,194,54,212,113,61,158,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
