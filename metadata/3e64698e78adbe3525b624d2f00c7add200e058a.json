Beginning in the psychedelic year of 1967 and influenced by the Beatles, the band early on turned out eclectic pop singles in its native Great Britain, though by the end of its first year of existence it had developed a pop/rock hybrid tied to its unusual instrumentation: At a time when electric guitars ruled rock, Traffic emphasized Winwood's organ and the reed instruments played by Chris Wood, especially flute. After Dave Mason, who had provided the band with an alternate folk-pop sound, departed for good, Traffic leaned toward extended songs that gave its players room to improvise in a jazz-like manner, even as the rhythms maintained a rock structure. The result was international success that ended only when Winwood finally decided he was ready to strike out on his own.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nAfter spending the majority of his late-teen years being mistaken -- in the realm of audio -- for Ray Charles, the Spencer Davis Group's &quot;little&quot; Stevie Winwood found himself at the helm of one of the most promising and volatile bands of the late '60/early '70s, Traffic. The initial core foursome of Winwood, Jim Capaldi, Dave Mason, and Chris Wood successfully went from psychedelic art rockers to blues-rock &quot;jamathoners&quot; without losing any momentum, cranking out both concise, pop-oriented radio singles (&quot;Paper Sun,&quot; &quot;Dear Mr. Fantasy&quot;) and rambling epics (&quot;Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys,&quot; &quot;John Barleycorn&quot;) with equal amounts of elegance and swagger. Despite numerous lineup changes, side projects, and endless clashes between Winwood and Mason, the group lasted well into the '70s, a good chunk of which appears here on the double-disc, liner-note-heavy Gold. While previous Island collections like Feelin' Alright: The Very Best of Traffic and 20th Century Masters - The Millennium Collection dutifully cover the radio essentials, Gold provides both newbies and longtime fans with a fully stocked buffet of fan favorites and album highlights.\n\nDisc 1\n01.Paper Sun\n02.Dealer\n03.Coloured Rain\n04.Hole In My Shoe\n05.No Face, No Name, No Number\n06.Heaven Is In Your Mind\n07.Smiling Phases\n08.Dear Mr. Fantasy\n09.You Can All Join In\n10.Pearly Queen\n11.Feelin' Alright\n12.Who Knows What Tomorrow May Bring\n13.Forty Thousand Headmen\n14.Shanghai Noodle Factory\n15.Medicated Goo\n16.Glad\n17.Freedom Rider\n18.Empty Pages\n19.John Barleycorn\n\nDisc 2\n01.Gimme Some Lovin'\n02.Low Spark Of High-Heeled Boys\n03.Light Up Or Leave Me Alone\n04.Rock &amp; Roll Stew\n05.Rainmaker\n06.Shoot Out At The Fantasy Factory\n07.(Sometimes I Feel So) Uninspired\n08.Something New\n09.Dream Gerrard\n10.Walking In The Wind\n11.When The Eagle Flies\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e64698e78adbe3525b624d2f00c7add200e058a","amp;dn":"Traffic+-+Gold+%282005%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e64698e78adbe3525b624d2f00c7add200e058a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,100,105,142,120,173,190,53,37,182,36,210,240,12,122,221,32,14,5,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
