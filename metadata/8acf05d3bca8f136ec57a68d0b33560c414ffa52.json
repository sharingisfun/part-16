That brainstorming meetings are a terrible idea? That the color blue can help you double your creative output?\n\nFrom the best-selling author of How We Decide comes a sparkling and revelatory look at the new science of creativity. Shattering the myth of muses, higher powers, even creative ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtypes,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Jonah Lehrer demonstrates that creativity is not a single gift possessed by the lucky few. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a variety of distinct thought processes that we can all learn to use more effectively. Lehrer reveals the importance of embracing the rut, thinking like a child, and daydreaming productively, then he takes us out of our own heads to show how we can make our neighborhoods more vibrant, our companies more productive, and our schools more effective. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn about Bob DylanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s writing habits and the drug addiction of poets. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll meet a bartender who thinks like a chemist, and an autistic surfer who invented an entirely new surfing move. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll see why Elizabethan England experienced a creative explosion, and how Pixar designed its office space to get the most out of its talent. Collapsing the layers separating the neuron from the finished symphony, Imagine reveals the deep inventiveness of the human mind, and its essential role in our increasingly complex world. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.jonahlehrer.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.jonahlehrer.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8acf05d3bca8f136ec57a68d0b33560c414ffa52","amp;dn":"Imagine_+How+Creativity+Works+-+Jonah+Lehrer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8acf05d3bca8f136ec57a68d0b33560c414ffa52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,207,5,211,188,168,241,54,236,87,166,141,11,51,86,12,65,79,250,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
