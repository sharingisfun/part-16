All the members of the band are Christians, and this is reflected in some of the band's songs. However, they prefer not to be called a Christian band. On the topic of their faith, Mike Herrera has been quoted saying &quot;We are Christian. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a cult or something. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s part of our story and I guess itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s different and controversial. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a personal thing. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what we choose to believe. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all there is to it. We donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t preach to anyone.&quot;\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - July 2012\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd14c518dfc80e50a27b3a55ea22a53643ff157b","amp;dn":"MxPx+Discography+1994-2012+%2833+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd14c518dfc80e50a27b3a55ea22a53643ff157b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,20,197,24,223,200,14,80,162,123,58,85,234,34,165,54,67,255,21,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
