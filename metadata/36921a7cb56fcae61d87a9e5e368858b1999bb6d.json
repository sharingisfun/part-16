The \ntracks were chosen by Mitchell herself, and her selections \nconcentrate on her lesser known, more experimental work, \nincluding jazz influenced recordings from the late 1970s and \nelectronic music from the 1980s. Mitchell also designed the \nalbum cover.The album is a companion to Hits, issued on the \nsame day. Mitchell agreed to a request from her record company \nto release a greatest hits album on the condition that she \nwould also be allowed to release Misses\n\nJoni Mitchell, CC [born Roberta Joan Anderson; November 7, 1943] \nis a Canadian musician, singer songwriter, and painter. Mitchell \nbegan singing in small nightclubs in Saskatchewan and Western \nCanada and then busking in the streets and dives of Toronto. In \n1965 she moved to the United States and, touring constantly \nbegan to be recognized when her original songs [&quot;Urge for Going&quot; \n&quot;Chelsea Morning&quot;, &quot;Both Sides, Now&quot;, &quot;The Circle Game&quot;] were \ncovered by notable folk singers, allowing her to sign with Reprise \nRecords and record her own debut album in 1968.[2] Settling in \nSouthern California, Mitchell, with popular songs like \n&quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot; and &quot;Woodstock&quot;, helped define an era and a \ngeneration. Her more starkly personal 1971 recording Blue has \nbeen called one of the best albums ever made. Musically restless\nMitchell switched labels and began moving toward jazz rhythms by \nway of lush pop textures on 1974's Court and Spark, her \nbest-selling LP, featuring the radio hits &quot;Help Me&quot; and \n&quot;Free Man in Paris\n\n\n\nFile Format:  FLAC\nCodec: LAME 3.99.5\nNumber of Albums: 01\nNumber of Tracks: 14\nVersion: MPEG 1 Layer III\nChannels: 2 Channels Stereo / 44100 Hz\nQuality:  [FLAC avg. bitrate: 759 kbps]\nAlbum Title: Misses\nArtist / Group: Joni Mitchell\nAlbum Release Year: 1987\nArtwork: Embedded Within Audio Files\nGenre: Folk / Folk jazz / Electronica / pop \nTotal Size: 416 MB [437,029,291 bytes]\nTotal Duration: 1:07:50.960 [179 529 336 samples]\nRipper:  Exact Audio Copy V1.0 beta 3 - Secure Mode, Test &amp; Copy, AccurateRip\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://d22.e-loader.net/rWqrh0nYji.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://d22.e-loader.net/rWqrh0nYji.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://d12.e-loader.net/ETcOHyVytq.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://d12.e-loader.net/ETcOHyVytq.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://d4.e-loader.net/uUl0LZanml.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://d4.e-loader.net/uUl0LZanml.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n01 - Passion Play [When All The Slaves Are Free] [5mn 24s ][ 759 Kbps ][ 29.3 MiB ] \n02 - Nothing Can Be Done [4mn 51s ][ 946 Kbps ][ 32.9 MiB ] \n03 - A Case Of You [4mn 25s ][ 759 Kbps ][ 24.0 MiB ] \n04 - The Beat Of Black Wings [5mn 24s ][ 939 Kbps ][ 36.4 MiB ] \n05 - Dog Eat Dog [4mn 42s ][ 840 Kbps ][ 28.3 MiB ] \n06 - The Wolf That Lives In Lindsey [6mn 35s ][ 728 Kbps ][ 34.3 MiB ] \n07 - The Magdalene Laundries [4mn 4s ][ 796 Kbps ][ 23.2 MiB ] \n08 - Impossible Dreamer [4mn 31s ][ 842 Kbps ][ 27.2 MiB ] \n09 - Sex Kills [3mn 57s ][ 901 Kbps ][ 25.5 MiB ] \n10 - The Reoccurring Dream [3mn 5s ][ 952 Kbps ][ 21.1 MiB ] \n11 - Harry's House/Centerpiece [6mn 48s ][ 840 Kbps ][ 40.9 MiB ] \n12 - The Arrangement [3mn 35s ][ 657 Kbps ][ 16.8 MiB ] \n13 - For The Roses [3mn 43s ][ 772 Kbps ][ 20.6 MiB ] \n14 - Hejira [6mn 42s ][ 671 Kbps ][ 32.2 MiB ] \n\n\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36921a7cb56fcae61d87a9e5e368858b1999bb6d","amp;dn":"Joni+Mitchell+-+Misses+1996+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36921a7cb56fcae61d87a9e5e368858b1999bb6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,146,26,124,181,111,202,230,29,135,169,229,227,104,133,139,25,153,187,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
