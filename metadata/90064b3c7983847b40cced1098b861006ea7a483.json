It explores topics that readers will relate to, but often misunderstand, such as 'opposites attract', 'people use only 10% of their brains', and 'handwriting reveals your personality'. Besides the 50 great myths, the book also includes over 200 additional psychological myths for readers to explore and features a postscript of remarkable psychological findings that sound like myths but that are true.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90064b3c7983847b40cced1098b861006ea7a483","amp;dn":"50+GREAT+MYTHS+OF+POPULAR+PSYCHOLOGY+-+Scott+O.+Lilienfeld","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90064b3c7983847b40cced1098b861006ea7a483","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,6,75,60,121,131,132,123,64,204,237,16,152,184,97,0,110,167,164,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
