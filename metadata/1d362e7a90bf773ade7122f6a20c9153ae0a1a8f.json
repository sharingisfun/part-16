In its 8 years of existence, approximately 250,000 inmates from 35 countries were imprisoned here. The inmates were submitted to the life of slaves, working for the Third Reich, and were easily replaced by a regular influx of new prisoners. Ravensbruck Concentration Camp - Women from more than 20 countries were inmates between the years 1939 and 1945 at the Ravensbruck Concentration Camp in Germany. They were maltreated, humiliated and tortured to death.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d362e7a90bf773ade7122f6a20c9153ae0a1a8f","amp;dn":"The+Holocaust+%28Ravensbruck+%26+Buchenwald+Camps%29+%5BDVDRip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d362e7a90bf773ade7122f6a20c9153ae0a1a8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,54,46,122,144,191,119,58,222,113,34,246,162,12,145,83,174,10,26,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
