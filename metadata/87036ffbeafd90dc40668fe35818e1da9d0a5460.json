The core of Aspect's superb sound are two analog modeled oscillators, each capable of producing a powerful selection of raw waveforms, and dual filters that can be routed in series, in parallel, or even blended into unique combinations.\n\nModulation sources comes in the form of three analog modeled envelopes, capable of producing quick, snappy attacks, and three flexible LFOs, which can be synced to tempo.\n\nA flexible patch section allows sources to be combined and processed to produce complex modulations from simple sources, whilst a versatile modulation architecture allows practically anything to be used as a modulation source and destination.\n\nWith optimised audio algorithms that won't overload your processor, rock-solid stability, and easy integration with any MIDI hardware controller, Aspect is ideal for live work. With a simple and intuitive interface, flexible Bank and Program management, and total parameter automation, Aspect fits right into your studio environment.\n\nHomepage: http://www.loomer.co.uk/aspect.htm\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87036ffbeafd90dc40668fe35818e1da9d0a5460","amp;dn":"Loomer+Aspect+STANDALONE+VSTi+RTAS+v1.7.4+x86%2Fx64+%5Bak%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87036ffbeafd90dc40668fe35818e1da9d0a5460","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,3,111,251,234,253,144,220,64,102,143,227,88,24,225,218,157,10,84,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
