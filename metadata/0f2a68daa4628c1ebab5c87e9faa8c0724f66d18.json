Franz (Klaus Wildbolz) is unusual for a journalist, in that he is fairly laid back and pleasant; but he does have a tendency to complain. His life is more complex than normal because of his liaisons with his wife Anna (Susanne Widl), Petra, a nurse (Christiane von Aster), Elizabeth, a barmaid (Renee Felden), and ateacher named Gertrud (Maria Martina). Two of these women are expecting a child by Franz, while all of them cater to his needs and tolerate his foibles. But Franz is heading for a wake-up call as the women slowly begin to expect more from life and from him.\n\nDirector: Valie Export\nWriter: Peter Weibel\nStars: RenÃƒÂ©e Felden, Hannes Fitz, Ika Frolik\n\nProduction Co: Valie Export Filmproduktion, Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF)\nRuntime: 132 min\nSound Mix: Mono\nColor: Black and White, Color\n\nPrinted film format: 35 mm\n\nCompressed as an .mkv file\nVideo: H264, 710Ãƒâ€”480, 30.0fps\nAudio: MP4A, 48.0kHz 16bit, 2 channels","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f2a68daa4628c1ebab5c87e9faa8c0724f66d18","amp;dn":"Menschenfrauen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f2a68daa4628c1ebab5c87e9faa8c0724f66d18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,42,104,218,164,98,140,30,186,181,200,126,159,170,140,7,36,246,109,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
