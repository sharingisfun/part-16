One of the first cinematic reflections on the horrors of the Holocaust, NIGH AND FOG (NUIT ET BROUILLARD) contrasts the stillness of the abandoned camps quiet, emtpy buildings with haunting wartime footage. With NIGHT AND FOG, Resnais investigates the cyclical nature of man's violence toward man and presents the unsettling suggestion that such horrors could come again.\n\nfrench narration, english subs. some viewers will find archival footage very disturbing.\n\n         we're happy to be spreading these releases, and happy there are people to download them.  \n         look for more from us soon :)\n\n////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nother stats: 344megs, about 30 minutes. quite good, but some people may have trouble watching it, due to the content.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc418462665124f0b0fd6c6059f6e8689365fc97","amp;dn":"Night+And+Fog+%28rare+documentary%2Fww2%29+INFOFALLOUT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc418462665124f0b0fd6c6059f6e8689365fc97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,65,132,98,102,81,36,240,176,253,108,96,89,246,232,104,147,101,252,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
