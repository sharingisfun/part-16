Colla and starring Burt Reynolds, Yul Brynner, Raquel Welch, Tom Skeritt, and Jack Weston. The screenplay was written by Evan Hunter, based on the 1968 novel of the same name that was part of the &quot;87th Precinct&quot; series he wrote under the name Ed McBain. Dave Grusin composed the film's soundtrack score.\n\nPlot\n\nDetectives Steve Carella (Reynolds), Meyer Meyer (Weston), Eileen McHenry (Welch), and Bert Kling (Skeritt) are part of the 87th Precinct's team investigating a murder-extortion racket run by a mysterious deaf man (Brynner). While attempting to investigate and prevent the murders of several high-ranking city officials, they also must keep track of the perpetrators of a string of robberies. Further complicating matters is a rash of arson attacks on homeless men.\n\nFilming\n\nThe film's opening-credits sequence was filmed in and around Charlestown's City Square station on the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority's elevated Orange Line (demolished three years later), as well as the MBTA's Red Line as it emerged from its Cambridge tunnel to cross the Longfellow Bridge en route into Boston. Other Boston filming locations included the North End, the Boston Common, and the Public Garden, where Burt Reynolds runs around disguised as a nun.\n\nCast\n  \n\nBurt Reynolds\t... \tDet.
