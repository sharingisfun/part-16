Peg O My Heart\n\n\nNow You Can Talk About Me collects mid- and late-period Smith, with the harmonica genius' '60s sides for the microscopic imprint Sotoplay sampled on the first five cuts. The remainder of the album is from a 1982 session for the Murray Brothers label with Rod Piazza behind the board, which produced the Boogie'n with George album. Also included are the previously unreleased &quot;Last Chance&quot; and a powerful instrumental slow-burner. Junior Watson shines on guitar on these tracks and Smith's tone is big, fat, rich, and full of ideas galore on tunes like &quot;Bad Start,&quot; &quot;Astatic Stomp,&quot; &quot;Sunbird,&quot; and the title track. But Smith's use of a chromatic harp will strike most blues mavens as something unique and out of the ordinary, as he tackles such standards as &quot;I Left My Heart in San Francisco&quot; and &quot;Peg o' My Heart&quot; with considerable ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lan, imparting both with a bluesy feel that Jerry Murad &amp; the Harmonicats could only envision. If you like great blues harmonica playing, you're going to love Now You Can Talk About Me. Add Smith's name to the list of all-time greats near the top with this one. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e57854a2fad5414b7ffc3a0b8750f6825d7832d","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+George+%5C%27Harmonica%5C%27+Smith+-+Now+You+Can+Talk+About+Me","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e57854a2fad5414b7ffc3a0b8750f6825d7832d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,87,133,74,47,173,84,20,183,255,195,160,184,117,15,104,37,215,131,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
