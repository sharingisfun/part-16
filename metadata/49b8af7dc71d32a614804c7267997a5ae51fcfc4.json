I say that because most people think 'Funk #49' and 'Walk Away' are JOE WALSH songs. Their loss...\n\nThis album is definately one of the best rock and roll albums ever from first note to last. 'Funk #49' leads into the playful 'Ashtonpark' to the bombast of 'Woman' and 'The Bomber'(oh, that last chord that just rings out for 15 seconds!). Then the &quot;light&quot;/ more acoustic side featuring 'Tend My Garden/ Garden Gate', 'There I Go gain', the working man's themed 'Thanks' [&quot;Yes to the man above ya/ Hope you passed the test/ Nope to the man below ya/ Leave him with the rest&quot;&gt; and closing with the sadly beautiful 'Ashes, the Rain and I'.\n\nMy only gripe is the inclusion of the extended mix of 'The Bomber' INSTEAD of the original mix. Why not add the extended mix as a bonus track?\n\nOther than that, the new remaster sounds fantastic and if you turn up you can feel Joe's guitar and Dale Peters' bass in all their sonic glory and enjoy Jim Fox's under appreciated drum work (especially on the quieter songs). Get one for the car AND one for the house.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nRides Again\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 55 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
