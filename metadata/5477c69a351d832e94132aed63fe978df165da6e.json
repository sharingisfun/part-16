Queen - News of the World:\n\n\nBrian May describes News of the World as being a &quot;rootsier&quot; album than previous Queen records, partly due to the punk scene breaking at that time, which inspired Queen to record a more &quot;back to basics&quot; rock album. News of the World is a less finely polished production than their previous offerings. The complex vocal harmonies and guitar orchestrations that are used heavily in earlier Queen albums are used much more sparingly and subtly on this album.\n\n1.  We Will Rock You (02:04)\n2.  We Are The Champions (03:03)\n3.  Sheer Heart Attack (03:29)\n4.  All Dead, All Dead (03:12)\n5.  Spread Your Wings (04:36)\n6.  Fight From The Inside (03:05)\n7.  Get Down, Make Love (03:53)\n8.
