To mark the occasion, Ron Reagan has written My Father at 100, an intimate look at the life of his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â€one of the most popular presidents in American historyÃ¢â‚¬â€told from the perspective of someone who knew Ronald Reagan better than any advisor, friend, or colleague.\n\nAs he grew up under his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s watchful gaze, he observed the very qualities that made the future president a powerful leader. Yet for all of their shared experiences of horseback rides and touch football games, there was much that Ron never knew about his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past. In My Father at 100, he sets out to understand this beloved, if often enigmatic figure, who turned his early tribulations into a stunning political career.\n\nSince his death in 2004, President Reagan has been a galvanizing force that personifies the values of an older America and represents an important era in national history. Ron Reagan traces the sources of these values in his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s early years and offers a heartfelt portrait of a man and his countryÃ¢â‚¬â€and his personal memories of the president he knew as &quot;Dad&quot;.
