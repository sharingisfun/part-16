It makes you dance and it makes you bang your head. That's what Infectious Grooves is all about.. groovin' and rockin'.\n\nThe strongest element of the album, naturally, is the incredible bass work of one Rob Trujillo. Rob shows his true colors on this album, always laying down the solid groove and occasionally stepping outside of the pocket to display incredible work with both the left and right hands. The guest guitarists on the album are all of a high level of musicianship. The title track has an incredibly sick-sounding guitar solo that is usually only heard amongst the likes of talent such as Steve Vai or John Petrucci.\n\nThe only downfall of the album is that Mike Muir has never been what I would consider a &quot;good vocalist&quot;. He is, however, very fitting to the Infectious Grooves sound. The songs are all humorous, both musically and lyrically. Muir does a great job of keeping you laughing, whether it is his classic funk &quot;Hey hey hey's&quot; or the ridiculous lyrics (&quot;You lie.. and yo breath stank.. smells just like.. a septic tank.&quot;) The skits, may I add, are amusing the first time around but the novelty quickly wears off. I was also a bit irked that the album ended with a skit track as opposed to an actual song.\n\nIf you like funk and are open to experimentation, I highly recommend this album. Being an individual who has an undying love for both funk and metal, this album is extremely appealing to me.\n\nI reiterate.. HIGHLY recommended.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Infectious Grooves - The Plague That Makes Your Booty Move\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Infectious Grooves\nAlbum................: The Plague That Makes Your Booty Move\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1991\n\nFLAC\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 64 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 266kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
