Featuring Jenny Scheinman (violin), Eyvind Kang (viola), and Hank Roberts (cello), Sign Of Life was born out of Bill's composing retreat in Vermont during the fall of 2010. The entire album was recorded, mixed, and mastered in only 3 months - the shortest gestation period ever for a Frisell recording.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2242bff40b690211eb99f0650ab499e8670fa95c","amp;dn":"Bill+Frisell+-+Sign+of+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2242bff40b690211eb99f0650ab499e8670fa95c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,66,191,244,11,105,2,17,235,153,240,101,10,180,153,232,103,15,169,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
