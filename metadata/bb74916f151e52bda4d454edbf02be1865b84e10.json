In the spotlight are such instrumental heavyweights as Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Eddie Harris, Charles Mingus, Hank Crawford, and Yusef Lateef, and on the vocal end there's fine work by Betty Carter and Mose Allison. \nYes, this album might have a tough time competing with similar collections from the Blue Note and Impulse! imprints. But then again, those labels would be hard-pressed to come up with a selection as varied as this: From the truly idiosyncratic Ellington musings of Kirk (&quot;Creole Love Call&quot;) to a taste of Aquarius age jazz by Charles Lloyd (&quot;Dreamweaver: Meditation/Dervish Dance&quot;), this 14-track disc truly runs the '60s jazz gamut.
