You can almost feel the souls screaming through the whole ride, which is that album... \n\nNaturally, the album is very good. Stylically this is pure black metal, old-schooled (i.e., not based on image or something like that, like some of mercenary &quot;gothic&quot;-looking heavy metal popular bands, but first of all based on a true SPIRIT), primitive as it may seem for a first time, but extremely beautiful in its Northern Atmosphere. Don&amp;#039;t be mistaken, REAL black-metal is NOT all &quot;screams and blast-beats&quot;; listen to this album and you will understand why. Heavy riffs are going here perfectly well with medieval pipes and acoustic guitars.\n\nDATA IMAGE: http://img155.imageshack.us/img155/1505/info01satyricondarkmedievaltim.jpg\n\nAudio Format.........: MP3\nRipper...............: CDex\nEncoder..............: LAME\nBitrate..............: 256 (CBR)\nHz...................: 44,100\nChannels.............: Stereo\nReader...............: LG Electronics CD-ROM 48x (CRD-8480C)\nSource...............: CD\n\nType.................: Music\nPlatform.............: Windows 9x/ME/2000\nCompression Format...: RAR\nImage type...........: CD Rip\n\nTitle................: Dark Medieval Times\nArtist...............: Satyricon\nAlbum................: Dark Medieval Times\nYear.................: 1993\nGenre................: Black Metal\nComment..............: Belial REX Terra COLOMBIA\nType.................: Studio\nDuration.............: 43 min 31 sec\nNumber of Songs......: 7","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:036cf887e0d37c1161e79fc20b67ebf2a4d829be","amp;dn":"SATYRICON+-+Dark+Medieval+Times+%28Black+Metal+Masterpiece%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"036cf887e0d37c1161e79fc20b67ebf2a4d829be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,108,248,135,224,211,124,17,97,231,159,194,11,103,235,242,164,216,41,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
