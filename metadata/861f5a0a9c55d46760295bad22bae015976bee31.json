Roy Thomas Baker temporarily reunited with the band and became their producer; it was three years since he co-produced their 1975 album A Night at the Opera, but this album also was the last he co-produced for the band. The album's varying musical styles were alternately praised and criticised. It reached #2 in the UK Albums Chart and #6 on the US Billboard 200, and it was subject to a viciously scathing Rolling Stone review by Dave Marsh, which included the suggestion that &quot;Queen may be the first truly fascist rock band&quot;\n\n\nTracklist:\nA1 Mustapha\nA2 Fat Bottomed Girls\nA3 Jealousy\nA4 Bicycle Race\nA5 If You Can't Beat Them\nA6 Let Me Entertain You\nB1 Dead On Time\nB2 In Only Seven Days\nB3 Dreamer's Ball\nB4 Fun It\nB5 Leaving Home Ain't Easy\nB6 Don't Stop Me Now\nB7 More Of That Jazz\n\n\n\nGeneral:\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Rock\nSource: Vinyl\nFormat : FLAC+.cue\n\nAudio\n* * * MediaInspector for Mac - Version 2.0.1, build 900\n* * * Ã‚Â©2012 by Diego Massanti\n* * * MediaInfo Lib by Jerome Martinez\n* * * Raw File Report for Queen - Jazz.flac\n\nGeneral\nComplete name : /Volumes/Flac/Queen - Jazz/Queen - Jazz.flac\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nFile size : 1.63 GiB\nDuration : 44mn 52s\nOverall bit rate : 5 186 Kbps\n\nAudio\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nDuration : 44mn 52s\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 5 186 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 192 KHz\nBit depth : 24 bits\nStream size : 1.63 GiB (100%)\nWriting library : libFLAC 1.2.1 (UTC 2007-09-17)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:861f5a0a9c55d46760295bad22bae015976bee31","amp;dn":"%281978%29+Queen+-+Jazz+%5BVinylRip+24-192%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"861f5a0a9c55d46760295bad22bae015976bee31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,31,90,10,156,85,212,103,96,41,91,173,34,186,224,21,151,107,238,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
