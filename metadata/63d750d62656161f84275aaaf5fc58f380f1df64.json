Magdalena Tulli's novels include In Red, Dreams and Stones and Moving Parts, nominated for the 2006 International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, and Flaw, shortlisted for the 2007 Nike Prize, Poland's most prestigious literary award. Tulli is also the translator of Proust and Calvino into Polish. She lives in Warsaw.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* Dreams and Stones - translated from the Polish by Bill Johnston, 87 pp.(Archipelago Books)\n\n* Flaw - translated from the Polish by Bill Johnston, 138 pp.(Archipelago Books)\n\n* In Red - translated from the Polish by Bill Johnston, 115 pp.(Archipelago Books)\n\n* Moving Parts - translated from the Polish by Bill Johnston, 108 pp.(Archipelago Books)\n\n===================================================================================\n\n* Dreams and Stones\n\nImmediately hailed as one of the most brilliant contributions to the literature of Central and Eastern Europe since the fall of communism, Dreams and Stones (Sny i kamienie) won the prestigious Koscielski Foundation Prize in Poland in 1995.\n\nPowerful imagery caught in a sinewy, architectural, elegiac prose. An inner-outer dance of cityscape with the taut emotion, terror &amp; psyche of the Ã¢â‚¬ËœhumanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Where are we? What magical zone of dream and stone? We are inhabitants of the wild, brilliant imagination of Magdalena Tulli. This book is a great pleasure to read: deeply provocative, intuitive, haunting. Ã¢â‚¬ËœI hunt among stonesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was Charles OlsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s probing line, a mission manifested here with full beauty &amp; finesse. And rendered from Polish to English in an inspired translation by Bill Johnston.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ Anne Waldman\n \nA beautifully flowing translation. Johnston aptly captures the dreamy as well as the stark quality of the original.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ Danuta Borchardt\n\n\n* Flaw\n\nA single streetcar line runs around the sleepy suburban square of an unnamed city. One dayÃ¢â‚¬â€out of nowhereÃ¢â‚¬â€a group of hapless refugees pour from the streetcar and set up camp in the square. The residents grow hostile to the disruption and chaos, and eventually take extreme action. Flaw is TulliÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most personally motivated work yet, while still retaining the signature mind- and word-play that has made critics and her growing readership alike marvel.\n\nDescartes famously entertained the suspicion that the whole of reality was nothing but a devilish imposition upon our imaginations, and in Flaw, Magdalena Tulli, an extraordinary Polish writer who is as much cosmologist as novelist, has fashioned a theater of reality that DescartesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ devil might have dreamed up, a world of sinister politics and slapstick metaphysics, crowded with lonely hearts, refugees, and riot police. The book is coolly charming, funny, and heartbreaking. Even the devil should weep.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ Edwin Frank\n\nThe originality of TulliÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writing is not lessened by representing a family tree that includes Michaux, Kafka, Calvino, and Saramago.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ W.S. Merwin\n\nEach successive book of TulliÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, from Dreams and Stones to Flaw, not only demonstrates the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s consummate talent, but also ever more clearly defines the independence of her artistic vision. Far from being some reiteration of the avant-garde, Tulli's writing is something enchantingly different from the Polish prose of today and of earlier times.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ Tygodnik Powszechny\n\n\n* In Red\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Powerful imagery caught in a sinewy, architectural, elegiac prose. An inner-outer dance of cityscape with the taut emotion, terror &amp; psyche of the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœhuman.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Where are we? What magical zone of dream and stone?

And rendered from Polish to English in an inspired translation by Bill Johnston.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ Anne Waldman\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Tulli strings together stories with compelling logic . . . Her evocation of a town where everything beautiful is tainted with death never feels far removed from reality.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€The New Yorker\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“There is much to treasure. Tulli plays with the line between unexpected and quirky very well. . . . You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help but to want to return again and again.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€NPR\n\n\n* Moving Parts\n\n Ã¢â‚¬Å“Magdalena TulliÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s taut novel follows a daring path through the maze of recent European history Ã¢â‚¬â€from its whimsical postmodern opening to a far more complex inquiry into the enduring legacy of World War II and the nature of human destiny itself. A genuine tour de force that grows more fascinating with each surprising turn.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Lynne Sharon Schwartz\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Just when you fear fiction may have no more turns left to take, along comes Magdalena Tulli. Picking up on the experiments of Oulipo and Robbe-Grillet, she leads us into a dazzling maze out of which we emerge with our wonder and our delight retooled.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ Askold Melnyczuk\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“TulliÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s snapshot vignettesÃ¢â‚¬â€of trains covered with Ã¢â‚¬Ëœbright zigzags of graffiti,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœa fur that gives off the oppressive smell of mothballs,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ of a hobo who Ã¢â‚¬Ëœrakes cigarettes out of his hairÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬â€can be read as lapidary, Cubist poetry or a word collage thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s amorphously if resonatingly evocative.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ Kirkus Reviews\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://quarterlyconversation.com/in-red-by-magdalena-tulli&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://quarterlyconversation.com/in-red-by-magdalena-tulli&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://archipelagobooks.org/product/magdelena-tulli-author-bundle/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://archipelagobooks.org/product/magdelena-tulli-author-bundle/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63d750d62656161f84275aaaf5fc58f380f1df64","amp;dn":"Magdalena+Tulli+-+Polish+Author+%284+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63d750d62656161f84275aaaf5fc58f380f1df64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,215,80,214,38,86,22,31,132,39,90,170,245,252,88,243,128,241,223,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
