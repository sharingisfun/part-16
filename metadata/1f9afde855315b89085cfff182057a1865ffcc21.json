Unfortunately, quitting his company proves even more hazardous than remaining his pupil when she is afflicted with a terrible curse. Yet salvation may lie in a mysterious tome her tutor has hidden somewhere on the war-torn continent.\n\nShe sets out on a seemingly impossible journey to find the book, never suspecting her fate is tied to three strangers: the artist Niklaus Manuel Deutsch, the alchemist Dr. Paracelsus, and a gun-slinging Dutch mercenary. As Manuel paints her macabre story on canvas, plank, and church wall, the young apprentice becomes increasingly aware that death might be the least of her concerns","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f9afde855315b89085cfff182057a1865ffcc21","amp;dn":"The+Enterprise+of+Death+by+Jesse+Bullington+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f9afde855315b89085cfff182057a1865ffcc21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,154,253,232,85,49,91,137,8,92,255,241,130,5,122,24,101,255,204,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
