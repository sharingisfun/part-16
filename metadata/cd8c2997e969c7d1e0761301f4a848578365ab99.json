Ã¢â‚¬Å“Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Naturally the new Ã¢â‚¬Å“BiblesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (including the Ã¢â‚¬Å“NewÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ King James Version) all change the verse so you will lose that key: either by not studying or not rightly dividing. If we are going to study the Bible so we can rightly divide it correctly, then we must interpret the Bible correctly. Now Peter said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“no prophecy of the scripture is of any PRIVATE interpretationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (2 Pet. 1:20). That means if you are going to get the correct interpretation of any given passage of Scripture, you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go to any man or church to get it. In the Scriptures, the Interpreter of Scripture is the Author Himself: God, specifically God the Holy Spirit (2 Pet. 1:21). God is the Interpreter of the Scriptures; not any Pope, Cardinal, Bishop, Priest, professor, pastor, Rabbi, or Greek or Hebrew scholar. The guiding principle of the Reformation was Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sola ScripturaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½: the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Scriptures alone.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t interpret the Scriptures by Catholic teachings or traditions, or by the dictates of the Popes, Cardinals, and Bishops. You interpret the Scriptures by the Scriptures. Now there are certain Ã¢â‚¬Å“lawsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“principlesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that guide the student of the Scriptures in correct interpretation. These are not the Ã¢â‚¬Å“divine fiatsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of any church or school but practical principles gained from studying what the Scriptures say. Every Christian should be familiar with them.\n\nDr. Peter S. Ruckman received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Alabama and finished his formal education with six years of training at Bob Jones University (four full years and two accelerated summer sessions), completing requirements for the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degree.\nReading at a rate of seven hundred words per minute, Dr. Ruckman had managed to read about 6,500 books before receiving his doctorate, and he still reads an average of a book each day.\nDr. Ruckman stands for the absolute authority of the Authorized Version and offers no apology to any recognized scholar anywhere for his stand. In addition to preaching the gospel and teaching the Bible, Dr. Ruckman has produced a comprehensive collection of apologetic and polemic literature and resources supporting the authority of the Authorized Version of the Holy Scriptures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd8c2997e969c7d1e0761301f4a848578365ab99","amp;dn":"How+to+Interpret+The+Bible+-+Dr.+Peter+S.+Ruckman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd8c2997e969c7d1e0761301f4a848578365ab99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,140,41,151,233,105,199,209,224,118,19,1,244,168,72,87,131,101,171,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
