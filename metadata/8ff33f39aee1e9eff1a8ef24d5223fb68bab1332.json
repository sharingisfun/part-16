The pictures are from private collections, and not one of them is familiar. All of old Russia appears to be represented here, from the factory towns around Moscow to Siberian villages and the bazaars of the Caucasus. Mr. FitzLyon, who is Russian-born, sketches in the background to all this, and he has some interesting things to say about the founding of the Moscow Art Theater, about the fierce ferment in the arts in pre-Revolutionary Russia, and about the astonishingly rapid pace of Russian industrialization before the 1914-1918 war. This is an eloquent gallery of pictures","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ff33f39aee1e9eff1a8ef24d5223fb68bab1332","amp;dn":"Before+the+Revolution%3A+Russia+and+its+People+Under+the+Czar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ff33f39aee1e9eff1a8ef24d5223fb68bab1332","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,243,63,57,174,225,233,239,241,168,239,36,213,34,63,182,139,171,19,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
