A place where the most advanced and skilled Heroes in the universe are built to serve one function - saving the world from evil. Rookie Rocka responds to a distress signal sent by a civilian, Aldous Witch, who has crash-landed on a protected planet. When Rocka goes missing, Stormer, Furno, Nex, Bulk and Stringer are sent to find him. They discover that Aldous Witch has transformed into the sinister Witch Doctor and has turned a once beautiful planet into a savage wasteland that is now set on destroying itself and everything on it... including our Heroes.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77c3f895a956cb26071c3f4d557ffd0bf0cd3b7f","amp;dn":"Lego+Hero+Factory+Savage+Planet+DVDRiP+x.264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77c3f895a956cb26071c3f4d557ffd0bf0cd3b7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,195,248,149,169,86,203,38,7,28,63,77,85,127,253,11,240,205,59,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
