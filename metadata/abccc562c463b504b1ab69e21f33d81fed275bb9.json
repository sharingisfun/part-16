She cast a spell on millions more viewers as Sabrina, the Teenage Witch. Now, in Melissa Explains It All, Melissa tells the frank and funny behind-the-scenes stories from her extraordinary past and her refreshingly normal present.\n\nMelissa has been entertaining audiences most of her life; when there were no girls named Melissa on her favorite show, the forceful four year old decided sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d get on TV her way. From that moment on, Melissa has shown a singular determination and focusÃ¢â‚¬â€whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s for booking three national commercials so her dad would build her a tree house or for nailing the audition for Clarissa.\n\nFrom her first commercial to her current starring role in ABC FamilyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hit Melissa and Joey, Hart never let fame go to her head. She always had one foot in Hollywood and one foot in realityÃ¢â‚¬â€and still does.
