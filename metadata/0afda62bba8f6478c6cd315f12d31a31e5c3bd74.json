Those who survived are called hibakusha--people exposed to the bomb--and there are an estimated 200,000 living today. Today, with the threat of nuclear weapons of mass destruction frighteningly real- the worlds arsenal capable of repeating the destruction at Hiroshima 400,000 times over, Oscar award-winning filmmaker Steven Okazaki revisits the bombings and shares the stories of the only people to have survived a nuclear attack.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0afda62bba8f6478c6cd315f12d31a31e5c3bd74","amp;dn":"White+Light+Black+Rain+2007+DVDRip+XviD-VoMiT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0afda62bba8f6478c6cd315f12d31a31e5c3bd74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,253,166,43,186,143,100,120,198,205,49,95,18,211,26,49,229,195,189,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
