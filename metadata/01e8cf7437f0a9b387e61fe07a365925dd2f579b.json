They met at Greenville College in Greenville, Illinois. [1]\n\nJars of Clay consists of Dan Haseltine on vocals, Charlie Lowell on piano and keyboards, Stephen Mason on lead guitars and Matthew Odmark on rhythm guitars. Although the band has no permanent drummer or bassist, Jeremy Lutito and Gabe Ruschival of Disappointed By Candy fill these roles for live concerts. Past tour band members include Aaron Sands, Scott Savage, and Joe Porter. Jars of Clay's style is a blend of alternative rock, folk, acoustic, and R&amp;B.\n\nThe band's name is derived from the New International Version's translation of 2 Corinthians 4:7:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBut we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThis verse is paraphrased in their song &quot;Four Seven,&quot; which appears on Frail and as a hidden track on the CD release of their self-titled album.\n\n\n\n\n\nJars of Clay \n\n\n\nJars of Clay is the eponymous first full-length album by Christian folk/alternative rock group Jars of Clay. It was released on October 24, 1995 by Essential Records. The album has been highly acclaimed, being one of few Christian albums of the mid-nineties to achieve platinum status. As the group's debut album, Jars of Clay introduced many internationally to the group and established the group due to their distinctive style.\n\nJars of Clay's eponymous first full-length album is characterized by a combination of drum loops and acoustic guitar strumming that would become an early trademark of the band. Strings are also used prominently in several songs, most notably &quot;Blind&quot; and the album's secret track &quot;Four Seven&quot;.\n\nThe album was mostly self-produced, with the exception of &quot;Liquid&quot; and &quot;Flood&quot; which were produced by former King Crimson guitarist Adrian Belew.\n\nSeveral tracks from this album were hits on Christian radio, and as a result they have been staples of the band's live concerts ever since. The song &quot;Flood&quot; became an unexpected hit on mainstream radio as well, resulting in a brief period of mainstream rock popularity for the band during which they toured with artists such as Sting, The Samples and Matchbox Twenty, and were included in several movie soundtracks.\n\nMost of this album consists of reworked versions of songs from the band's demo, Frail, which was recorded as a class project during their senior year of college. The song &quot;He&quot; appears to be almost identical to the original recording.\n\nThe songs &quot;Sinking&quot;, &quot;Flood&quot;, &quot;Worlds Apart&quot;, and &quot;Blind&quot; were all unique to this release, as all other tracks had previously been released on the group's debut demo album Frail, and two songs from the demo did not make it to this album - &quot;Fade to Grey&quot; and EP's title track &quot;Frail&quot;, though these were both later included on the group's follow-up, Much Afraid, which also introduced lyrics into the previously instrumental piece &quot;Frail&quot;.\n\nNotably, Jars of Clay is considered to be a landmark album in Christian rock, even though very few electric guitars are used, leading some to categorize Jars of Clay as folk-rock, alternative folk, or even pop instead.\n\nThe album was listed at #22 in the 2001 book, CCM Presents: The 100 Greatest Albums in Christian Music.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Liquid&quot; - 3:32 \n2.\t&quot;Sinking&quot; - 3:47 \n3.\t&quot;Love Song for a Savior&quot; - 4:46 \n4.\t&quot;Like a Child&quot; - 4:35 \n5.\t&quot;Art In Me&quot; - 3:58 \n6.\t&quot;He&quot; - 5:19 \n7.\t&quot;Boy on a String&quot; - 3:31 \n8.\t&quot;Flood&quot; - 3:31 \n9.\t&quot;Worlds Apart&quot; - 5:18 \n10.\t&quot;Blind&quot; - 3:59 \n\t&quot;Four Seven&quot; (hidden track) - 2:38 \n\tInterlude and Studio Session (hidden track) - 20:38\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01e8cf7437f0a9b387e61fe07a365925dd2f579b","amp;dn":"Jars+of+Clay+-+Self+titled+1995+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01e8cf7437f0a9b387e61fe07a365925dd2f579b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,232,207,116,55,240,169,179,135,230,31,224,122,54,89,37,221,47,87,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
