Or have you seen a file with the extension .rar, .zip, .7zip, .gzip and wondered what it was? Well here's a little explanation. Compression of computer files is no secret and it's been around for many years. It's a way to gather many files together, convert them all into the one single file and squeeze out any unnecessary space. Depending on what file type you're trying to compress, your overall file size can reduce dramatically. When you require files contained within a single compressed file, you simply use a program such as WinRAR to extract all files. The extracted files remain unharmed and ready to use as normal.\n\nSo why would you want to compress files? File compression has many uses. Sending emails with large attachments can result in the sender or the receiver not being able to download or even read the email. Often, email servers have a file size limit too. Using a file compressing program such as WinRAR can help this problem. A series of files equating to 10Mb, could even be reduced to as little as 4Mb, depending on the file format.\n\nFaster computers can also result from using programs such as WinRAR. There's many factors that contribute to the speed of your PC. One of the little known facts is that the storage capacity of your computer also has an impact on how fast it processes. In other words, the more space you have, the better. Compressing large quantities of unused files is a great way to save space and store your files. What's more, you can also compress large quantities of non-frequently used files and store them on an external hard drive or DVD for later use.\n\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.- Install the program according to your system: x32 or x64. When the installation is finished close the program completely.\n\n2.- Open the file &quot;Medicine-Keygen&quot;, inside you will find two files that give you two different options for activation of the product:\n- &quot;keygen-CORE.exe&quot; This is a keygen, in the option &quot;Name&quot; put your name, in the option &quot;Type&quot; choose the option &quot;Single PC usage license&quot;, then you click on &quot;Install License&quot;. and ready!\n- &quot;rarreg.key&quot; This is a log file, copy it and paste it into the directory where you installed the program: on windows Vista/7/8 is in &quot;C:  Program Files  WinRAR &quot;.\n\neither of the two options are valid.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:759fc005d9e6b0bca77ab37d9e24ea3bc7d59a87","amp;dn":"WinRAR+5.00+Beta+6+%5BEsp.%26amp%3B.Eng%5D-x32.%26amp%3B.x64+%2Bkeygen%2Breg.fil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"759fc005d9e6b0bca77ab37d9e24ea3bc7d59a87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,159,192,5,217,230,176,188,167,122,179,125,158,36,234,59,199,213,154,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
