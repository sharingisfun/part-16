Besides that, I have not done anything to change it. You need to have your own XP Pro SP2 key at the GUI setup. But, if you have a DELL PC, you don't have to enter a key, lucky you. After searching for hours trying to find a premade USB XP Pro, I did not find anything, so, I found my old SP2 XP Pro DELL disk, and edited files so it could do this, tested it on a 4GB SanDisk Cruzer.\nTested Computers:\nSanDisk Cruzer 4GB\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n|Gateway NV5378u    - Yes|\n|Dell Inspiron 600m - Yes|\n|Dell XPS m140      - Yes|\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nInstallation Instructions:\n1.) Download this torrent\n2.) Plug in your USB flash drive and format it with the HP Format tool in NTFS format (Extras folder)\n3.) Burn the sp2_pro_rtm_usb.iso with ImgBurn (in the Extras folder)\n4.) Go to a pc (Take out the normal hard drive if possible, this may screw up your MBR bootloader)\n5.) Unplug all USB devices except for your USB Keyboard and Mouse (if you have one) and the drive without a hub\n6.) Select your flash drive and tell it you want it to leave file system intact (if you get the thing saying you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t install it, make sure you format the flash drive appropriately and clear any MBR)\n7.) Let the flash drive boot up and finish the install\n8.) If it asks if you want to install USB drivers, click YES every time.\n9.) When install completes, you can plug in all your hard drives and such back in to the PC\n\n\n~~~~Troubleshooting~~~~\nAlright, I tried to make this as simple as possible.\n1.) If you get the cant install thing in the text mode setup, format the USB drive again in the HP format tool and try again. If it still fails, try a different USB flash drive, eSATA, or an External USB hard drive.\n2.) If you did not click yes on a driver install, you fucked up. You need to reinstall and click YES to EVERYTHING.\n3.) If you get stop error 0x000007B this normally indicates a boot failure. Restart the PC and press F8 to select safe mode and normally it will boot up. I had to install video drivers and network drivers n the Gateway NV53 to get rid of this.\n4.) If you can't even boot from the USB flash drive, in your BIOS (Del, F2, F10, F12, etc...) and check your boot devices.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Hopefully, I provided everything you need to know to get a portable XP!\nPlease note that I am NOT responsible for anything that happens to your computer.
