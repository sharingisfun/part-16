This highly readable critical celebration of the life and times of Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha looks at the series as a new departure for television. It discusses the show's position in an increasingly complex television landscape, and pioneers innovative approaches to the study of contemporary television culture. The book explores, among many other issues, female fandom and fan culture; fashion and fashion journalism; male archetypes and the search for Mr. Right; third wave feminism; and of course, sex and the single girl. The book includes a full episode guide, reports from the Sex and the City Manhattan tour and a map of Sex and the City New York.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed0ec9a5aee905c64b5cb81a6242a50d9ac1db82","amp;dn":"Reading+Sex+and+the+City","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed0ec9a5aee905c64b5cb81a6242a50d9ac1db82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,14,201,165,174,233,5,198,75,92,184,26,98,66,165,13,154,193,219,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
