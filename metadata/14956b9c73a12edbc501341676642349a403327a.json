Each interview is based on a simple question, concerning historical evidence (for example, &quot;Can the Biographies of Jesus Be Trusted?&quot;), scientific evidence, (&quot;Does Archaeology Confirm or Contradict Jesus' Biographies?&quot;), and &quot;psychiatric evidence&quot; (&quot;Was Jesus Crazy When He Claimed to Be the Son of God?&quot;). Together, these interviews compose a case brief defending Jesus' divinity, and urging readers to reach a verdict of their own.\n\n\nThis book is countered by The Jesus Puzzle which I have already uploaded.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14956b9c73a12edbc501341676642349a403327a","amp;dn":"The+Case+for+Christ+-+Lee+Strobel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14956b9c73a12edbc501341676642349a403327a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,149,107,156,115,161,46,219,197,1,52,22,118,100,35,73,164,3,50,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
