It was released on October 26, 1999 on Columbia Records.\nThe set consists of 48 songs, including rarities, previously unreleased demos and mixes by the band, and previously released material from their albums Facelift, Sap, Dirt, Jar of Flies, Alice in Chains and Unplugged and a CD-ROM containing various multimedia. In 1998, vocalist Layne Staley reunited with Alice in Chains to record two new songs, &quot;Get Born Again&quot; and &quot;Died&quot;. Originally written for Cantrell's solo album, the songs were released on Music Bank.&quot;\n\nI found this torrent on demonoid, and wanted to share it here because the other torrent here has no seeders and screwed everyone that tried it. :/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18bd53f753f369e027d5326bba6deb7cbd0c143b","amp;dn":"Alice+in+Chains+Music+Bank+flac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18bd53f753f369e027d5326bba6deb7cbd0c143b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,189,83,247,83,243,105,224,39,213,50,107,186,109,235,124,189,12,20,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
