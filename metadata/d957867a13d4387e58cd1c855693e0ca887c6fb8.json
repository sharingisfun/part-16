Now, in the sequel, Madison is back on Earth, stranded there on Halloween, facing the prospect of spending an entire year as (shudder) a ghost among the living. Although not quite as entertaining as DamnedÃ¢â‚¬â€primarily because it lacks the first bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hellish travelogueÃ¢â‚¬â€the novel nicely continues MadisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story, filling in a lot of the blanks in her life (we find out, for example, the real reason why sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been damned) and exposing an ancient satanic plot thatÃ¢â‚¬â€believe it or notÃ¢â‚¬â€has poor little Madison at its center. As with the first book, this one lives or dies on the appeal of its teenage narrator. On the face of it, Spencer isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the most likable of girls: sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s self-centered, in-your-face, and almost too aggressively clever for her own goodÃ¢â‚¬â€but so was Holden Caulfield. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a compelling character, and she drives a novel that will resonate from the get-go with PalahniukÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s many fans.
