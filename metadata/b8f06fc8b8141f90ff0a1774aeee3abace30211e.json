Though initially considered a work of pornography, the book has come to be considered an aptly titled philosophical drama.\n\nPlot\n\nIn the introduction, the Marquis de Sade exhorts his readers to indulge in the various activities in the play. He says that the work is dedicated to &quot;voluptuaries of all ages, of every sex&quot; and urges readers to emulate the characters. &quot;Lewd women&quot;, he writes, &quot;let the voluptuous Saint-Ange be your model; after her example, be heedless of all that contradicts pleasure's divine laws, by which all her life she was enchained.&quot; He then urges &quot;young maidens&quot; to copy EugÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nie; &quot;be as quick as she to destroy, to spurn all those ridiculous precepts inculcated in you by imbecile parents.&quot; Finally, he urges male readers to &quot;study the cynical DolmancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©&quot; and follow his example of selfishness and consideration for nothing but his own enjoyment.\n\nDolmancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© is the most dominant of the characters in the dialogue. He explains to EugÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nie that morality, compassion, religion and modesty are all absurd notions that stand in the way of the sole aim of human existence: pleasure. Like most of Sade's work, &quot;Philosophy In The Bedroom&quot; features a great deal of sex as well as libertine philosophies. Although there is some torture, the dialogue contains no actual murder, unlike many of Sade's works.\n\nDolmancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© and Madame de Saint-Ange start off by giving EugÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nie their own brand of sex education, explaining the biological facts and declaring that physical pleasure is a far more important motive for sex than that of reproduction. Then they eagerly get down to the practical lessons, with Le Chevalier joining them in the fourth act and swiftly helping to take away EugÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nie's virginity.\n\nEugÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nie is instructed on the pleasures of various sexual practices and she proves to be a fast learner. As is usually the case in Sade's work, the characters are all bisexual, and sodomy is the preferred activity of all concerned, especially DolmancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, who prefers male sexual partners and will not have anything other than anal intercourse with females. Madame de Saint-Ange and her younger brother Le Chevalier also have sex with one another, and boast of doing so on a regular basis. Their incest - and all manner of other sexual activity and taboos, such as sodomy, adultery, and homosexuality - are justified by DolmancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© in a series of energetic arguments that ultimately boil down to if it feels good, do it. (Sodomy was illegal and punishable by death in France at the time the dialogue was written, and Sade himself was convicted of sodomy in 1772.)\n\nThe corruption of EugÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nie is actually at the request of her father, who has sent her to Madame de Saint-Ange for the very purpose of having his daughter stripped of the morality her virtuous mother taught her.\n\nThe dialogue is split into seven parts, or 'dialogues,'and was originally illustrated by Sade himself. There is a lengthy section within the fifth dialogue titled &quot;Yet Another Effort, Frenchmen, If You Would Become Republicans&quot; in which it is argued that, having done away with the monarchy in the French Revolution, the people of France should take the final step towards liberty by abolishing religion too.\n\nIn the final act, EugÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nie's mother, Madame de Mistival, arrives to rescue her daughter from the &quot;monsters&quot; who have corrupted her. EugÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nie's father, however, warns his daughter and friends in advance and urges them to punish his wife, whose person and virtue he clearly loathes. Madame de Mistival is horrified to find that not only did her husband arrange for their daughter's corruption, but EugÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nie has already lost any moral standards she previously possessed, along with any respect or obedience towards her mother. EugÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nie refuses to leave and Madame de Mistival is soon stripped, beaten, whipped and raped, her daughter taking an active part in this brutality and even declaring her wish to kill her mother. DolmancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© eventually calls in for a servant who has syphilis to rape EugÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nie's mother. EugÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nie sews up her vagina and DolmancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© her anus to keep the polluted seed inside and she is then sent home in tears, knowing her daughter has been lost to the libertine and corrupt mentality of DolmancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© and his accomplices.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8f06fc8b8141f90ff0a1774aeee3abace30211e","amp;dn":"Marquis+De+Sade+-+Philosophy+In+The+Bedroom+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8f06fc8b8141f90ff0a1774aeee3abace30211e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,240,111,200,184,20,31,144,255,10,23,116,174,238,58,186,206,48,33,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
