The teleplay by Sally Robinson is adapted from the book of the 1957 stage musical by Meredith Willson, which was based on a story by Willson and Franklin Lacey.\n\nThe television production, which was broadcast by ABC on the February 16, 2003 edition of The Wonderful World of Disney, is a remake of the 1962 feature film.\n\nThe three-hour presentation was watched by 13.1 million viewers, with a 3.8 rating/9 share in adults aged 18-49. It finished second in the first two hours and fourth in the final hour.\n\nProfessor Harold Hill, a con artist who makes a living by selling instruments and uniforms to aspiring musicians he fails to teach once they are delivered, sets his sights on the naive citizens of River City, Iowa as his latest targets. With the assistance of former sidekick Marcellus Washburn, who now is living in the rural town, Harold convinces the residents their only hope of saving their sons from the corruption of the local pool hall is to allow him to create a marching band and help them develop their musical talents.\n\nSuspicious of Harold's claim that he has a musical degree from the &quot;Gary Conservatory of Music,&quot; prim and proper town librarian and piano teacher Marian Paroo begins to investigate his background, much to the dismay of her mother, who hopes by participating in the band, Marian's younger brother Wintrop will overcome the shyness he suffers as the result of a pronounced lisp. Marian tries to enlist the aid of Mayor Shinn, whose wife Eulalie and her friends always have looked askance at Marian due to her relationship with a man who left the library building to the town but all its contents to Marian. Mayor Shinn appoints four city councilmen to look into Harold's past, but they fall under his spell when he encourages them to emulate a barbershop quartet and never quite manage to see his alleged credentials. By the time Marian uncovers the truth about Harold, she has fallen in love with the shyster and he in turn - much to his surprise - feels the same way about her.\n\nCast\n\n    * Matthew Broderick .....
