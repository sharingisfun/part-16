Chasing loose threads that she hopes will lead to the truth, Jo sets off on an unlikely quest across boundaries of language and religion, through chasms of sectarian divides in the Muslim world. Against the backdrop of the War on TerrorÃ¢â‚¬â€travelling from California to Chicago, Pakistan to IraqÃ¢â‚¬â€she delves deeply into the past, encountering relatives, often for the first time, whose histories are intricately intertwined with her own . . . only to learn that true spiritual devotion is a broken field riddled with doubt and that nothing is ever as it seems.\n\nA story of forbidden love and familial dysfunction that interweaves multiple generational and cultural viewpoints, The Sweetness of Tears is a powerful reminder of the ties that bind us, the choices that divide us, and the universal joys and tragedies that shape us all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7df9bbc84f9d43795dc1e45ef3fdf9f8e687e5ee","amp;dn":"The+Sweetness+of+Tears+-+Nafisa+Haji.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7df9bbc84f9d43795dc1e45ef3fdf9f8e687e5ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,249,187,200,79,157,67,121,93,193,228,94,243,253,249,248,230,135,229,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
