The goal is not to kill as many monsters, is to survive.\nThe dynamics of the game is different from what we are used to in terms of games with zombies. Instead of having a military arsenal to destroy the monsters in DayZ you count only your instincts. You can find weapons during the adventure, but they are few. Inside the amazing island of 225 km Ã‚Â² you will need to run, hide, feed and pay attention to every comma to not die.\nThe change was so popular among the players who turned out to be a full game, which should hit the market later this year. During the adventure you can build bomb shelters and other items to help in the task of surviving. Also you can create hunting dogs to accompany you on the journey.\n\nScreen:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/133000/1-1-132823.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/133000/1-1-132823.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/133000/1-2-132825.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/133000/1-2-132825.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/133000/1-3-132826.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/133000/1-3-132826.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/133000/1-4-132827.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/133000/1-4-132827.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/133000/1-5-132828.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/133000/1-5-132828.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/133000/1-6-132829.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/133000/1-6-132829.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e26bbdd62d8ebc7902aea95807c18ae744a655b","amp;dn":"DayZ+1.7.6.1+FULL+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e26bbdd62d8ebc7902aea95807c18ae744a655b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,38,187,221,98,216,235,199,144,42,234,149,128,124,24,174,116,74,101,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
