It introduces the reader to the five dimensions that provide a comprehensive view of theology: biblical, systematic, historical, dogmatic and contemporary.\n\nThe apostle Paul wrote that all Scripture is 'profitable for teaching' (2 Tim. 3:16), that Timothy should 'pay close attention to...your teaching' (1 Tim. 4:16), and that leaders should 'be able both to exhort in sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict' (Titus 1:9). When he wrote these statements, Paul was referring to theology.\n\nBeyond giving basic definitions and general descriptions, author Paul Enns summarized the substantial features of theology. In this way, he provides a concise doctrinal reference tool for the newcomer as well as the seasoned scholar seeking a refresher. There are fifty-five informative charts located at strategic points throughout the book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d03d5724241588f6d9b44fe7b1bfbc00fc627e41","amp;dn":"The+Moody+Handbook+of+Theology-+P+Enns%282014%29pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d03d5724241588f6d9b44fe7b1bfbc00fc627e41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,61,87,36,36,21,136,246,217,180,79,231,177,191,188,0,252,98,126,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
