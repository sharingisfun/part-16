The album was released on November 20, 2007 by Interscope Records. The album was recorded between 2004 and 2006 and it was produced by Greg Wells, with two songs produced by singer Ryan Tedder, and was engineered and mixed by Joe Zook. The album follows two years of massive success on MySpace where the band has appeared in MySpace Music's Top Artists since early 2006, with over 28 million total song plays counted. The album was released after the success of a remix version of the lead single &quot;Apologize&quot;, which was produced by Timbaland. The song reached number one in many countries, while it peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The following single &quot;Stop and Stare&quot; was also a success, while &quot;Say (All I Need)&quot;, &quot;Mercy&quot; and &quot;Come Home&quot; were also released as singles.\n\nIf you like it go buy it.
