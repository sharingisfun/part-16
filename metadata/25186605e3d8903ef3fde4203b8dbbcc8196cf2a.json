Legend has it an immortal monster, supposedly an ancient ancestor of the Hammonds, roams the land surrounding their vast estate, murdering anyone foolish enough to wander out on a chilly, moon-lit night. Helga Hammond (Heather Angel) is convinced this curse is a myth, and when her brother, Oliver (John Howard) and a neighbor girl named Kate O'Malley (Virginia Traxler) are attacked one evening by an unknown assailant, she goes straight to the authorities. Enlisting the help of Robert Curtis (James Ellison), a scientist working for Scotland Yard, Helga hopes to prove there was nothing supernatural about the attacks, yet as both she and Mr. Curtis will soon discover, there are things even science can't explain. \n\nGeneral           : The.Undying.Monster.1942.DVDRip.x264.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 252 Kbps\nLength            : 1 019 MiB for 1h 3mn 16s 800ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 2 050 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 480 (1.333) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #2           : VobSub\nLanguage          : fr\n\nText #3           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : pt\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035489/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035489/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: English, Spanish, French, Portuguese\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25186605e3d8903ef3fde4203b8dbbcc8196cf2a","amp;dn":"The.Undying.Monster.1942.DVDRip.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25186605e3d8903ef3fde4203b8dbbcc8196cf2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,24,102,5,227,216,144,62,243,253,228,32,59,141,187,204,129,150,207,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
