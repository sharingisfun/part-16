From pop star to reggae radical, musical entrepreneur to the inventor of ringbang, the artist has cut a swath through the world of music and made it his own.\n\nEddy Grant&amp;#039;s groundbreaking and innovative fusion of R&amp;B, Rock, Reggae and African rhythms made for some truly unique music--the best of which is anthologized here. Although most of Eddy&amp;#039;s original CDs are currently unavailable this CD gives you some of his best tracks while proving just what a musical visionary he was.\n\nThe big hits are there &amp;#039;Electric Avenue&amp;#039; UK#2, &amp;#039;I Don&amp;#039;t Wanna Dance&amp;#039; #1, &amp;#039;Living On The Frontline&amp;#039; #11, &amp;#039;Do You Feel My Love?&amp;#039; #8, &amp;#039;Can&amp;#039;t Get Enough Of You&amp;#039; #13 and &amp;#039;Gimme Hope Jo&amp;#039;anna&amp;#039; #7, the funk-flying &amp;#039;Walking On Sunshine&amp;#039; which was a modest US R&amp;B hit\n\n\n\nP.S. : The tracklist on back cover and on cd is wrong!
