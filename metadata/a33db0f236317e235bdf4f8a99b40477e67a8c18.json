Beyond simply obeying laws, this book focuses on leading an aggressively dynamic life, giving examples of proper and improper attitudes, conduct, and characteristics in succinct, penetrating ways. A proverb can be thought of as ''a short sentence from long experience''; it is easy to remember, yet it condenses much wisdom into a small space.\n\n''All Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable'' in four ways: for doctrine - whats right; for reproof - whats not right; for correction - how to get right; and for instruction in righteousness - how to stay right (2 Timothy 3:16). This book touches on all four of these.\n\nThis study contains 8 hours of verse by verse teachings\n\n\nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long.\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long. (I have 4 year old active seeds out there, must be working for some folks!)\n\nEphesians 5:11\n11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.\n\n                                             \n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n\n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a33db0f236317e235bdf4f8a99b40477e67a8c18","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Chuck+Missler+-+The+Book+of+Proverbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a33db0f236317e235bdf4f8a99b40477e67a8c18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,61,176,242,54,49,126,35,91,223,79,138,153,180,4,119,230,122,140,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
