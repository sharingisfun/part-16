In this book, Kepa Korta and John Perry explain why critical pragmatics provides a coherent picture of how parts of language study fit together within the broader picture of human thought and action. They focus on issues about singular reference, that is, talk about particular things, places or people, which have played a central role in the philosophy of language for more than a century. They argue that attention to the 'reflexive' or 'utterance-bound' contents of utterances sheds new light on these old problems. Their important study proposes a new approach to pragmatics and should be of wide interest to philosophers of language and linguists.\n\n\nPaperback: 192 pages\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press (September 26, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0521748674\nISBN-13: 978-0521748674","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:089138ea6ab8c2e96b0d4e465fad4f2904b25bee","amp;dn":"Critical+Pragmatics+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"089138ea6ab8c2e96b0d4e465fad4f2904b25bee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,145,56,234,106,184,194,233,107,13,78,70,95,173,79,41,4,178,91,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
