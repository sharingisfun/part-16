The package contains no less than four versions of the most successful Turboprop family: Cheyenne II, I, IA and IIXL.\n\nAll four aircraft have been rebuilt and animated for the Flight simulator in 3-D fashion right down to the smallest of details. In this way mechanical parts such as ailerons, rudders, flaps, engines and even windscreen wipers move just like in the original aircraft.\n\nThe excellent graphics of both the 2D- and 3D-Cockpits are equipped with all the avionic instruments usually to be found inside these models and the precise flight dynamics have been developed with the help of real Cheyenne pilots. Besides the accurate panels for the pilot and the co-pilot, the cabin of the Cheyenne has also been rebuilt to the highest level of detail with its opening doors for the passengers and the freight.\n\nThe sounds, which are being used, have all been recorded on the real thing. Numerous liveries for all the available versions and an extensive documentation round of a superb simulation for both VFR and IFR pilots.\n\nThe completely renewed FSX version of the Digital Aviaton Piper Cheyene will include a new full functional weather radar.\n\nFeatures: \nHighly detailed 2D cockpit and exterior model for 4 different aircraft variants: \nCheyenne I \nCheyenne IA \nCheyenne II \nCheyenne IIXL \nFully functional virtual cockpit with very smooth gauges and controls \nEach cockpit variation represents the actual aircraft variant \nFlight dynamics have been developed with a real Cheyenne pilot \n2 different sound sets (with/without active noise reduction) \nExtensive Documentation \nExterior model \n\nExterior has been modeled in every detail fully based on the FSX standards \nSpecular lighting maps (making reflections more realistic) \nAircrafts variants differ in size, engines, door arrangement \nCheyenne I in three liveries (2x Germany, USA) \nCheyenne IA in three liveries (Germany, France, Austria) \nCheyenne II in three liveries (France, USA, Netherlands) \nCheyenne IIXL in three liveries (Spain, Great Britain, Switzerland) \nFull set of animations (control surfaces, trim tabs, doors, baggage compartments, gear, ice protection) \nAll doors can be handled separately \nExterior ground equipment, like power unit \nSystems simulation\n\nReal engine start up procedure, with starter, generators and fuel levers \nElectrical system with different bus for avionics \nAll internal and external lighting options \nCabin pressurization system \nCockpit and avionics \nRealistic 2D cockpit for all four variants, including different views: Default, VFR, IFR, approach/landing \nFully functional virtual cockpitVirtual Cabin \nPanel and cabin include a customized night lighting \nComplete system simulation individually adapted \nFully functional weather radar incl. display of the flight plan and waypoints \nBendix King Silver Crown Plus Avionics Suite: \nKMA 28 Audio Panel \nKY196B COMM Radio (2x) \nKN53 NAV Radio (2x) \nKR87 ADF Receiver (2x) and KT76C Transponder (2x) \nTrimble 2000 Approach Plus GPS with SID, STAR and Approach capability and updatable navigation database. \nBendix King KFC250 Autopilot (Cheyenne I and IA)\nBendix King KFC300 Autopilot (Cheyenne II and IIXL) \nDukes Pressurization Controller (Cheyenne I and IA)\nGarrett Pressurization Controller (Cheyenne II and IIXL) \nExternal Power Unit \nGround Clearance Function \nIn-Game configuration utility and load editor \nFull GoFlight Hardware support \nAerodynamics and performance\n\nRealistic flight dynamics developed in co-operation with real pilots \nAccurate airspeeds, climb rates and fuel consumption \nStunning performance and exceptional flying capabilities  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9f96113490391463d7898c7b7fc2bde9dc9048c","amp;dn":"FSX+Aerosoft+Piper+Cheyenne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9f96113490391463d7898c7b7fc2bde9dc9048c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,249,97,19,73,3,145,70,61,120,152,199,183,252,43,222,157,201,4,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
