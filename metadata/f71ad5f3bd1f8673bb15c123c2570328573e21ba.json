At the end of January Irishman in America will be released in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\n\nIrishman in America was recorded in Denmark, Germany, Ireland and the USA and was first released in the three Scandinavian countries, where Johnny Logan is quite a big name and always makes it to the charts. With this album he however didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t manage to get the top positions, as he is use to. The album was four weeks on the Danish album Top40 where it peaked as #10. In Norway it peaked as #20 with five weeks on the Top40. In Sweden it only had three weeks on the album Top60 and peaked as #24. With the coming release in Germany, Austria and Switzerland he gets another chance to make it to the absolute top.\n\nThere are a few things different on this album. Johnny LoganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s three sons, Adam (29), Fionn (24) and Jack (16), all sing chorus on the title song Irishman in America. Johnny Logan himself has worked as a producer on the whole album, which is the first time he is trying that.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f71ad5f3bd1f8673bb15c123c2570328573e21ba","amp;dn":"Johnny+Logan+-+Irishman+in+America+%282008%29+%5B256+CBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f71ad5f3bd1f8673bb15c123c2570328573e21ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,26,213,243,189,31,134,115,187,21,193,35,194,87,3,40,87,62,33,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
