General Dietrich Von Choltitz, after much rumination, decided that he didn't want to go down in history as the man who destroyed Paris. His refusal to follow Hitler's orders would make him a pariah in Germany for the rest of his life; nor was his gesture ever rewarded by the Allies. From this very human story in the midst of one of the most inhuman conflicts in history grew the screenplay (by Gore Vidal and Francis Ford Coppola) of the all-star, internationally produced Is Paris Burning? Whereas the earlier The Longest Day was able to support a castful of celebrities and brief subplot vignettes, Is Paris Burning? seems more weighted down than weighty. Still, a modern audience will have fun playing &quot;spot the star&quot; throughout the film, especially when those spotted stars include the likes of Gert Frobe (as Choltitz), Jean-Paul Belmondo, Alain Delon, Kirk Douglas (as Patton), Glenn Ford (as Bradley), Yves Montand, Simone Signoret, Robert Stack, and even Anthony Perkins as a wide-eyed GI. Filmed on a gargantuan scale, Is Paris Burning? was based on a book by Larry Collins and Dominique LaPierre. The film was lensed in black and white, save for the Technicolor finale (in the original road-show prints). &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060814/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060814/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirector:\nRenÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© ClÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©ment\n\n        Jean-Paul Belmondo\t ... \tPierrelot - Yvon Morandat\n\n\tCharles Boyer\t... \tDocteur Monod\n\tLeslie Caron\t... \tFranÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§oise LabÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©\n\n\tJean-Pierre Cassel\t... \tLieutenant Henri Karcher\n\n\tGeorge Chakiris\t... \tG.I. devant Notre Dame / GI in Tank\n\tBruno Cremer\t... \tColonel Rol Tanguy\n\tClaude Dauphin\t... \tColonel Lebel\n\tAlain Delon\t... \tJacques Chaban-Delmas\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 02:48:41\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 965 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,13 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : ATSC/A-52 Dolby AC3\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 192 Kbps\n\n\nENJOY  AND  SEED\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a158e8f7e08c904eff478eda4378efb1810f52e","amp;dn":"Is+Paris+Burning+%3F++%281966%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a158e8f7e08c904eff478eda4378efb1810f52e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,21,142,143,126,8,201,4,239,244,120,237,164,55,142,251,24,16,245,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
