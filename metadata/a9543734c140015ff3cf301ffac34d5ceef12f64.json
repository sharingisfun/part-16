It was, and still is, rare to see African films at the cinema. How rare, then is a Malagasy film? As our films belonged to the same endangered species, this created a very strong bond between us, and today ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“MahaleoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ by Raymond Rajaonarivelo and Cesar Paes is one such rare specimen of cinema from the South.\n    The projectÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s strength and originality springs not only from the subject, but also from the unique filmmaking combination, which gives a dual insight into Madagascar through the Mahaleo group and their music. Raymond is a Malagasy filmmaker, screenwriter and director of feature films. He is of the same generation as the band and has the advantage of being close to them. Cesar, a Brazilian filmmaker also from the South, is a committed almost militant documentary filmmaker of the cinema du RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©el. His view of Madagascar and the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s commitment is more distant, more strategic. Their approaches are thus very different, and the criss-crossing of this double vision is what carries the film and gives us food for thought.\n    Mahaleo and their music is an entry point for depicting Madagascar today, at a critical time in its history, after a political crisis that brought the country to the brink of civil war. Beyond this, the group also provides an interesting insight into the status and commitment of the artist in a developing country.\n\n        Marie-ClÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mence Paes\n        author - producer\n\nFile Name .........................................: Mahaleo.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,444,612,096 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:37:56\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 688x384 (AR: 1.792)\nFPS .................................................: 29.970\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1731 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.219 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 224 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0444247/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0444247/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFrench and Malagasy audio; multilanguage (Malagasy, French, English, German, Portuguese) subpack (idx/sub)\n\nMy rip of the Laterit NTSC DVD\n\nPaes, Rajaonarivelo - Mahaleo (2005)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9543734c140015ff3cf301ffac34d5ceef12f64","amp;dn":"Paes%2C+Rajaonarivelo+-+Mahaleo+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9543734c140015ff3cf301ffac34d5ceef12f64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,84,55,52,193,64,1,95,243,207,48,31,250,195,77,92,238,241,47,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
