It was a time of repressive British rule, a time of political upheaval, a time to sacrifice allfor the motherland. In the midst of this these young men, led by Sibdas Bhaduri, build themselves into a team. Through personal tavail and the troubled times, they display a level of committment and camaraderie perhaps never equalled since. And in the final, backed by a tumultuous crowd, ad playing barefoot, the pull off a famous victory. The victory was not just in a game, for it galvanised a country which believed the British to be invincible - the white gods were human after all!\n\nComments:\nThere is very little &quot;history&quot; in this fictionalised history! Apart from the great win of the Mohun Bagan eam, the rest is pure imagination and a somewhat exaggerated sense of nationalistic fervour. The British were never as concerned about a possible win as to target the individual players and their families and no one among them were charged with sedition. There is a lot of melodrama, sometimes a little too much.\n\nHaving said that, this is a fun film to watch if you are not inclined to be very critical about history. Cinematogaphy by Gopi Bhagat is excellenttttt. I liked his use of warm tones to bring out the feelings that it isa naration of past events. Acting by all the protagonists, including some non-professionals like Hirak Das in the role of Sibdas Bhaduri is outstanding. I liked the music overall too. It is a pleasure to watch the football sequences and there is a lot of laughter from the antics of the Zamindar's henchmen as well as the crowd.\n\nUploader's Notes:\nA 720p rip of this film has been uploaded before. I did this rip just for fun and to see if a HQ rip had some takers. There isn't much of technical wizardry in this rip. It's a straightforwrd encoding but I think it has come out well. The original sound has been preserved.\n\nENJOY!\n\n\n\nScreens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/db0d4e164208082&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/db0d4e164208082&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/27849e164208575&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/27849e164208575&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/973c07164208700&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/973c07164208700&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c1fddbd7d32ad2743c263b980ba83cc1d635aa3","amp;dn":"Egaro+-+The+Eleven+-+DVDRip+-+720p+-+x264+-+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c1fddbd7d32ad2743c263b980ba83cc1d635aa3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,31,221,189,125,50,173,39,67,194,99,185,128,186,131,204,29,99,90,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
