He believes the answer to ending the devastation lies in the Scourgelands. Yet, TyrusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first expedition into the cursed woods failed after being defeated by mysterious minions who stalked and killed most of his band.\n\nNow a prisoner in his own tower, Tyrus has summoned his nephew AnnonÃ¢â‚¬â€a Druidecht possessing innate magic called the firebloodÃ¢â‚¬â€on the guise of finding a hidden treasure with which to purchase his twin sister HettieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s freedom. But in reality, Tyrus is using his niece and nephew, and their magic, as an opportunity to escape and resume his desperate mission. \n\nAnd to aid them, he has enlisted the warrior-monk PaedrinÃ¢â‚¬â€who is almost as green as the siblings when it comes to traveling these troubled lands. The trio is determined, and along the way they grow to trust each otherÃ¢â‚¬â€and new additions to the groupÃ¢â‚¬â€in order to accomplish their missionsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦whether or not those missions are one and the same.\n\nBut the Arch-RikeÃ¢â‚¬â€ruthless ruler of KenatosÃ¢â‚¬â€has learned of these plans, and has sent the fearsome Kishion to destroy all those that oppose him. Now Tyrus and his unwitting allies must face down not only the plague, but this new enemyÃ¢â‚¬â€and fulfill their quest before a fresh horror is unleashed on the world...\n\nGenre: Fantasy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e3f20e5405891531ac3b953cbd3d970fb2674db","amp;dn":"Fireblood+by+Jeff+Wheeler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e3f20e5405891531ac3b953cbd3d970fb2674db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,63,32,229,64,88,145,83,26,195,185,83,203,211,217,112,251,38,116,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
