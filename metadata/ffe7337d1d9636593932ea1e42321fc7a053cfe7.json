Yossh? Sut?r??) in Japan, is the Nintendo 64 successor to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System game Super Mario World 2: YoshiÃ‚Â´s Island. It was released on December 21, 1997 in Japan, March 9, 1998 in North America and April 9, 1998 in Europe. It was re-released on the WiiÃ‚Â´s Virtual Console service in North America on September 17, 2007 and in Europe, Australia and Japan on October 26, 2007. The game was developed by the YoshiÃ‚Â´s Island team, directed by Hideki Konno, and produced by Takashi Tezuka. This was one of the first EAD-developed titles that was not produced by Shigeru Miyamoto. Like most Yoshi games, it is a 2D platformer. It features digitized 2D graphics of high resolution 3D models (similar to Donkey Kong Country), which resemble patchworks of fabric and other materials, giving it a unique look. While interviews and previews described these visual methods as 2Ã‚Â½-D, the gameplay remains completely two-dimensional. The game received mixed reviews from video game critics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffe7337d1d9636593932ea1e42321fc7a053cfe7","amp;dn":"Yoshi+Story+%5BPROPER%5D%5BPAL+-+MULTi+3+-Wii+-+VC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffe7337d1d9636593932ea1e42321fc7a053cfe7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,231,51,125,29,150,54,89,57,50,234,30,66,50,31,199,160,83,207,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
