Choying is a nun residing in a monastery high in the mountains of Tibet.  She posses one of the most naturally unaffected and pure voices I've ever heard.  Steve Tibbetts recorded Choying singing traditional songs in her mountain habitat then added aching background treatments at his studio in the states.  The result is truly genuine, honest beauty.  To me, this music defies category in the best sense.\n\nThe albums are:\n\nCho\nSelwa\n\nEnjoy and please seed!;-}\n\nJunco","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eac2f574d3411679423430640ccbc8312122cd82","amp;dn":"Choying+Drolma+%26+Steve+Tibbetts+-+2+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eac2f574d3411679423430640ccbc8312122cd82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,194,245,116,211,65,22,121,66,52,48,100,12,203,200,49,33,34,205,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
