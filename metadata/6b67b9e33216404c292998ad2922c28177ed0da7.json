The brisk uptempo tunes, like the title track, &quot;Hot Lunch Jam&quot; with it's irresistible piano line and the driving gospel of &quot;Never Alone&quot; balance the quiet &quot;Out Here On My Own&quot; and the anthemic &quot;I Sing The Body Electric&quot;.\nIf you are familiar with the TV show, &quot;ER&quot;, and unaware that Paul McCrane (&quot;Rocket&quot; Romano on ER) is a significant character in &quot;Fame&quot;, you are in for a shock. His songs, &quot;Dogs In The Yard&quot; and &quot;Is It OK If I Call You Mine?&quot; form the emotional core of the soundtrack...the latter song is his composition performed solo on guitar. \n\n\n.: CtrackList :.\n\n    Fame\n    Out Here On My Own\n    Hot Lunch Jam\n    Dogs In The Yard - Paul McCrane\n    Red Light - Linda Clifford\n    Is It Ok If I Call You Mine? - Paul McCrane\n    Never Alone - Contemporary Gospel Chours\n    Ralph And Monty - Michael Gore\n    I Sing The Body Electric\n    Miles From Here (Previously Unissued) - N/A\n    Out Here On My Own (Instrumental Version)\n    Fame (Instrumental Version)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b67b9e33216404c292998ad2922c28177ed0da7","amp;dn":"Fame+-+OST+%5BMp3+320+kbps%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b67b9e33216404c292998ad2922c28177ed0da7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,103,185,227,50,22,64,76,41,41,152,173,41,34,194,129,119,237,13,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
