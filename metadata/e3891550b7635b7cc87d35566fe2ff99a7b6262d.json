There are plenty of reasons why this show is on HBO Canada and not Showcase or Global. If you are in the USA you can find Fitz on DirecTV's in-house channel Audience Network, where the second season is to make an appearance in the not too distant future.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3891550b7635b7cc87d35566fe2ff99a7b6262d","amp;dn":"Call.Me.Fitz.s01.DVDRiP.XviD-iNGOT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3891550b7635b7cc87d35566fe2ff99a7b6262d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,137,21,80,183,99,91,124,200,125,53,86,111,226,255,153,167,182,38,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
