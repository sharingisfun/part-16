McLynn aptly reveals the extent to which Napoleon was both existential hero and plaything of fate, mathematician and mystic, intellectual giant and moral pygmy, great man and deeply flawed human being.\n\nAs NapoleonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s obsession with his family surfaces and his conviction that every man has his price, the emperor emerges as a figure closer to a modern Mafia godfather than a visionary European. In this work, McLynn brings the reader, as never before, closer to understanding the much mythologized Napoleon. 16 black-and-white illustrations\n\n\n# Paperback: 752 pages\n# Publisher: Arcade Publishing; Reprint edition (April 1, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1611450373\n# ISBN-13: 978-1611450378","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:820aa1dd7b0d1844488d0193868371d761fb9acf","amp;dn":"Napoleon%3A+A+Biography++%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"820aa1dd7b0d1844488d0193868371d761fb9acf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,10,161,221,123,13,24,68,72,141,1,147,134,131,113,215,97,251,154,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
