Each has a favorite in that collection, and none can imagine life without the peace and completion it brings. Though mere acquaintances, they plot a theft of the three pieces between the time they are packed and the time theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re loaded onto a plane. First each must obtain a forgery; then, they have to smuggle the forgeries into the museum and find a way to make the switches. The heist is complicated by RogerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intrusive wife Ã¢â‚¬â€œ heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s promised her a trip to Florida for their anniversary Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and GeorgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s proclivity for taking his clothes off when standing in front of the warrior statue he loves. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1107860/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1107860/&lt;/a&gt;\nGenre: Comedy | Crime\niMDB Rating: 6,1/10 from 7 642 users\nDirector: Peter Hewitt\nStarring: Christopher Walken, Joseph McKenna, Wynn Everett\n\n\nSource Used: The Maiden Heist 2009 BluRay 720p DTS x264-CHD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c4ec5e48a08eaf0548446762b230395b1ff2fce","amp;dn":"The+Maiden+Heist+2009+720p+BRRip+x264-PLAYNOW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c4ec5e48a08eaf0548446762b230395b1ff2fce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,78,197,228,138,8,234,240,84,132,70,118,43,35,3,149,177,255,47,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
