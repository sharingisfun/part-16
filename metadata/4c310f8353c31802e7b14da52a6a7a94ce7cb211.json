It features the work of female comic book creators, and is published by Slave Labor Graphics.\n\nThe most prominent recurring character is the eponymous superheroine Action Girl, an athletic teenage girl who thinks quickly and usually resolves conflicts with little or no combat. Some of her friends are also superheroines, including Flying Girl and Ultra Girl (formerly Neutrina).\n\nOther recurring characters include Gwen and P.J., both of whom are non-superheroic, as well as Susanoo the Brawler, a tempestuous girl related to the Japanese god. However, the majority of stories in the comic are standalone rather than episodic.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe back of issue 19 mentions issue 20, and even has a brand spanking new Action Girl t-shirt for sale, but the series did actually end with issue 19.\n\nThere is also an Action Girl website, just do a search for 'Action Girl Online'. However, while it's a perfectly functioning website, it hasn't been updated since around the time issue 19 was being solicited. There is a lot of stuff there, though, and links that lead to more current websites.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c310f8353c31802e7b14da52a6a7a94ce7cb211","amp;dn":"Action+Girl+Comics+%28SLG+-+Slave+Labor+Graphics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c310f8353c31802e7b14da52a6a7a94ce7cb211","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,49,15,131,83,195,24,2,231,177,77,165,42,106,122,148,206,124,178,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
