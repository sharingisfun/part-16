Only Toti, the young assistant reverend appointed as Agnes's spiritual guardian, is compelled to try to understand her. As the summer months fall away to winter, Agnes's story begins to emerge. And as the days to her execution draw closer, the question burns: did she or didn't she?\r\n\r\nBased on a true story, Burial Rites is a deeply moving novel about freedom and the ways we will risk everything for love. In beautiful, cut-glass prose, Hannah Kent portrays Iceland's formidable landscape, and asks: how can one woman endure when her life depends upon the stories told by others?\r\n'An outstandingly good debut . . . I found myself spellbound . . . Kent has done a great deal of research and transformed its results into a work of art.' - Literary Review","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe9866012ee6d1af78b7e86f117322a0341435a7","amp;dn":"Burial+Rites+-+Hannah+Kent","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe9866012ee6d1af78b7e86f117322a0341435a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,152,102,1,46,230,209,175,120,183,232,111,17,115,34,160,52,20,53,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
