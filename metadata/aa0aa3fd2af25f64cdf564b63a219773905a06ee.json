Reggae developed out of the 1950s Jamaican R\\'n\\'B scene and \\&quot;Easy Skanking\\&quot; was a huge Jamaican R\\'n\\'B hit in the 1950s. In that song you can hear the seeds being sown for the music that the world would eventually know as reggae.  \n\ni Wayne is part of the new-wave rasta movement. The track \\&quot;Living In Love\\&quot; is a modern roots classic. When \\&quot;Living In Love\\&quot; was released in the UK it was pumped out over the airwaves by pirate reggae radio stations and provided a musical high-point for the undeground reggae scene that summer.\n\nQueen Omega lays down the rasta vibe from a womens point of view. Rasta women have played a fundamental part in rasta culture. Their role is often overlooked.\n\nI\\'ve included the Reggae Sunsplash because its not available anymore and was last seeded here on TPB years ago but that torrent has been not seeded for years.\n\nThe Hi Fever is hard to find. A \\&quot;one riddim\\&quot; album with a variety of artists singing a lyric over it.\n\nAs with a lot of reggae releases only some of the tracks will stand out as great tunes. So have a listen and the choose your favourites.\n\n\n\n \n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa0aa3fd2af25f64cdf564b63a219773905a06ee","amp;dn":"Reggae+%28Studio+One%2C+Dancehall%2C+i+Wayne%2C+Capelton%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa0aa3fd2af25f64cdf564b63a219773905a06ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,10,163,253,42,242,95,100,205,245,100,182,58,33,151,115,144,90,6,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
