This second edition contains many new and updated sections, including a completely new chapter on transport in ultrasmall devices and coverage of &quot;full band&quot; transport. Lundstrom also covers both low- and high-field transport, scattering, transport in devices, and transport in mesoscopic systems. He explains in detail the use of Monte Carlo simulation methods and provides many homework exercises along with a variety of worked examples. What makes this book unique is its broad theoretical treatment of transport for advanced students and researchers engaged in experimental semiconductor device research and development.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c0fa5a899fba5150a5c2784216521959a7a05b8","amp;dn":"%5BDJVU%5D+%5B2000%5D+Fundamentals+of+Carrier+Transport+2nd+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c0fa5a899fba5150a5c2784216521959a7a05b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,15,165,168,153,251,165,21,10,92,39,132,33,101,33,149,154,122,5,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
