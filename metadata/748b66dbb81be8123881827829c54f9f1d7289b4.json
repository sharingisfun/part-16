This release 1998 on JVC.\n\nReview by Michael G. Nastos(AMG)\nRed Garland\\'s third recording as a leader has him playing very well, somewhat energetic and more inclusive in his direction to span the mainstream jazz palate beyond the cool exterior he emanates. The title might be a bit deceptive, for this is not a project where soul-jazz or early boogaloo influences turned jazzmen into groovemeisters - it\\'s a swinging groove. With bassist Paul Chambers and drummer Art Taylor, Garland has all the support he needs to wing it in a variety of directions. Recorded in that most legendary year of jazz, 1957, Garland is coming into his own in a more confident way, buoyed by his association at the time with Miles Davis. Chambers is flawless in his support role, and on this recording deserves a close listen, especially for students of the acoustic upright. They immediately dig in on the opener \\&quot;C Jam Blues,\\&quot; with Garland at his heartiest during his bridge solo, they agree in the affirmative during the entirety of the hard bop take of \\&quot;Will You Still Be Mine?,\\&quot; and repeat but modify the melody ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  la \\&quot;Cool Blues\\&quot; in an adept display of artistry for \\&quot;Hey Now.\\&quot; Of course Garland has to play a ballad or two, as on \\&quot;Willow Weep for Me,\\&quot; luscious with chord sequences, and really reflects the influence of Erroll Garner in that chiming, two-handed sustenato style for Garner\\'s \\&quot;Gone Again.\\&quot; It is said that by the third recording, most musicians should have their style down pat and begin attempting to take the music to a higher level. You really hear that in this recording, which was a springboard to making Red Garland one of the most revered and respected jazz pianists of the modern era. \n\nRed Garland - Piano\nPaul Chambers - Bass\nArt Taylor - Drums\n\n01.
