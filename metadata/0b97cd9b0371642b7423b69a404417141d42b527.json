Sell your apps in the Windows Phone Marketplace and make this book pay for itself!\n\nVolume I contains the first 50 apps and covers the following:\nEverything you need to know about Silverlight\nFully exploiting phone features such as the application bar, hardware/software keyboards, multi-touch, accelerometer, microphone, and more\nUsing rich controls such as pivots, panoramas, and controls in free toolkits, such as date/time pickers, toggle switches, charts, and graphs\nBuilding your own custom controls, including popular ones missing from the platform, such as a checkable list box, multi-select picker box, and color picker\nBroadly applicable pages, such as a photo-cropping page and accelerometer-calibration page\nHow to make your app look and feel like a first-party app\nPractical tips on a wide range of topics, even acquiring and creating sound effects, using custom fonts, and creating icons\n\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b97cd9b0371642b7423b69a404417141d42b527","amp;dn":"101+Windows+Phone+7+Apps-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b97cd9b0371642b7423b69a404417141d42b527","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,151,205,155,3,113,100,43,116,35,182,154,64,68,23,20,29,66,181,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
