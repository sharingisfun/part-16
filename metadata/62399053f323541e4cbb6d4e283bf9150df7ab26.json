But they left behind one thing: Shootertron, the cunning leader of the evil Fantasticons! Fortunately for Earth, Shootertron's memory is a little fuzzy. Unfortunately for Earth, the rest of the Incredible Change-Bots seem to be on their way back! It's all-new action, drama, and comedy as Shootertron struggles to find an identity on Earth and the rest of the Change-Bots struggle to accomplish much of anything. Hilarious and gleefully childlike, Jeffrey Brown's Incredible Change-Bots Two is a nostalgic tribute to Saturday morning cartoons.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62399053f323541e4cbb6d4e283bf9150df7ab26","amp;dn":"Jeffrey+Brown+-+Incredible+Change-Bots+Two","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62399053f323541e4cbb6d4e283bf9150df7ab26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,57,144,83,243,35,84,30,76,187,109,78,40,59,249,21,13,247,171,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
