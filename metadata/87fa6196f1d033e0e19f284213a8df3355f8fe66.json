The other side doesn't play by the rules much anymore. There's thinking, in some circles, that we need to play by a different set of rules too . . .'\n\nJames Bond, in his early thirties and already a veteran of the Afghan War, has been recruited to a new organization. Conceived in the post-9/11 world, it operates independent of MI5, MI6 and the Ministry of Defense, its very existence deniable. Its aim: To protect the Realm, by any means necessary.\n\nA Night Action alert calls James Bond away from dinner with a beautiful woman. Headquarters has decrypted an electronic whisper about an attack scheduled for later in the week: Casualties estimated in the thousands, British interests adversely affected.\n\nAnd Agent 007 has been given carte blanche.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87fa6196f1d033e0e19f284213a8df3355f8fe66","amp;dn":"Carte+Blanche+%28New+James+Bond+Novel%29++-++Jeffrey+Deaver","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87fa6196f1d033e0e19f284213a8df3355f8fe66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,250,97,150,241,208,51,224,225,159,40,66,19,168,223,51,85,248,254,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
