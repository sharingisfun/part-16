You get every\nera spanning Dios career since the early 70s\nwith Elf up until his last great effort in the\n1990s Strange Highways.\nAs someone who was an already established\nenthusiast for Dios Sabbath and solo work at\nthe time, my main reason for getting this\nrelease was the Elf and Rainbow material, the\nformer of which I was 100% unexposed to while\nthe latter had only been touched upon due to\nlive performances and one greatest hits\ncompilation.\nThe Elf material, for its time, is quite an\ninnovative fusion of blues and rock that\nrequires a bit of historical perspective in\norder to grasp. When you consider that the\nheaviest thing going on at the time was Black\nSabbath and that they were considered an\naberration, this is quite hard edged stuff and a\npath can been seen to where Dio would grow into\nwhat he is now.\nThe Rainbow stuff includes the obvious tour\nfavorites Long Live Rock and Roll and Man on\nthe Silver Mountain, as well as the only\nslightly less well known Starstruck. Although\nthese songs are all a great listen and rock\nhard, I had hoped that more epic tracks such as\nGates of Babylon would have made it onto here,\nbut of course those tracks are to be found on\nRainbow compilations.\nThe Black Sabbath stuff is presented\nchronologically, which is a breath of fresh air\nas most Sabbath compilations are dreadfully\nunorganized. You have all the essentials from\nboth the early 80s era as well as the strongest\nsong from the 1992 reunion in Computer God. We\nalso get a great live version of Voodoo from\nthe Mob Rules tour back in 1982 that qualifies\nas a genuine rarity.\nDios solo material has also been well organized\nand includes pretty much all the no-brainer\ntracks from the first two albums. We get a live\nversion of Sacred Heart from the famous tour\nthat spawned the Video concert carrying the same\nname, definitely a great perk for the Dio fan\nthat already has most of the discography. To my\nrelief, the Dream Evil material was not given\nthe shaft and the two best songs from it are\nfound on here. Likewise, both Lock up the Wolves\nand Strange Highways managed to get their title\ntracks onto this compilation, rounding out the\ntail end of a career that spanned more than 20\nyears at that point.\nTo the prospective buyer who is looking for some\nstuff with Ronnie Dio attached to it that is not\nfound on the LPs, as well as the fan of metal\nwho wishes an introduction to the artist, this\nis the album to go for. It listens extremely\nwell owing to it being well organized and all of\nthe songs being digitally remastered, which is\nmore than what I can say for the majority of the\nlarge amount of Dio greatest hits CDs out there.\nGet yourself a copy today and be prepared to\nStand up and Shout.\nDiscography\nHoly Diver Full-length, 1983\nHoly Diver Single, 1983\nRainbow in the Dark Single, 1983\nLive in Concert Video/VHS, 1984\nMystery Single, 1984\nThe Last in Line Single, 1984\nWe Rock Single, 1984\nThe Last in Line Full-length, 1984\nA Special From the Spectrum Video/VHS, 1984\nHungry for Heaven Single, 1985\nLike the Beat of a Heart (Live) Single, 1985\nRock 'n' Roll Children Single, 1985\nSuper Rock '85 in Japan Video/VHS, 1985\nSacred Heart Full-length, 1985\nThe Dio E.P EP, 1986\nKing of Rock &amp;
