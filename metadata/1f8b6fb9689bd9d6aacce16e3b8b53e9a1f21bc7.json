The song was the third single from the group's 1999 album The Writing's on the Wall, released through Columbia label in 2000. The single is the most successful of the four releases from the album and is considered to be one of their signature songs. The song won awards for &quot;Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals&quot; and &quot;Best R&amp;B Song&quot; and two was nominated for &quot;Record of the Year&quot; and &quot;Song of the Year&quot; at the 2001 Grammy Awards and an MTV Video Music Award.\n\n&quot;Say My Name&quot; features Destiny's Child lead singer BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Knowles's character calling her lover on the phone, and suspecting him of cheating. She asks him to &quot;say her name&quot;. The young man hesitates, and the narrator believes it's because he doesn't want the girl he's cheating on her with to know who she is. Rodney Jerkins supports the song's lyrics with a backing track that shifts back and forth in dynamics, steadily bringing different elements (syncopated, 808 drum programming, synthesized strings, and 1970s-style wah-wah guitar licks) in and out of the mix. In the song, BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© sings lead on the verses and bridge. She leads the melody in the first singing of the chorus, and sings over the chorus. Former Member LeToya Luckett leads the second singing of the chorus. Kelly Rowland sings background saying &quot;around you&quot;, &quot;love you&quot;, &quot;shady&quot;, and &quot;baby&quot; underneath LeToya. LaTavia Roberson sings the melody and bridge underneath LeToya. Although she is not in the video, this is one of the two songs by Destiny's Child that LeToya Luckett has lead vocals on.\n\nBeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Giselle Knowles (born September 4, 1981), often known simply as BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© (pronounced /biÃƒâ€¹Ã‹â€ jÃƒâ€°Ã¢â‚¬â„¢nseÃƒâ€°Ã‚Âª/ bee-YON-say), is an American Pop/R&amp;B singer, songwriter, actress and fashion designer. Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she enrolled in various performing arts schools and was first exposed to singing and dancing competitions as a child. Knowles rose to fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of the R&amp;B girl group Destiny's Child, one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time.\n\nDuring the hiatus of Destiny's Child, Knowles released her debut solo album Dangerously in Love (2003), which spawned the number one hits &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; and &quot;Baby Boy&quot; and became one of the most successful albums of that year, earning her a then record-tying five Grammy Awards. Following the group's disbandment in 2005, Knowles released B'Day in 2006. It debuted at number one on the Billboard charts and included the hits &quot;DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©jÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  Vu&quot;, &quot;Irreplaceable&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Liar&quot;. Her third solo album I Am... Sasha Fierce, released in November 2008, included the anthemic &quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)&quot;. The album and its singles earned her six Grammy Awards, breaking the record for most Grammy Awards won by a female artist in one night. Knowles is one of the most honored artists by the Grammys, and third among female artists, with 16 awardsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½13 as a solo artist and three as a member of Destiny's Child.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f8b6fb9689bd9d6aacce16e3b8b53e9a1f21bc7","amp;dn":"Beyonce+-+Say+My+Name+%28mp4-2nafish%29+1080p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f8b6fb9689bd9d6aacce16e3b8b53e9a1f21bc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,139,111,185,104,155,217,214,170,204,225,110,59,139,83,233,161,242,27,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
