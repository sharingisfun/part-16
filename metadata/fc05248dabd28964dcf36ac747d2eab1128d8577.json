He fits in quite nicely, which is convenient, because the millionaire&amp;#039;s good-for-nothing family is hatching a plot that will leave him in rags for real.\n\nIt seems that the familyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a socialite daughter, playboy son, snooty brother and hypochondriac sister-in-lawÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½has decided that the only way to keep everybody&amp;#039;s favorite moneybags sober is to convince him that he has already squandered his fortune. The relatives forsake their hacienda to rent a shabby apartment and don very neat work clothes, in an effort to convince him that times are rough. Their ruse doesn&amp;#039;t workÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and why should it? They still sneak cream puffs when the old man isn&amp;#039;t looking.\n\nBut the millionaire comes up with a scheme of his own, and it&amp;#039;s a wonderful success: He convinces the others that they really are poor and, as if by magic, these freeloaders learn to support themselves. Pretty soon everyone is back home in the mansion, where the snooty brother mends gilt furniture and the sister-in-law bakes bread. The lazy son decides to go back to college, and the daughter breaks off with a gigolo to marry a diligent poor boy she met in the slums. Through it all, the millionaire beams wisely. Everybody lives more than happily ever after.\n\nThis story, based on a comedy by Adolfo Torrado, would have amounted only to the airiest of fluff had not BuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±uel taken merry advantage of the plot&amp;#039;s several layers of deceit. The film, which has an exaggerated visual elegance to match its characters&amp;#039; fine manners, contains several delightful episodes in which the family&amp;#039;s cordiality, never worth much in the first place, is worn even thinner than usual by everyone&amp;#039;s complete uncertainty about just what everyone else is up to. But, BuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±uel being BuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±uel, politesse easily prevails at the expense of reason.\n\n\nRoot of All Good\nTHE GREAT MADCAP (EL GRAN CALAVERA), directed by Luis Bunuel; screenplay (Spanish with English subtitles) by Raquel Rojas and Luis Alcoriza, from a comedy by Adolfo Torrado; photography, Ezequiel Carrascu; music, Manuel Esperon; editing by Carlos Savage: produced by Ultramar Films S.A.
