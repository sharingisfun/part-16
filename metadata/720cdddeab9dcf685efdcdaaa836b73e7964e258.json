Unfortunately, Weston has no idea why he's suddenly an untouchable, and trying to get to the bottom of the mystery is rather difficult and dangerous without being able to use his previous resources and contacts.\n\nCompletely written and created by Matt Nix, this new USA series combines various action and thriller elements with a fresh sense of humour played out by a new breed of spy. The series premiere, shows commercial-free, will air on Thursday, June 28th at 10/9C. Throughout the summer, new episodes will continue to air on Thursdays at 10/9C.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:720cdddeab9dcf685efdcdaaa836b73e7964e258","amp;dn":"Burn+Notice+S02E02+HDTV+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"720cdddeab9dcf685efdcdaaa836b73e7964e258","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,12,221,222,171,157,207,104,94,253,205,170,168,54,183,62,121,100,226,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
