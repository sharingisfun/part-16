Austin, Texas, 1915) spent over six decades working to promote knowledge and appreciation of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s folk music. He began his career in 1933 alongside his father, the pioneering folklorist John Avery Lomax, author of the best-selling Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads (1910). In 1934, the two launched an effort to expand the holdings of recorded folk music at the Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress (established 1928), gathering thousands of field recordings of folk musicians throughout the American South, Southwest, Midwest, and Northeast, as well as in Haiti and the Bahamas. Their collecting resulted in several popular and influential anthologies of American folk songs, including American Ballads and Folk Songs (New York: Macmillan, 1934); Negro Folk Songs as Sung by Lead Belly (New York: Macmillan, 1936), the first in depth biographical study of an American folk musician; Our Singing Country (with Ruth Crawford Seeger) (New York: Macmillian, 1941); and Folk Song USA (New York: Duell, Sloan and Pierce 1947).\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a7cbf23ee75a9ca325f2fd3aa419c55f6f4486a","amp;dn":"%28Folk%29+Alan+Lomax+-+Texas+Folk+Songs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a7cbf23ee75a9ca325f2fd3aa419c55f6f4486a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,124,191,35,238,117,169,202,50,95,47,211,170,65,156,85,246,244,72,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
