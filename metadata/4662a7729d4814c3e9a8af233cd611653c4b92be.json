All 26 episodes are around 170 mb, crisp in High Quality MP4 format and WILL fit onto a single DVD. The dub is original japanese with english subs hardcoded. Go elsewhere for the english dub. \n\nI have many custom 1DVD convertions of classic animes to share if this torrent goes well. Feel free to comment.\n\nKEEP THE SEEDING ALIVE.\n\nGENRES: ................. adventure, fantasy, science fiction\nTHEMES: ................. steampunk, friendship, war, flying machines\nRUNNING TIME: ........... 24 minutes per episode\nEPISODES: ............... 25\nRELEASED: ................ 2003\nVIDEO: .................. 1024x576 997kbit/s 24fps MP4\nAUDIO: .................. 126 kbit/s 32kHz Stereo Japanese\nSUBS: ...................

They become involved with a mysterious mission after rescuing a little girl from a strange star-shaped killing machine. Not willing to let the girl die, they complete the mission by delivering her to the legendary mercenary ship Sylvana, only to become part of the crew as fighter pilots.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4662a7729d4814c3e9a8af233cd611653c4b92be","amp;dn":"Last+Exile+1-26+%5BEngSub_Custom1DVD%5D+1024x576+MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4662a7729d4814c3e9a8af233cd611653c4b92be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,98,167,114,157,72,20,195,233,168,175,35,60,214,17,101,60,75,146,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
