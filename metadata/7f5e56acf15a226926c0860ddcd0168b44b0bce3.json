De har snabbt byggt en stor och trogen fanbase med bÃƒÂ¥de Raubtier-fans och nya mer country/rock-intresserade fans.\n\n\n&quot;This new album Hail to the Chief is a homage to the music I and we together hold dear and true. Spanning from pure countrymusic to rootsy rock'n'roll, we wanted to refine and re-define the essence of what is Bourbon Boys. I have never been so proud of an album in my entire life.\n\nWe have seen the inside of many a smoky clubstages around Europe, and many of the songs that are included on this album have been tested before a live audience before we recorded them. We wanted to make an album that was true to the legacy of real and substantial music. With authentic sounds. Every song on this album is a heartfelt and honest composition, dealing musically with the challenge of the groove and lyrically with the hardships of living.\n\nThe production is beyond top of the line. I believe true magic was created under Mr. Jonas Kjellgrens sensitive surveillance, as he managed to capture that mystical nerve that a band of brothers that has bled upon the road together earns.\nI am damn proud, and I hope y'all will enjoy what we have created.&quot;\nSincerely\n//Hulkoff, Bourbon Boys\n\n\n\nLÃƒÂ¥tlista\n\n    1.
