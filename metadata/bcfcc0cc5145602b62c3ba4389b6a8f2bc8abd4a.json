The latest version of our video converter has been redesigned so it's easier to customize settings like file size and audio tracks or subtitles. Additionally, DivX Plus output (.mkv) is now free so you can always create MKV files with advanced features. \n\n\nDivX Plus video advanced features\nWe've taken the best aspects of MKV video and made them even better. In addition to creating standard DivX videos, the DivX Plus Converter allows you to create MKV videos with advanced features such as smooth fast forward and rewind.\n\n\nCustomize your videos\nDivX Plus Converter introduces a variety of features to customize your videos. If you have language tracks or subtitles in your movie that you don't need, it's easy to remove them. If you need to make sure your video fits on your 1GB USB drive, simply limit the file size. The new interface of DivX Plus Converter also makes it easy to set video bitrate, pass through original audio tracks and more.\n\n\nTo create your own DivX files (.divx), you'll need to purchase DivX Pro to unlock the pro features of DivX Converter. You can try the pro features for free in DivX Plus Converter and DivX Plus Codec Pack for 15 days (there's also a 30-day money-back guarantee). Your purchase of DivX Pro unlocks the ability to:\n\nEasily convert MKV, WMV, AVI, MOV or MP4 files to .divx\nUse pre-set profiles to create high-quality DivX videos for your DivX Home Theater, DivX HD or DivX Mobile devices\nCreate .divx files in your favorite video applications like Sony Vegas or VirtualDub\n\n\nConvert personal DVDs to DivX\n\nManaging a library of physical DVDs can be a hassle.
