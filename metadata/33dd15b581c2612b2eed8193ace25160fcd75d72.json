Caunitz was a New York City Police Department officer who used his own experiences to write best-selling thrillers.\n\n  From back cover:\nNew York Times best-selling thriller author William J. Caunitz creates this bruising story of a city caught in the grips of widespread corruption. When a police detective delves into a troubled New York City precinct, a trail of blood and money leads him through drug-strangled streets and his own embattled chain of command. After months of silence, First Deputy Commissioner Suzanne Albrecht orders Lieutenant Matt Stuart, her one-time lover, to her office. She suspects a scandal is brewing on her watch that could destroy all her ambitions of becoming the cityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first female commissioner. Matt is her only hope of nosing out the problem without blowing the lid off. As he gets closer to the truth, Matt finds himself caught between organized crime gangs and a woman who will stop at nothing to protect herself. Former NYPD detective William J. Caunitz skillfully portrays authentic tragedies and traditions of the police force. The gritty prose and dialog crackle with veteran narrator Frank MullerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dramatic performance.\n\n\n Awards:\n- AudioFile Earphones Award\n- A New York Times Notable Book of the Year","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33dd15b581c2612b2eed8193ace25160fcd75d72","amp;dn":"CHAINS+OF+COMMAND+-+William+J.+Caunitz.+Frank+Muller+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33dd15b581c2612b2eed8193ace25160fcd75d72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,221,21,181,129,194,97,43,46,237,129,147,172,226,81,96,252,215,93,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
