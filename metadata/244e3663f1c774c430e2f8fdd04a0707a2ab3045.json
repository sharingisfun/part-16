It is here reprinted along with two later reconsiderations, one of which answers its major critics, while the second places the theory in relation to Russian Formalism and French Structuralism.\n\nOriginally conceived to clarify the formal experiments of avant-garde literature, the idea of spatial form, when placed in this wider context, also contributes importantly to the foundations of a general poetics of the literary text. Also included are related discussions of AndrÃƒÂ© Malraux, Heinrich WÃƒÂ¶lfflin, Herbert Read, and E. H. Gombrich.\n\nNew material has been added to the essays in the form of footnotes and postscripts to two of them. These either illustrate the continuing relevance of the questions raised, or offer Frank's more recent opinions on the topic.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:244e3663f1c774c430e2f8fdd04a0707a2ab3045","amp;dn":"Joseph+Frank+-+The+Idea+of+Spatial+Form+%281991%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"244e3663f1c774c430e2f8fdd04a0707a2ab3045","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,78,54,99,241,199,116,196,48,226,248,253,208,74,7,7,162,171,48,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
