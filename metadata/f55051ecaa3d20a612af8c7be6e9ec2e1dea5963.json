Four years ago Jess Albert got the news that her husband Jeff was killed in action in Afghanistan, and a painful void entered her life. The more time passed, the more acutely she felt that emptiness. But when Tyler Brown, former military hero and all-around alpha male, shows up a year after sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d last seen him, Jess gradually begins to realize there is one thing that can make her feel whole againÃ¢â‚¬â€love.\n\nAs theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re planning their wedding and new life together, Jess receives shocking news: her husband is alive, under the care of a young Afghani woman hiding him from the Taliban. Even as he sees their happily-ever-after slip away, Ty arranges for the One Eyed Jacks and Black Ops, Inc. teams to make a daring and dangerous rescue mission to bring Jeff home. The hardest thing Ty or Jess has ever done is to let the other go.\n\nWhen Jeff returns to Jess, broken physically and emotionally and with no memory of their history, they try to heal their marriage and each other. But as time brings them together more as friends than lovers, an unexpected development helps them see the true way home, to the people they love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f55051ecaa3d20a612af8c7be6e9ec2e1dea5963","amp;dn":"The+Way+Home+-+Cindy+Gerard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f55051ecaa3d20a612af8c7be6e9ec2e1dea5963","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,80,81,236,170,61,32,166,18,175,140,123,230,233,236,46,29,234,89,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
