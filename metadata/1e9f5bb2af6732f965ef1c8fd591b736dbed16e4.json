We borrow our name from an ancient Indian philosophy, which translates to mean Non-Duality.\n\nSince the group was formed, in 2004, Advaita has steadily grown to become one of the most respected acts on the Indian music scene. Our sound is a mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lange of the styles, moods and textures we have taken in from different cultures and different music systems of the world. \n\nYet the endeavor remains, to dwell into the very source, the fountainhead where music springs from, and discover something organically new. It is thus, for us, a spiritual quest as much as an exploration into the world of music. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.advaitaonline.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.advaitaonline.net/&lt;/a&gt;\nhttp://www.advaitaonline.net/grounded_in_space/index.htm\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e9f5bb2af6732f965ef1c8fd591b736dbed16e4","amp;dn":"%5BIndie+from+India%5D+Advaita+-+Grounded+in+Space+%5B2009%5D+%5Bthunderba","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e9f5bb2af6732f965ef1c8fd591b736dbed16e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,159,91,178,175,103,50,249,101,239,28,143,213,145,183,54,219,237,22,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
