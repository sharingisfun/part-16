From discussions about mundane matters to considerations of deals with the USSR and China, the IRA letters delve into just about every matter conceivable for a paramilitary organisation. Some of the ideas are mundane discussions about money and the likelihood of infiltration but others, like the proposal to source gas for use in Ireland, are a dangerous and unnerving insight into how the organisation saw itself and conducted its business in secrecy.With the eye of a historian and the tools of a professional code breaker, Thomas and Jim have together created a wonderful and engrossing read.
