They are a genetic offshoot of the Deviants on Earth and the extra-terrestrial Skrulls. They arrived on Earth and infiltrated the small town called of Clairton, in West Virginia, by shifting into human form, and later, began to infiltrate governments and other important organizations across the world with the aim of taking over the planet. \n\nROM was a one of number of cyborg warriors called 'Spaceknights', who were created to defend his homeworld of Galador from the Dire Wraiths. He had fought them across the universe until finding them on entrenched Earth.\n \nROM battled the Dire Wraiths covertly and it did not breakout into all-out war until the Wraiths presence on Earth became public. Once this happened practically every hero on Earth became involved in the conflict, including the Avengers, X-Men, S.H.I.E.L.D., the Fantastic Four and Alpha Flight.\n\nThis collection covers that war.
