It has appeared in remixed form on Platinum Underground and Vanilla Ice Is Back! A live version appears on the album Extremely Live, while a rap rock version appears on the album Hard to Swallow, under the title &quot;Too Cold&quot;.\n\n&quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot; was initially released as the B-side to Vanilla Ice's cover of &quot;Play That Funky Music&quot;, but the single was not initially successful. When a disc jockey played &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot; instead, it began to gain success. &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot; was the first hip hop single to top the Billboard charts.

The song came fifth in VH1 and Blenders 2004 list of the &quot;50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs Ever.&quot; In December 2007, the song was ranked No. 29 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the 90's.\n\nIce Ice Baby garnered critical acclaim. &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot; was the first hip hop single to top the Billboard charts. It has been credited for helping diversify hip hop by introducing it to a mainstream audience.\n\nEntertainment Weekly reviewer Mim Udovitch wrote that &quot;[Vanilla Ice] probably would have scored with his hit rap single 'Ice Ice Baby' even if he hadn't been white. There's just something about the way its hook Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a sample from Queen and David Bowie's 'Under Pressure' Ã¢â‚¬â€ grabs you and flings you out onto the dance floor.&quot;\n\n\nRobert Matthew Van Winkle (born October 31, 1967), better known by his stage name, Vanilla Ice, is an American rapper, actor and television host. Born in South Dallas, and raised in Texas and South Florida, Ice released his debut album, Hooked, in 1989 on Ichiban Records, before signing a contract with SBK Records, a record label of the EMI Group which released a reformatted version of the album under the title To the Extreme.\n\nIn 1985, he was focusing all of his energy on motocross, winning three straight titles at the Grand National Championships in Dallas. After breaking his ankle during a race, Ice was not interested in racing professionally for some time, using his spare time to perfect his dance moves and creating his own while his ankle was healing. Ice used his beatboxing and breakdancing skills as a street performer with his friends at local malls during this time. One evening he visited City Lights, a South Dallas night club, where he was dared to go on stage by his friend Squirrel during an Open Mic. He won the crowd over and was asked by City Lights manager John Bush if he wanted to perform regularly, which he accepted. Ice would be joined on stage with his disc jockey D-Shay and Zero as well as Earthquake, the local disc jockey at City Lights. The Vanilla Ice Posse or The V.I.P. would also perform with Ice on stage. As a performer for City Lights, Ice opened up for N.W.A, Public Enemy, The D.O.C., Tone LÃ…ï¿½c, 2 Live Crew, Paula Abdul, Sinbad and MC Hammer.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Ice_Baby&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Ice_Baby&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KaIlJAAGa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KaIlJAAGa&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 7500kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 256kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:57\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
