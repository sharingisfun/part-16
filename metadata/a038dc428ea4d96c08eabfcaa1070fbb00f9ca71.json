In this unconventional introduction, physicist Leonard Susskind and hacker-scientist George Hrabovsky offer a first course in physics and associated math for the ardent amateur. Unlike most popular physics booksÃ¢â‚¬â€which give readers a taste of what physicists know but shy away from equations or mathÃ¢â‚¬â€Susskind and Hrabovsky actually teach the skills you need to do physics, beginning with classical mechanics, yourself. Based on SusskindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enormously popular Stanford University-based (and YouTube-featured) continuing-education course, the authors cover the minimumÃ¢â‚¬â€the theoretical minimum of the titleÃ¢â‚¬â€that readers need to master to study more advanced topics.\nAn alternative to the conventional go-to-college method, The Theoretical Minimum provides a tool kit for amateur scientists to learn physics at their own pace.\n\nAbout the Authors &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img11/9319/leonardn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img11/9319/leonardn.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nLeonard Susskind has been the Felix Bloch Professor in theoretical physics at Stanford University since 1978. The author of &quot;The Cosmic Landscape&quot; and &quot;The Black Hole War,&quot; he is a member of the National Academy of Science and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the recipient of numerous prizes including the science writing prize of the American Institute of Physics for his Scientific American article on black holes.

Since May 1999 he has been the president of Madison Area Science and Technology (MAST), a nonprofit organization dedicated to scientific and technological research and education. A US Navy veteran and self-taught physicist, Mr. Hrabovsky does research into theoretical and computational physics specializing in astrophysics, atmospheric physics, information theory, and gravitation. He lives in Madison, Wisconsin. \n\nCONTENTSÃ‚Â Ã‚Â \nPreface\nLECTURE 1Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â The Nature of Classical Physics\nInterlude 1Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Spaces, Trigonometry, and Vectors\nLECTURE 2Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â MotionÃ‚Â Ã‚Â \nInterlude 2Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Integral Calculus\nLECTURE 3Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â DynamicsÃ‚Â Ã‚Â \nInterlude 3Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Partial Differentiation\nLECTURE 4Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Systems of More Than One Particle\nLECTURE 5Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Energy\nLECTURE 6Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â The Principle of Least Action\nLECTURE 7Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Symmetries and Conservation Laws\nLECTURE 8Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Hamiltonian Mechanics and Time-Translation Invariance\nLECTURE 9Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â The Phase Space Fluid and the Gibbs-Liouville Theorem\nLECTURE 10Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Poisson Brackets, Angular Momentum, and Symmetries\nLECTURE 11Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Electric and Magnetic ForcesÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â \nAppendix 1Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  Central Forces and Planetary OrbitsÃ‚Â Ã‚Â \nIndex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a038dc428ea4d96c08eabfcaa1070fbb00f9ca71","amp;dn":"The+Theoretical+Minimum+-+What+You+Need+to+K+Start+Doing+Physics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a038dc428ea4d96c08eabfcaa1070fbb00f9ca71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,56,220,66,142,164,217,108,8,234,191,202,161,7,15,187,0,249,202,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
