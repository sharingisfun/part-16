Although they experienced only moderate commercial success, they achieved a significant cult following[1] and were one of the most popular and influential lo-fi rock bands of the 1990s.[1][2] In their initial ten-year career, they released five full length records, and a slew of EPs. The group remained signed to an independent label throughout their entire career. The group disbanded in 1999, but after a nine year hiatus a reunion was announced in late 2009. [3] They are set to play their first show in ten years in March. \n\n   1. &quot;Major Leagues [edit]&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:01\n   2. &quot;Your Time to Change&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10\n   3. &quot;Stub Your Toe&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:34\n   4. &quot;Major Leagues [demo version]&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:07\n   5. &quot;Decouvert de Soleil&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:07\n   6. &quot;The Killing Moon&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:15\n   7. &quot;The Classical&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:955f1b8c24ad647137832ffd50f35a8faa194c41","amp;dn":"Pavement+-+Major+Leagues+%5BEP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"955f1b8c24ad647137832ffd50f35a8faa194c41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,95,27,140,36,173,100,113,55,131,47,253,80,243,90,143,170,25,76,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
