Sidebars feature prominent, key figures within Ford, the cars in popular culture, significant contemporary automobiles from competitors, and more. Two hundred rare photographs and illustrations from the collections of The Henry Ford and from photographers around the country marvelously illustrate the iconic automobile.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71f8f9f5e67d50a33ea7c185b9c7a3817171f0f6","amp;dn":"40s+Ford+%28US+Cars+History%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71f8f9f5e67d50a33ea7c185b9c7a3817171f0f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,248,249,245,230,125,80,163,62,167,193,133,185,199,163,129,113,113,240,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
