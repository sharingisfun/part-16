In Damsels, the alluring princesses of classic fairy tales take up arms to save their kingdoms from war. Rediscover the darkness at the heart of fairy tales and why they'll be no happily ever after. Damsels opens with Rapa wishing she had not got out of bed that morning, if she had a bed to get out of that is. The day began badly and has gone rapidly and literally downhill ever since. A series of peculiar and baffling encounters throw obstacle after obstacle into her path, intent it seems on preventing her progress. The thing is, until today she had no idea she was trying to make any progress, toward anything! A collection of hazy memories and bewildering tattoos are all she has to help her figure it all out, and to be honest, she'd just as soon not bother. Around her, we see the mountain city of Caumont thrown into overdrive by the arrival of Queen Talia and King Aurore of Perrault. The streets are thronged with cheering people, does it matter they aren't exactly sure why they are cheering, or for whom? \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7802667/Damsels_002&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7802667/Damsels_002&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b24cab0edc35bc55cc2349126ffc2e18c0dd4f2","amp;dn":"Damsels+%231","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b24cab0edc35bc55cc2349126ffc2e18c0dd4f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,36,202,176,237,195,91,197,92,194,52,145,38,255,194,225,140,13,212,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
