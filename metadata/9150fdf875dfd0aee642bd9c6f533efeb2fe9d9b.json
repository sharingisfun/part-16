In 1980 she teamed up with her twin sister for the release &quot;Messin' With The Boys&quot;.\n\nThe album featured a backup of musicians that included most of the band Toto. Steve Lukather (guitars), Mike Porcaro (bass), Steve Porcaro (keyboards) and David Paich (keyboards) all appear on the album on many tracks. Bobby Kimball sings with Cherie and Marie on &quot;I Just Love The Feeling&quot; which sounds just like a Toto song of the period. There is a fun cover of the Russ Ballard tune &quot;Since You've Been Gone&quot; which was of course more famously covered by Rainbow.\n\nThe 1998 CD release includes a number of bonus tracks, some Cherie and Marie and the rest just Cherie. Not really any info included about them but they sound like they were probably demos. Another Russ Ballard tune is covered - &quot;I Surrender&quot; (which was also covered by Rainbow!). The final track is a remake of the Runaways &quot;Cherry Bomb&quot;.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9150fdf875dfd0aee642bd9c6f533efeb2fe9d9b","amp;dn":"Cherie+and+Marie+Currie+-+Messin%5C%27+With+The+Boys+%281980%29+%5Bmp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9150fdf875dfd0aee642bd9c6f533efeb2fe9d9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,80,253,248,117,223,208,174,230,66,189,156,111,83,62,254,178,254,157,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
