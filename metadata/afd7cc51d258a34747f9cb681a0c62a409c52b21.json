They are the unmatched masters of the South African a cappella form known as isicathamiya or mbube, and this CD demonstrates their vocal prowess. The Zulu songs are ornamented by trills, yips, humming and tra-la-las and punctuated by the rhythmic clicks that are particular to the language. The English-language songs instruct and advise on the fine moral points of human relationships. While the mbube song form lends a certain similarity to the pieces, this group is so good that the music never seems redundant and the generous selection of 16 songs seems to go by too quickly. \n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Inkanyezi Nezazi\n[02] Diamonds On The Soles Of Her Shoes\t---&gt; Paul Simon &amp; Ladysmith Black Mambazo\n[03] Swing Low Sweet Chariot\t---&gt; Ladysmith Black Mambazo Featuring China Black\n[04] Knocking On Heaven's Door\t---&gt; Featuring Dolly Parton\n[05] Kangivumanga\n[06] Sisesiqhingini\n[07] Homeless\n[08] Vulani Amasango\n[09] Abezizwe Ngeke Bayiqede\n[10] Sibezwa Bekhuluma\n[11] Chain Gang\n[12] Yibolabafana\n[13] We Nhiziyo Yami\n[14] Sligugu Isiphambano\n[15] Rain, Rain, Beautiful Rain\n[16] Nigelekele\n[17] Wonke Amehlo Azacumbona\n[18] Akehlulek'ubaba\n[19] Liph' Iqinis\n[20] World In Union     \t---&gt; Ladysmith Black Mambazo Featuring PJ Powers\n\n\nTotal Play Time\t---&gt; 01h:17m:53s\nTotal File Size\t---&gt; 186mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t---&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t---&gt; I-Tunes v.9.0.0.70 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format---&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t---&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t---&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploade---&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t---&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t---&gt; World\nRelease Date\t---&gt; 21 September 1998\nRecord Company\t---&gt; Polygram Records\nArtists WebSite\t---&gt; \n\n&gt; http://www.mambazo.com \n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladysmith_Black_Mambazo \n&gt; http://www.thelyricarchive.com/artist/9342/Ladysmith-Black-Mambazo \n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afd7cc51d258a34747f9cb681a0c62a409c52b21","amp;dn":"%5B1998%5D+Best+Of+%28The+Star+%26The+Wiseman%29+-+Ladysmith+Black+Mambazo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afd7cc51d258a34747f9cb681a0c62a409c52b21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,215,204,81,210,88,163,71,71,249,203,104,26,12,98,164,9,197,43,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
