Note the DRM is removed when the file is added to Calibre. Adding DeDRM will not remove protection from files already loaded to Calibre.\n\nThe recommended method to obtain files on the PC is to use Amazon's Kindle PC app, after giving it your Amazon logon and password. You may also try taking the files off the Kindle through the USB port, but I haven't tried that.\n\nPB won't let me post a web address. For more info Google\n\nDeDRM: Ultimate Calibre DRM Removal Plugin for eBooks\n\nThere is also a Readme file packaged with the torrent.\n\nThis plugin is a 2013 version and I just used it to break DRM on a freshly purchased Ebook. Older plugins may not work any more. This file is fairly hard to find, and is being removed from file depositories. I don't know of any other torrents.\n\nPlease comment here, with any problems or pointers.
