And justifiably so. The album is filled with wonderfully crafted (if sometimes slight) and enjoyable songs. In hindsight, that appeared to be the goal of this project--to have a good time. There are no superstar trappings here. All songwriting credits are attributed to the Traveling Wilburys. In fact, real names are not to be found anywhere on the album.\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Handle with care                                     [03:20]\n02.Dirty world                                          [03:30]\n03.Rattled                                              [02:59]\n04.Last night                                           [03:51]\n05.Not alone any more                                   [03:25]\n06.Congratulations                                      [03:30]\n07.Heading for the light                                [03:37]\n08.Margarita                                            [03:17]\n09.Tweeter and the monkey man                           [05:28]\n10.End of the line                                      [03:30]\n11.Maxine                                               [02:49]\n12.Like A ship                                          [03:31]\n____\n\n42:47 min\n 70,2 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
