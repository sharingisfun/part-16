Bringing together leading specialists in the region to address this gap, this volume focuses on the question of Muslim identity in the contemporary Balkans. With the exception of the Bosnians, all of the Muslim communities of the former Yugoslavia are examined--the Sandzak, Kosovo and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM)--as well as those of Greece, Bulgaria, and Albania.\n\nCombining a multidisciplinary approach not often found in studies of the Balkans with an accessible and readable format, this volume offers a detailed look at the religious, ethnic, and national identities of the Balkan Muslims and their relationships with the states in which they live","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42437c625e85c8f86098389b27fc99d1d0037ac0","amp;dn":"Muslim+Identity+and+the+Balkan+State","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42437c625e85c8f86098389b27fc99d1d0037ac0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,67,124,98,94,133,200,248,96,152,56,155,39,252,153,209,208,3,122,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
