It is the group's fourth album in the Alive series\nand first release under Kiss Records and Sanctuary Records. The album featured three of the original members of Kiss\n(Peter Criss, Paul Stanley, and Gene Simmons). Ace Frehley once again left the band and the concert featured for the first time\na replacement musician, Tommy Thayer, dressed as Ace Frehley's &quot;Spaceman&quot;.\n\nBack in 2000, Kiss was to release the original Alive IV (Featuring the original re-united lineup) but, due to label politics\nand contracts, it was not to be. Even with the artwork being revealed[1] and &quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot; (from Alive IV)\nbeing added to the Kiss Box Set, the album was shelved. The band then moved labels from Universal/Island to Sanctuary Music\nand they released Alive IV - Kiss Symphony. However the original Alive IV was indeed released when the band released the box set\nof all past Alive albums entitled Kiss Alive! 1975-2000 in 2006. The album is not called Alive IV, but rather ALIVE:\nThe Millennium Concert.\n\nThe members of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra who accompanied Kiss during this performance wore makeup that mimicked\nthe band members. At the same time they also wore tuxedos.\n\n\n\nDISC ONE:\n\nThe KISS SYMPHONY STORY\n\n- A documentary about the making of the Melbourne shows containing backstage\nand rehearsal footage as well as interviews with all the band members.\n\n- Act 3 with The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra\n\n&quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;\n&quot;King of the Night Time World&quot;\n&quot;Do You Love Me&quot;\n&quot;Great Expectations&quot;\n&quot;Shout It Out Loud&quot;\n&quot;God of Thunder&quot;\n&quot;Love Gun&quot;\n&quot;I Was Made For Loving You&quot;\n&quot;Black Diamond&quot;\n&quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot;\n\n\nDISC TWO:\n\nAct One: Kiss\n\n&quot;Deuce&quot; (Gene Simmons)\n&quot;Strutter&quot; (Paul Stanley, Simmons)\n&quot;Let Me Go, Rock 'n' Roll&quot; (Stanley, Simmons)\n&quot;Lick It Up&quot; (Vinnie Vincent, Stanley)\n&quot;Calling Dr. Love&quot; (Simmons)\n&quot;Psycho Circus&quot; (Stanley, Curtis Cuomo)\n\nAct Two: Kiss with The Melbourne Symphony Ensemble\n\n&quot;Beth&quot; (Peter Criss, Stan Penridge, Bob Ezrin)\n&quot;Forever&quot; (Stanley, Michael Bolton)\n&quot;Goin' Blind&quot; (Simmons, Stephen Coronel)\n&quot;Sure Know Something&quot; (Stanley, Vini Poncia)\n&quot;Shandi&quot; (Stanley, Poncia)\n\n\nAct Three: Kiss with The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra\n\n&quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; (Stanley, Ezrin)\n&quot;King of the Night Time World&quot; (Stanley, Ezrin, Kim Fowley, Mark Anthony)\n&quot;Do You Love Me?&quot; (Stanley, Ezrin, Fowley)\n&quot;Shout It Out Loud&quot; (Stanley, Simmons, Ezrin)\n&quot;God of Thunder&quot; (Stanley)\n&quot;Love Gun&quot; (Stanley)\n&quot;Black Diamond&quot; (Stanley)\n&quot;Great Expectations&quot; (Simmons, Ezrin)\nfeaturing the Australian Children's Choir\n&quot;I Was Made for Lovin' You&quot; (Stanley, Desmond Child, Poncia)\n&quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot; (Stanley, Simmons)\n\nPersonnel\n\nPaul Stanley - rhythm guitar, lead vocals; acoustic guitar\nGene Simmons - bass guitar, lead vocals; acoustic bass\nTommy Thayer - lead guitar, backing vocals; acoustic guitar\nPeter Criss - drums, lead and backing vocals\n\nwith\n\nThe Melbourne Symphony Orchestra\nMark Opitz - Producer\nTony Wall - Engineer\nDavid Campbell - Composer\n\n\n\n\n\nDVD ONE:\n\nGeneral\nComplete name : C:\\Users\\KiSS-Symphony II._Title_01_01.vob\nFormat : MPEG-PS\nFile size : 4.26 GiB\nDuration : 1h 34mn\nOverall bit rate : 6 443 Kbps\n\nVideo #224\nID : 224 (0xE0)\nFormat : MPEG Video\nFormat version : Version 2\nFormat profile : Main@Main\nFormat settings, BVOP : Yes\nFormat settings, Matrix : Default\nDuration : 1h 34mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 3 909 Kbps\nNominal bit rate : 6 000 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 2.35:1\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nStandard : PAL\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Interlaced\nScan order : Top Field First\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.377\nStream size : 2.58 GiB (61%)\n\nAudio #128\nID : 128 (0x80)\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nDuration : 1h 34mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nStream size : 303 MiB (7%)\n\nAudio #129\nID : 129 (0x81)\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nDuration : 1h 34mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nStream size : 303 MiB (7%)\n\nAudio #138\nID : 138 (0x8A)\nFormat : DTS\nFormat/Info : Digital Theater Systems\nDuration : 1h 34mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 1 510 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 24 bits\nStream size : 1 021 MiB (23%)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7273535d851e05c519fae0bac5efe97a62882b83","amp;dn":"KiSS+-+Symphony+I.II.%282003%29-2DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7273535d851e05c519fae0bac5efe97a62882b83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,115,83,93,133,30,5,197,25,250,224,186,197,239,233,122,98,136,43,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
