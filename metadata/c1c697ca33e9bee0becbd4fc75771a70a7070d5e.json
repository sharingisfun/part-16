Sorry it took so long, but I was skeptical of the quality and reconverted it several times with different settings and had the same outcome. To me, many scenes seemed grainy or out of focus as compared to Part 1, and I'm not sure if that's because this was filmed using 3D equipment or what. It did help a lot to watch it from a distance from the TV. You'll notice what I'm talking about if you stand closer. Also, most of the movie is shot with dark scenes, and this does not help viewing with Active 3D glasses that tend to &quot;tint&quot; the image. I have yet to view it on a Passive set like LG's TVs to see if it's a lot brighter, but I would guess it is. My honest take on the film is that given the opportunity to have a mind-blowing 3D experience, being filmed in 3D, this movie fails to take full advantage unlike it's counter parts Avatar and Dark of the Moon. See what you think...\n\nSource: 3D Bluray Disk\n\nVideo: Encoded in H264 with a variable bit rate into a half side-by-side image\n\nAudio: DTS-HD 5.1 English\n\nSubtitles: English\n\nContainer/Extension: MKV\n\nYou do need 3D equipment to view this. I.E. a 3D TV that can display a side-by-side (stereoscopic) image in 3D, 3D glasses, and a mediaplayer that can play the MKV file and stream it to your TV.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1c697ca33e9bee0becbd4fc75771a70a7070d5e","amp;dn":"Harry+Potter+and+the+Deathly+Hollows+Part+2+3D+SBS.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1c697ca33e9bee0becbd4fc75771a70a7070d5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,198,151,202,51,233,190,224,190,203,212,252,117,119,26,112,167,7,13,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
