It was an enormous chart success internationally, spending seven weeks at number one in the United States' Billboard Hot 100, sixteen consecutive weeks at number one on the UK Singles Chart (the longest in British chart history), and nine weeks atop the RPM singles chart in Canada.\n\nThe record won a Grammy Award for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television at the Grammy Awards of 1992, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Song. Subsequently, the song has been covered by numerous singers around the world.\n\nThe song ranked at #16 on Billboard's All Time Top 100.\n\nThe idea of a song to promote the movie Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves came late in the making of the film. Michael Kamen, had originally wanted the song to be as if it were Maid Marian singing it to Robin Hood. He offered it to Kate Bush, Annie Lennox and Lisa Stansfield but they all turned it down. David Kerschenbaum of Morgan Creek Records invited Adams ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ whom he had worked with in the early 1980s at A&amp;M Records ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ to write the song based on the score from Kamen. Initially, Adams was to write the lyrics for another artist to perform, but it was decided that he should perform the song after writing it with Waking up the Neighbours producer Mutt Lange. The pair recorded the song in Mayfair Studios in London.\n\nOddly, neither Kamen nor the film company were happy with the song and tried at length to have Adams change it due to Adams and Lange writing an entirely different melody to the theme, but Adams refused. As a result, the song ended up buried at the very end of the film credits. The last laugh was had when the song entered most of the charts in the world at number 1 and stayed there for an unprecedented amount of time.\n\nThe song is credited to Adams, Lange, and Kamen, and is played over the film's credits. A&amp;M Records were at first reluctant to have the song appear on the film soundtrack, which was released through Morgan Creek, but the success of the record benefited both companies.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63b56d9a54bb35c3198b4703dec154ba58cac91f","amp;dn":"Bryan+Adams+-+%28Everything+I+Do%29+I+Do+For+You","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63b56d9a54bb35c3198b4703dec154ba58cac91f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,181,109,154,84,187,53,195,25,139,71,3,222,193,84,186,88,202,201,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
