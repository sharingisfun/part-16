To circumvent this process, ISOs of all the newer Language discs (v6.0) need to be used with SafeDisc4Hider to mask the use of a phantom drive program.\n\n\n\nSpanish (Latin America) Level 3 is one of them and requires version 2.1 of TRS application. It will not run under earlier versions of the application (e.g. v2.0).\n\nIf you have older language ISOs, you need to install the older version of TRS application as well (e.g. 2.0), and use that for the older versions.\n\n\n\nIf you are Mac User:\n\n1.  and run Tiger - install 2.1.4.1A using classic installer (NOT OSX INSTALLER)\n2.  and run Leopard - you have to use Windows ;-( (Desktop Parallels will do it)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:937bf490b3ed39bc7083e5ad34f6d81db04e859d","amp;dn":"Rosetta+Stone+V2+-+Spanish+%28Latin+America%29+-+Level+3b+WinMac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"937bf490b3ed39bc7083e5ad34f6d81db04e859d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,123,244,144,179,237,57,188,112,131,229,173,52,246,216,29,176,78,133,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
