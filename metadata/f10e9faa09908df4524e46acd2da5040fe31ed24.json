Genetically Modified foods are a part of the Eugenics operation  (mass murder) going on to kill most of humanity, and that is something not mentioned in this film. In other words, the documentary is very conservative in it's presentation. For example, GMO is -not- a result of greed for money; it exists for the sole purpose of killing you.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease do YOUR part and SEED this film...\n\nAnd tell your friends, family and co-workers about it !!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f10e9faa09908df4524e46acd2da5040fe31ed24","amp;dn":"The+World+According+to+Monsanto+%282008%29+--+High+Quality","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f10e9faa09908df4524e46acd2da5040fe31ed24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,14,159,170,9,144,141,244,82,78,70,172,210,218,80,64,254,49,237,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
