Far from just being expressed by the extreme right wing, the anti-immigrant trend has entered the mainstream. German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a gathering of young members of her conservative Christian Democratic Union party this weekend that multiculturalism has utterly failed. A recent German poll found 13 percent of Germans would welcome the arrival of a new &quot;FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼hrer,&quot; and more than a third of Germans feel the country is &quot;overrun by foreigners.&quot; We speak to the world-renowned philosopher Slavoj Zizek, who has the been called &quot;the Elvis of cultural theory.&quot; [includes rush transcript]\n\n[url=http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2010/10/18/part_iislavoj_zizek_far_right_and_anti_immigrant_politicians_on_the_rise_in_europe][b]Web Exclusive, Part II: Slavoj Zizek: Far Right and Anti-Immigrant Politicians on the Rise in Europe[/b][/url]\n\n[url=http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2010/10/18/part_iislavoj_zizek_far_right_and_anti_immigrant_politicians_on_the_rise_in_europe][img]http://www.democracynow.org/images/blog_posts/54/19254/zizek-p2.jpg[/img][/url] &lt;--- Click to watch online video for this segment \n\nSlavoj Zizek is a Slovenian philosopher, psychoanalyst and cultural theorist.

It brings with it the threat of far more savage austerity measures, cuts in benefits, diminishing health and education services and more precarious employment. [b]The left faces the difficult task of emphasizing that we are dealing with political economyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that there is nothing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“naturalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in such a crisis, that the existing global economic system relies on a series of political decisions[/b]ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½while simultaneously being fully aware that, insofar as we remain within the capitalist system, the violation of its rules effectively causes economic breakdown, since the system obeys a pseudo-natural logic of its own. So, although we are clearly entering a new phase of enhanced exploitation, rendered easier by the conditions of the global market (outsourcing, etc.), we should also bear in mind that this is imposed by the functioning of the system itself, always on the brink of financial collapse.\n\nIt would thus be futile merely to hope that the ongoing crisis will be limited and that European capitalism will continue to guarantee a relatively high standard of living for a growing number of people. It would indeed be a strange radical politics, whose main hope is that circumstances will continue to render it inoperative and marginal. It is against such reasoning that one has to read BadiouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s motto, [i]mieux vaut un dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sastre quÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢un dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªtre[/i]: better a disaster than a non-being; one has to take the risk of fidelity to an Event, even if the Event ends up in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“obscure disasterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. The best indicator of the leftÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lack of trust in itself today is its fear of crisis. A true left takes a crisis seriously, without illusions. Its basic insight is that, although crises are painful and dangerous, they are inevitable, and that they are the terrain on which battles have to be waged and won. Which is why today, more than ever, Mao ZedongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s old motto is pertinent: [i]Everything under heaven is in utter chaos; the situation is excellent[/i].\n\nThere is no lack of anti-capitalists today. We are even witnessing an overload of critiques of capitalismÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s horrors: newspaper investigations, tv reports and best-selling books abound on companies polluting our environment, corrupt bankers who continue to get fat bonuses while their firms are saved by public money, sweatshops where children work overtime. There is, however, a catch to all this criticism, ruthless as it may appear: [b]what is as a rule not questioned is the liberal-democratic framework within which these excesses should be fought[/b]. The goal, explicit or implied, is to regulate capitalismÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½through the pressure of the media, parliamentary inquiries, harsher laws, honest police investigationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½[b]but never to question the liberal-democratic institutional mechanisms of the bourgeois state of law[/b]. This remains the sacred cow, which even the most radical forms of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ethical anti-capitalismÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the Porto Allegre World Social Forum, the Seattle movementÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½do not dare to touch.[/quote]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60447b8cd2863aaf5b0d61f07c3814d07a115ad5","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now%21+Oct+18+2010%3A+Slavoj+Zizek%3A+Far+Right+and+Anti-Imm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60447b8cd2863aaf5b0d61f07c3814d07a115ad5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,68,123,140,210,134,58,175,91,13,97,240,124,56,20,208,122,17,90,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
