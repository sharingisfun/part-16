Metastatic lung cancer is responsible for more than ninety percent of lung cancer related deaths. However, relatively little progress has been made in understanding the process of lung cancer metastasis. The two main aims of this book are a) to introduce clinical aspects to basic scientists and basic molecular and cellular concepts to clinical investigators, in order to promote collaboration and foster much needed translational research; and b) to introduce new and emerging concepts and approaches in metastasis research to lung cancer research community at large.\n\nIn this attempt, the book will cover a broad spectrum of subjects ranging from the current trends in the clinical management of the metastatic disease, to the systems biology approach for gaining insights into the mechanisms of metastasis. Some of the subjects covered will include; defining basic hallmarks of a metastatic cell, the concept of tumor stem cells, epithelial-mesenchymal transitions, evasion of immune-surveillance, tumor-stromal interactions, angiogenesis, molecular imaging and biomarker discovery.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2b8d042a40e3a6d70b8f4019c441fd508cf2ad0","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2009%5D+Lung+Cancer+Metastasis%2C+Novel+Biological+Mechanisms","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2b8d042a40e3a6d70b8f4019c441fd508cf2ad0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,184,208,66,164,14,58,109,112,184,244,1,156,68,31,213,8,207,42,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
