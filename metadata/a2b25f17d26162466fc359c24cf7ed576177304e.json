The audiophile jazz label Mosaic Records issued The Complete Vogue Recordings/The Black Lion Sessions on vinyl initially, later releasing the title as a slightly expanded three-CD package. Chronologically, the earlier of the two sets consists of the Vogue recordings from June 7, 1954. The Black Lion sides are divided between a second batch of solo works as well as a trio session -- featuring Al McKibbon (bass) and Art Blakey (drums) -- both of which were cut on November 11, 1971. The nine sides cut for the Parisian Vogue label are supposedly Monk's very first solo studio recordings. Each of these pieces aptly capture the angular frolic that defines a Thelonious Monk performance.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2b25f17d26162466fc359c24cf7ed576177304e","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Black+Lion+%2F+Vogue+Recordings+Of+Thelonious+Monk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2b25f17d26162466fc359c24cf7ed576177304e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,178,95,23,210,97,98,70,111,195,89,194,76,247,237,87,97,119,48,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
