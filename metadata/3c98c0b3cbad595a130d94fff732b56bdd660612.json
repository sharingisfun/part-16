The enemy unit had battle tanks and 150 well-trained, well-equipped, and well-commanded soldiers. The Green Berets stopped the enemy advance, then fought them until only a handful of Iraqi survivors finally fled the battlefield. \nIn the process, the Nine One encountered hordes of news media and at the peak of the fight, a US Navy F-14 dropped a 500-pound bomb into the middle of a group of supporting Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, killing and wounding dozens. This is the never-before-told, unsanitized story of the fight for the crossroads at Debecka, Iraq, and a unique inside look at a Special Forces A-team as it recruits and organizes, trains for combat, and eventually fights a battle against a huge opposing force in Iraq.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c98c0b3cbad595a130d94fff732b56bdd660612","amp;dn":"Roughneck+Nine-One","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c98c0b3cbad595a130d94fff732b56bdd660612","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,152,192,179,203,173,89,90,19,13,148,255,247,50,181,107,221,102,6,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
