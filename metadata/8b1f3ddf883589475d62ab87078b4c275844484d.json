The Earl of\nWynwood was far too reckless to handle a sophisticated\nwoman like Viviana Alessandri. And the beautiful opera\nsinger was far too famous to make a suitable wife for\nWynwood.\n\nTwice, she wagered with her heart. Crushed by Wynwood's\nrefusal to marry, Viviana offered her hand to another, a\nwealthy count. But fate has a way of playing with lovers'\nhearts -- and passion has a way of setting them on fire.\n\n\nTwo Little Lies (MacLachlan Family #3)\nby Liz Carlyle\nISBN: 0743496108\n(ISBN13: 9780743496100)\nFormat: EPUB\nLanguage: EN\nPages: 568 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b1f3ddf883589475d62ab87078b4c275844484d","amp;dn":"Two+Little+Lies+%28MacLachlan+Family+%233%29+by+Liz+Carlyle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b1f3ddf883589475d62ab87078b4c275844484d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,31,61,223,136,53,137,71,93,98,171,135,7,139,76,39,88,68,72,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
