Hashim (InTech, 2012).pdf\r\n\r\nIn the last few years, Nanoparticles and their applications dramatically diverted science in the direction of brand new philosophy. The properties of many conventional materials changed when formed from nanoparticles. Nanoparticles have a greater surface area per weight than larger particles which causes them to be more reactive and effective than other molecules. In this book, we (InTech publisher, editor and authors) have invested a lot of effort to include 25 most advanced technology chapters. The book is organised into three well-heeled parts. We would like to invite all Nanotechnology scientists to read and share the knowledge and contents of this book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5850de2e85cd5dcd6d6ba12024c9d18e61b9337a","amp;dn":"Smart+Nanoparticles+Technology+-+Abbass+A.+Hashim","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5850de2e85cd5dcd6d6ba12024c9d18e61b9337a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,80,222,46,133,205,93,205,109,107,161,32,36,201,209,142,97,185,51,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
