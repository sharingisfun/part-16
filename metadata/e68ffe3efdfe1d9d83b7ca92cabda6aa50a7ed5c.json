In 1996, he had been diagnosed with testicular cancer, which spread to his lungs, abdomen and brain, and was only given a 40 percent chance of living. This disrupted his career, but his success on his return prompted elements in the media to accuse him of doping. In light of the revelations made by the USADA investigation in 2012, the passages about doping in the book are doubtful.\n\nThe book covers his story from childhood to the 1999 Tour, and the birth of his first child.[2] [3][4] A subsequent autobiographical instalment, entitled Every Second Counts and also with Sally Jenkins as co-author, continues the narrative until his 2003 Tour victory\n\nFormat: Pdf\n\nLanguage: English\n\nThis torrent doesn't provide anything exceptional.Books in it are easily available in Internet. So I am grateful to those uploader ,whom I don't know in person and the real credit goes to them.\n\nOne last request,try to buy books instead of downloading,if conditions permit you.Otherwise,the art of writing books will fade away in course of time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e68ffe3efdfe1d9d83b7ca92cabda6aa50a7ed5c","amp;dn":"It%27s+Not+About+the+Bike%3A+My+Journey+Back+to+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e68ffe3efdfe1d9d83b7ca92cabda6aa50a7ed5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,143,254,62,253,254,29,157,131,183,202,146,202,189,166,170,80,167,237,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
