Before I started to put a serious effort into beefing up my Christian Music collection, I spent a great deal of my time with bootlegs.\n\nFor those that might not know what a bootleg is, it's a live recording, usually made by a fan in attendance.  And from my perspective anyway, bootlegs have always given me an opportunity to get a feel for what it might be like to be at some of these concerts I couldn't attend, or perhaps remind me of what it was like to be at concert I actually attended in person.\n\nAnd I've always preferred a nice audience recording over something like a soundboard, or finely polished matrix.  With a good audience recording, there is a warmth that almost puts you there in the seat right next to the Taper doing the recording.  So you're left feeling like you were a part of the overall experience.\n\nWith this Casting Crowns bootleg in particular, I wouldn't call it a very good audience recording.  Truthfully, I would rate it on the low end of the quality scale.  It's rather muffled and sounds like the Taper didn't have his recording device elevated high enough in the air.  Nor does it sound like he put much of an effort into amplifying the talking between songs, or editing the sound levels after the fact so instruments like the guitar become more prevalent.  Yet it is still a very nice addition to my collection.  And after having listened to it a few times already, it left me feeling a part of that Casting Crowns concert which took place a mere eleven days ago (April 3rd) at the Independence Events Center in Independence Missouri.\n \nINDIE: Amos Lee.
