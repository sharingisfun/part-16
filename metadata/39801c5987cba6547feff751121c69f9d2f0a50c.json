The study\n of forensic science involves the analysis and interpretation of evidence for use in a court of\n law. Unlike &quot;pure&quot; disciplines, forensics is an applied science that uses scientific principles\n to meet specific goals. \n\nMany of the principles and techniques used by experts are incorporated into Forensic Science\n Experiments. Ideal for middle and high school students, this new full-color volume features\n 20 experiments that will help students get a firm grasp on concepts in the field of forensic\n science. Each experiment is a self-contained unit with its own further resources, tips for the\n teacher, and links to the National Science Education Standards. This resource allows students \nto think independently and build on their own base of science knowledge. \n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39801c5987cba6547feff751121c69f9d2f0a50c","amp;dn":"Forensic+Science+Experiments+%28Facts+on+File+Science+Experiments%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39801c5987cba6547feff751121c69f9d2f0a50c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,128,28,89,135,203,166,84,127,239,247,81,18,28,105,249,210,240,165,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
