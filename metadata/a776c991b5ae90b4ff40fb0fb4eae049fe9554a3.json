It is possible to install both of them (and later choose which one to use) or just one of them.\n\n- Cheats. \n\n- IMPORTANT!: To be able to make a single DVD-5, every video has been deleted (this edition is not thought for single player, though it works too). \n\n\nTo play with other people in L.A.N. the server has to create the match and the client has to press the &quot;F10&quot; key to open the console and type the command &quot;open&quot; and the server's I.P. (for example: open 5.124.75.84).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a776c991b5ae90b4ff40fb0fb4eae049fe9554a3","amp;dn":"Unreal+Tournament+3+2.1+%28online%2Foffline%29+%28English%2FSpanish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a776c991b5ae90b4ff40fb0fb4eae049fe9554a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,118,201,145,181,174,144,180,255,64,251,15,180,234,224,73,254,149,84,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
