When the 50-year-old policies and entrenched injustices of apartheid were finally overthrown in 1994, Nelson Mandelas new government began rebuilding a nation badly in need of racial unity. So the world was watching when South Africa played host to the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Though they had only one non-white player, the South African Springboks gained supporters of all colors as they made an improbable run into the final match where they beat the heavily favored New Zealand team. When Mandela himself marched to the center of the pitch cloaked in a Springbok jersey and shook hands with the captain of the South African team, two nations became one. Oscar winner Morgan Freeman and director Cliff Bestall will tell the emotional story of that cornerstone moment and what it meant to South Africas healing process. \n\n \n\n Cast\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n                 \n      Release notes     \n                 \n      \n\n Enjoy!\n\n\n      \n           \n     Greetings    \n           \n      \n\n\nNTX aAF FiCO HNR CiNEFiLE AEN HUMANiSM\n\n\n      \n           \n      Details     \n           \n      \n\n\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 351 MiB\nDuration                         : 51mn 58s\nOverall bit rate                 : 944 Kbps\nWriting application              : Nandub v1.0rc2\nWriting library                  : Nandub build 1852/release\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 51mn 58s\nBit rate                         : 808 Kbps\nWidth                            : 592 pixels\nHeight                           : 320 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.850\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nResolution                       : 8 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.178\nStream size                      : 300 MiB (86%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 51mn 58s\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 123 Kbps\nMinimum bit rate                 : 40.0 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 45.9 MiB (13%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 172 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.95 \nEncoding settings                : -m s -V 6 -q 3 -lowpass 16 --vbr-old -b 40","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1957feea8ee80c4baba09d8cdbd853823981b84c","amp;dn":"ESPN.30.For.30.The.16th.Man.2010.DVDRip.XViD-SPRiNTER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1957feea8ee80c4baba09d8cdbd853823981b84c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,87,254,234,142,232,12,75,171,160,157,140,219,216,83,130,57,129,184,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
