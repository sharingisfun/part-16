There is even an appearance by one of the original drivers, Brock Yates, who is now an editor for Car &amp; Driver Magazine and makes an amusing appearance as the MC, explaining how the race goes. JJ McClure (Burt Reynolds) and his strange friend, Victor (Dom Delouse) adopt a personality of two paramedics driving a patient cross country. Apparently this worked in the actual race one year.\n\n  Starring: Burt Reynolds, Dom DeLuise, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Roger Moore, Jamie Farr, Adrienne Barbeau, Terry Bradshaw, Jackie Chan, Bert Convy, Farrah Fawcett, Peter Fonda.\n\n  Directed by: Hal Needham.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length:  1hr. 36min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 688 x  368\n\n  Frame Rate: 23fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d0f82bddda3b4dd1dbbbb5f4931063fe757f03c","amp;dn":"The+Cannonball+Run+%281981%29+%28Burt+Reynolds%2C+Dom+DeLuise%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d0f82bddda3b4dd1dbbbb5f4931063fe757f03c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,15,130,189,221,163,180,221,29,187,187,95,73,49,6,63,231,87,240,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
