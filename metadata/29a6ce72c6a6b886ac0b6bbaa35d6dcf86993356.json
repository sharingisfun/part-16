Full Descriptionhimself definitively from the shackles that had bound him for years. Admittedly those shackles, being front man for Genesis, one of the most fascinating and consistently creative prog-rock bands of the early '70s, were hardly severe. But they were a constraint nonetheless. (How often could Peter take some fan screaming &quot;Suppers Ready&quot; when trying to debut new material?) Finally, with a substantial body of solo material (four albums, three of them titled PETER GABRIEL), Gabriel was ready to put the ghost of Genesis to rest. \n\nAnd while he did drive a stake through his art-rock past, Gabriel's incendiary stage presence could not be distinguished. Luckily the live set captured here, which draws heavily from the SECURITY album, is consistently first rate and involving. Not content just to breath fresh life into road-weary veterans like &quot;D.I.Y&quot; or &quot;Solsbury Hill,&quot; Gabriel reaches for new emotional heights on stellar versions of &quot;San Jacinto,&quot; &quot;Biko&quot; and &quot;And Through The Wire.&quot; As a bonus for completists PLAYS LIVE also contains the ultra-rare &quot;I Go Swimming.&quot; Overall an excellent portrait of Gabriel's live show. \n\nThe complete package of the former Genesis lead singer's first solo live album from 1983. This is the complete edition of the show with 4 tracks not included on the single U.S. Edition: &quot;The Rhythm of The Heat&quot;, &quot;Not One Of Us&quot;, &quot;Intruder&quot; and &quot;On The Air&quot;. \n\nRecorded in 1982. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://open.tracker.thepiratebay.se/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://open.tracker.thepiratebay.se/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29a6ce72c6a6b886ac0b6bbaa35d6dcf86993356","amp;dn":"Peter+Gabriel+-+Plays+Live+%28EAC+FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29a6ce72c6a6b886ac0b6bbaa35d6dcf86993356","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,166,206,114,198,166,184,134,172,11,107,186,163,93,109,207,134,153,51,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
