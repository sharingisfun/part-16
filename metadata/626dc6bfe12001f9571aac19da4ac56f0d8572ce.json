The Brazilian-oriented set consists of eight Mulligan originals (including &quot;Tema Pra Jobim,&quot; which finds him switching to piano, and &quot;Willow Tree&quot;) and three other numbers, with &quot;Wave&quot; being the only standard. Duboc sings well, although her voice never sticks in one's mind, and Mulligan has short solos and mostly sticks to the background; they are joined by a couple of Brazilian rhythm sections. Pleasant music that mostly stands out as a historical curiosity in Gerry Mulligan's discography. Ã‚Â´\n\nTrack list:\n\n1. Paraiso       \t5:35\t\n2. No Rio\t        4:08\t\n3.
