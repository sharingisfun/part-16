After fixing them, I realized it would be in dereliction of duty to not provide them in a compilation for others.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, these are the complete, non-game-ripped versions of the Half-Life 1, Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2 Episodes 1 and 2, Portal, and The Orange Box soundtracks. it was a pain in the ass tagging all these, but I think it paid off. :)\n\nAs you may notice, some of the HL1 songs are on the HL2 soundtrack as well (albeit with different names) -- songs' alternate names are included in the title tag.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e29e970018c1fffa8d0a0c3e956ec87bb77799df","amp;dn":"Half-Life%2C+Half-Life+2+%5B%2B+Episodes%5D%2C+Portal%2C+and+The+Orange+Box+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e29e970018c1fffa8d0a0c3e956ec87bb77799df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,158,151,0,24,193,255,250,141,10,12,62,149,110,200,123,183,119,153,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
