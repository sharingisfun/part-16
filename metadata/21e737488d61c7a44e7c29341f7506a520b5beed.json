From the sacred stone tablets of this culture, many of the teachings of the earliest inventors, philosophers and biblical scholars once thought mythical, are now known to be true. \n\nWhere did these Anunaki come from? Sitien says and NASA scientists concur, that there may be a mysterious 10th member to our solar system: The planet the Sumerians called, Nibiru.\n\nIntroduced by Dean Stockwell who played Al Calavicci &quot;The Observer&quot; in the TV show &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;.\n\nMore info: http://imdb.com/title/tt0412200/\n\nAVI File Details\n==========================================================================================\nName.........: Phenomenon - The Lost Archives (1998) Genesis Revisited (46m14s) ConRes.avi\nFilesize.....: 675 MB (or 691,974 KB or 708,581,376 bytes)\nRuntime......: 00:46:14 (83,125 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1844 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: ac3 (0x2000) Dolby Laboratories, Inc\nAudio Bitrate: 192 kb/s (96/ch, stereo) CBR \nFrame Size...: 720x480 (1.50:1) [=3:2]\nRipper ......: p2P2p\n\nEnjoy! :)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracyresearch.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracyresearch.org&lt;/a&gt; (Forums, Wiki, Blogs) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969&lt;/a&gt; (Educational Tracker)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21e737488d61c7a44e7c29341f7506a520b5beed","amp;dn":"Phenomenon+-+The+Lost+Archives+%281998%29+Genesis+Revisited+%2846m14s%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21e737488d61c7a44e7c29341f7506a520b5beed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,231,55,72,141,97,199,164,78,124,41,52,31,117,6,165,32,181,190,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
