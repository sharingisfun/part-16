The black-and-white series, published by Fantagraphics Books, ran for six issues from April 1986 to June 1987. A final 'special' issue was published in December 1988.\n\nThe series' titular character is a detective who has humorous adventures inspired by film noir and stereotypical 1950s lounge culture. Llewellyn has a sidekick who goes by the name of Ernie Hoyle. The series' police sergeant is called 'Red' Hoerring. The series' visual style is influenced by lowbrow art.\n\nThe story 'The Nightmare' from Lloyd Llewellyn #6 foreshadowed the approach of Clowes's next comic, Eightball, by breaking the conventions of the series' crime setting and turning to social satire.\n\nEarly issues of Eightball included several additional Lloyd Llewellyn episodes. The character also made various cameo appearances in other Eightball stories.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b70cc350bf16caa195e2a4e1662504e334858b4","amp;dn":"Daniel+Clowes+-+Lloyd+Llewellyn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b70cc350bf16caa195e2a4e1662504e334858b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,112,204,53,11,241,108,170,25,94,42,78,22,98,80,78,51,72,88,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
