Productions in 2010 - English narration\n\n\nInformation\n------------------------------\n\nNazi Collaborators \nThis series looks at the many people who chose to collaborate with the Nazis. It is at times, uncomfortable viewing, but it's also totally absorbing too. It's a simple question. &quot;How could they have done it?&quot; How could anyone have collaborated with the Nazis? And yet so many did. From Pierre Laval in France to Chaim Rumkowski, who ran the Jewish administration in the Lodz ghetto, from Quisling to the IRA, from the 1600 Belgians who served in the SS to the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem - all worked with the Nazis. Many of these people did what they did out of the best intentions. Others felt they had no choice. Others still had darker and more disturbing motives. This series will draw upon WMR Productions unrivalled 4000 hours of archive, much of which has never been seen before. At the heart of this 13 part series lies one uneasy question. If you had faced what these people had faced, might you have done the same thing - and danced with the devil? \n\n\n\n8)  The Grand Mufti \nOf those individuals who have been accused of collaboration with Hitler and the Nazis during World War two, it is perhaps Mohammed Amin al-Husseini who is the most controversial of all. Debate still rages to this day as to whether his apparent pact with the National Socialists was a purely individual act or whether al-Husseini was a mouthpiece for the wider, fanatically anti-Jewish Arab world. That he was sympathetic to the Nazi cause is in no doubt. But what were his motives? And how much did he really support the Nazis intentions towards the Jews? This film takes a detailed look at the life of al-Husseini and explores the true nature of his collaboration with the Nazi's. It examines the legacy of his actions during World War Two and explores the impact of his influence on the Middle East in the 21st century.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img254/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img254/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img195/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img195/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img132/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img132/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img593/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img593/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img607/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img607/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img685/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img685/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img132/1696/nazicollaboratorsscreenq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img132/1696/nazicollaboratorsscreenq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img96/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img96/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img528/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img528/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1915 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 52.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 13\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by Harry65\n * Thanks to llambert\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.worldmediarights.com/index.php?hidAction=episode&amp;eid=517&amp;name=Chaim_Rumkowski&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.worldmediarights.com/index.php?hidAction=episode&amp;eid=517&amp;name=Chaim_Rumkowski&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afec5b7adf28a674a29a7722e259555f6f0c3a59","amp;dn":"Nazi+Collaborators+08of13+The+Grand+Mufti+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afec5b7adf28a674a29a7722e259555f6f0c3a59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,236,91,122,223,40,166,116,162,154,119,34,226,89,85,95,111,12,58,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
