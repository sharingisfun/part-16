This practical guide describes how to plan, design and install solar electric systems in a manner that is hands-on, graphic and technically complete. Highly illustrated chapters cover: -\tsolar energy basics -\tcomponents of solar electric systems (modules, batteries, regulators, inverters and appliances) -\tinstallation practice -\tdetails on planning and servicing systems -\twater pumping -\trefrigeration -\tvillage electrification This is the must-have guide for electric technicians and designers, development workers, and anyone who wants to install their own off-grid system.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b52fc7497abd8441c69d26ed941d3ff5f59d71d8","amp;dn":"Stand-alone+Solar+Electric+Systems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b52fc7497abd8441c69d26ed941d3ff5f59d71d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,47,199,73,122,189,132,65,198,157,38,237,148,29,63,245,245,157,113,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
