After a military coup dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢etat  in 2006, arrests for lÃƒÂ¨se-majestÃƒÂ© , defamation law designed to protect ThailandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s King, Queen, and Crown Prince, skyrocketed along with censorship of more than one million webpages. Another military coup in 2014 continues to use Article 112 as a blunt instrument and more than 100 prosecutions and jailings have followed.\n\tTruth on Trial in Thailand traces the 110-year trajectory of these law which the military junta says offend national security. Defamation aspects also appear in laws on sedition and treason, the press and cinema, anti-communism, contempt of court, insulting of religion, as well as libel.\n\tAuthoritarian structures and urges, particularly the military, still drive politics in Thailand; the long-term effects of defamation law has skewed the way that Thai society approaches and perceives &quot;truth.&quot;\n\tLÃƒÂ¨se-majestÃƒÂ© accused face a 96% conviction rate with no opportunity for bail. All prosecutions are now tried by military courts-martial in which there is no right to a denfence attorney and which decision cannot be appealed. More than 500 ordinary citizens have been detained by the junta for reeducation and many have fled into exile and sought refugee status. Arrests are occurring for Facebook postings and failing to remove comments from websites.\n\tNo elections are planned and no dissent is tolerated. Is Thailand the new Burma?\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.scribd.com/doc/258861713/Truth-on-Trial-in-Thailand-David-Streckfuss&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.scribd.com/doc/258861713/Truth-on-Trial-in-Thailand-David-Streckfuss&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bookos-z1.org/book/999708/5c0af5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bookos-z1.org/book/999708/5c0af5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bookos-z1.org/book/1130186/e58bc0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bookos-z1.org/book/1130186/e58bc0&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6aa64ecd9b221ecf5e5f6f7ef9377954cd9ef9de","amp;dn":"Truth+on+Trial+in+Thailand+-+David+Streckfuss","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6aa64ecd9b221ecf5e5f6f7ef9377954cd9ef9de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,166,78,205,155,34,30,207,94,95,111,126,249,55,121,84,205,158,249,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
