Release: 1994. W/Covers.\n\n\nLate in 1964, George Jones switched labels, moving from United Artists to Musicor. Musicor was already home to pop hitmaker Gene Pitney (&quot;Town Without Pity,&quot; &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence&quot;), and label execs quickly struck on the idea of pairing the two successful artists. The duo's first session produced the hit &quot;I've Got Five Dollars And It's Saturday Night.&quot; Although the duo only charted once more with a cover of the Kershaw Brothers' &quot;Louisiana Man,&quot; the pairing lasted long enough to complete two albums. During the same year, Pitney recorded a solo country album. Bear Family's GEORGE JONES &amp; GENE PITNEY contains all three of these albums in their entirety.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b02cb4457be6902b7dde97f8a07b7ac027ec539","amp;dn":"George+Jones+%26amp%3B+Gene+Pitney+-+Bear+Family+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b02cb4457be6902b7dde97f8a07b7ac027ec539","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,2,203,68,87,190,105,2,183,221,233,127,138,7,183,172,2,126,197,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
