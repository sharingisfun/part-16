Free, Reliable Wi-Fi Security, 100% Security Through a VPN. This impenetrable tunnel prevents snoopers and hackers from viewing your email, instant messages, credit card information or anything else you send over a wireless network. Which means you remain anonymous and protect your privacy. Sure, public Wi-Fi hotspots are great. After all, what would life be without checking your email each morning at your favorite cafe? But while youâ€™re enjoying your latte and a bagel, some hacker might be accessing your passwords, credit card numbers, sensitive company data and much more. And standard antivirus software wonâ€™t protect you. Thatâ€™s why AnchorFree is pleased to offer Hotspot Shield.\r\n\r\nHotspot Shield security software is free to download, employs the latest VPN technology, and is easy to install and use. This security software keeps your Internet connection secure at public hotspots, home or work.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\nâ€¢ Unblock websites â€“ Unblock YouTube, unblockunblock Twitter or any sites at school, the library or your office with Hotspot Shield VPN. You can bypass filters and firewalls set by your network administrator to gain access to your favorite content anytime and anywhere you want.\r\nâ€¢ Anonymous surfing â€“ Because of privacy and security concerns, you may want to browse the Web anonymously. Hotspot Shield Free VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between your computer and our servers to let you conduct your online activities (visit the websites you want, make online transactions, download files) anonymously, without being tracked and spied upon.\r\nâ€¢ Hide your IP address â€“ The Internet is infested with spammers, snoopers, and hackers. They silently monitor your online activities and steal your sensitive data like credit card information and passwords when you least expect it. If you connect with Hotspot Shield enabled, you get a new US IP address to mask your actual IP address and surf the Internet anonymously.\r\nâ€¢ Private and secure browsing â€“ VPN offers an enhanced level of security online. Whenever you connect to the Internet through Hotspot Shield VPN, your data, including passwords, financial transactions and instant messages, is secured and encrypted. Additionally, all of your personal information is hidden from web spies.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ WiFi security â€“ If you browse the Internet at a public WiFi hotspot like the Starbuck in your town, anyone on that network can monitor and spy on your web activities. Irrespective of where you connect from, a personal VPN secures your web browsing session and keeps your private data considerably more private.\r\nâ€¢ Malware protection â€“ Hotspot Shield VPN will alert you if you visit sites that are known to contain malware, and then block the site. It detects and blocks more than 3.5 million malicious, phishing and spam sites from infecting your device.\r\nâ€¢ Data compression for iPhone and Android â€“ Concerned with the rising data charges? Hotspot Shield VPN technology compresses the web content that passes through our secure servers so that you can get twice as much content for the same bandwidth cost. The savings can be huge if you are roaming while traveling abroad in countries such as Switzerland or Japan that have high data charges. It also comes with a useful feature that allows you to track the data savings generated in each browsing session","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1df254f716acf74450fbe5d8d8ff5f7a19deb295","amp;dn":"Hotspot.Shield.VPN.Elite.5.20.22","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1df254f716acf74450fbe5d8d8ff5f7a19deb295","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,242,84,247,22,172,247,68,80,251,229,216,216,255,95,122,25,222,178,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
