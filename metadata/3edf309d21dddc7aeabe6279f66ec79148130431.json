The concise treatment makes this ideal for a one-semester course. The exercises in this manuscript are numerous and of a very high quality. Interesting historical tidbits are scattered throughout the text, many of which will be new to most readers. The main prerequisites are basic undergraduate courses in real analysis, linear algebra, and point set topology.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3edf309d21dddc7aeabe6279f66ec79148130431","amp;dn":"Elementary+Functional+Analysis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3edf309d21dddc7aeabe6279f66ec79148130431","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,223,48,157,33,221,220,122,234,190,98,121,246,110,199,145,72,19,4,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
