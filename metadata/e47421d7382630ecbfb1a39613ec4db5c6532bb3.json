So it comes as little surprise that these are matched to the kind of music you'd expect to hear at clubs and parties where such pickup lines form the backbone of conversation, and where bouncers are on hand to make sure that no one with the wrong haircut or shirt intrudes on the fun. This is a more curious and eclectic brew than many such discs, though, mixing sexy female spoken and sung vocals; jack-in-the-box samples, echoes, and effects; perky brass with vaguely Latin and swing jazz overtones; smoky cocktail lounge passages; the odd bit that wouldn't sound out of place on dub records; and more conventional modern dance percussion. When Caribbean accents are introduced in the brass, guitar, and rhythm, it's more akin to postmodern music to sip piÃƒÂ±a coladas to on beach cruises. It's clever, and the riffs are modestly catchy. There's also the nagging feeling that the music is aimed toward listeners who desperately aspire to nouveau riche chicness, but want to feel somewhat hip about doing so. The CD concludes with the Trailermen Go to Rio edit of &quot;Would You...&quot; and the Dreamcatcher's Mix of one of the disc's other tracks, &quot;Straight to...Number One.&quot; (2.5/5)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e47421d7382630ecbfb1a39613ec4db5c6532bb3","amp;dn":"Touch+and+Go+-+I+Find+You+Very+Attractive+%5B1999%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e47421d7382630ecbfb1a39613ec4db5c6532bb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,116,33,215,56,38,48,236,191,177,163,150,19,236,77,181,198,83,43,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
