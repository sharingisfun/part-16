The Brooklyn Side, produced by Eric &quot;Roscoe&quot; Ambel, is fairly bursting with dead-on character studies exploring the realities and quiet desperation of rural Southern life, from the darkly humorous (&quot;Sunday Sports,&quot; about a family man who finds that watching TV in his underwear is &quot;the only way to get away from everything else&quot; in his life) to the poignant (&quot;Welfare Music,&quot; a depiction of the struggles facing a young single mother). The band also possesses a wickedly comic edge, as evidenced by &quot;Idiot's Revenge&quot; (a diatribe against alt rock rhetoric), &quot;1000 Dollar Car&quot; (a eulogy for a used automobile), and the flamethrowing single &quot;Radar Gun&quot; (the tale of a sadistic, ticket-happy traffic cop).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12579f3b3e2e07ac2eaa05523bbfca67832d6e78","amp;dn":"Bottle+Rockets+-+1995+-+The+Brooklyn+Side++%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12579f3b3e2e07ac2eaa05523bbfca67832d6e78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,87,159,59,62,46,7,172,46,170,5,82,59,191,202,103,131,45,110,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
