Kyle masterfully argues that guns have played a fascinating, indispensable, and often under-appreciated role in our national story. Kyle carefully chose ten guns to help tell his story, including the American long rifle, Colt .45 revolver, Winchester rifle, .38 police handgun, and the M-16 rifle platform Kyle himself used as a SEAL. This is also the story of how American innovation, creativity, and industrial genius has constantly pushed technologyÃÂ²Ãâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½and U.S. powerÃÂ²Ãâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½forward.
