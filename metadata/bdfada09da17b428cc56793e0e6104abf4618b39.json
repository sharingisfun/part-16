Krell hates humans. They left him scarred and undesirable to females. He's lived a lonely existence in his home world because of their brutality. So he's angry when he's ordered to interrogate the captured human. She's the enemy, a soldier from Earth. He'll show her the same mercy they showed him. None. Cyan didn't expect to survive her mission against the Markus Models but she's stunned and elated to be confronted by cyborgs. The past and present collide, however, when she sees Krell. He's part of a dangerous secret from another life-and he's also completely irresistible. Krell is certain Cyan can't be trusted. He's determined to keep her at a distance...but Cyan is just as determined to get the big, sexy cyborg into her bed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdfada09da17b428cc56793e0e6104abf4618b39","amp;dn":"Taunting+Krell.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdfada09da17b428cc56793e0e6104abf4618b39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,250,218,9,218,23,180,40,204,86,121,62,14,97,4,171,244,97,139,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
