With nowhere else to turn, Troy\n\ndrives to where his aunt lives in the desert. There, he\n\nmeets with his Aunt Hilda (Barbara Hershey), a supporting\n\ncast of crazy fun old ladies, and Bobby (Ron Perlman), a\n\nkind of wise cowboy, all of whom make it easier for Troy\n\nto find the place within to deal with his grief and move\n\nforward, and help open Troy's eyes that his pain is not\n\nunique. In the Process, Troy also learns the Difference\n\nbetween &quot;true love&quot; and &quot;love at first sight&quot;\n\n\n\nRon Perlman: Bobby\n\nBarbara Hershey: Hilda\n\nDaniel Gillies: Troy Harper\n\nBitsie Tulloch: Corrine\n\nSergio Candido: Office Worker\n\nMason Alexander: Jill\n\nMauri Bernstein: Elaine\n\nLinda Burden-Williams: Mrs. Toliver\n\nKim Cifuentes: Native Girl\n\nPat Crawford Brown: Sheila Daley: Laura\n\nTakayo Fischer: Tina Kazawa\n\nSuzanne Ford: Joyce\n\nMatt Gismondi: Trucker at Cafe Counter\n\nIrma P.
