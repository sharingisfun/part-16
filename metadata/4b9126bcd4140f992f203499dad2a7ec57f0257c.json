The last track, Not Guilty is a forgery, with jarring edits back and forth between the two stereo mixes, to create a different version... for what purpose, I'm not sure. There is, however, a well-done composite of all of the bits of You Know My Name from both the mono single and the stereo Anthology version. Overall, a very nice-sounding disc.\n\n01 Leave My Kitten Alone (take 4 f/s, take 5 mono)\n02 If You've Got Trouble (take 1, true stereo)\n03 I'm Looking Through You (take 1)\n04 Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da + Christmas Time (Is Here Again) (Sessions mix)\n05 Strawberry Fields Forever (edit of takes 7 &amp; 26)\n06 A Day In The Life (RS 4)\n07 A Day In The Life (RS 5)\n08 A Day In The Life (RS 6)\n09 A Day In The Life (RS 9 + edit piece 9).flac\n10 You Know My Name (Look Up The Number) (composite)\n11 I Am The Walrus (take 17 RM 4 acetate)\n12 The Fool On The Hill (demo take 1)\n13 Magical Mystery Tour (take 9 mono acetate)\n14 Lady Madonna (take 4)\n15 Across The Universe (take 8 RM2 'Hums Wild' mix acetate)\n16 Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except Me And My Monkey (take 12 RM 5 acetate)\n17 Yer Blues (RM 6 acetate)\n18 Back In The USSR (take 6 RM 1 acetate)\n19 Birthday (take 1 RM 1 acetate)\n20 Helter Skelter (take 21 RM 1 acetate)\n21 Dear Prudence (alternate mix)\n22 Not Guilty (forgery - re-edited version)\n\nffp file and artwork are incuded.\n\nPlease preserve the lossless quality of this material.\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\nRemasters Workshop\nRMW 057","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b9126bcd4140f992f203499dad2a7ec57f0257c","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Backyard+Spool+%28Remastered+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b9126bcd4140f992f203499dad2a7ec57f0257c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,145,38,188,212,20,15,153,47,32,52,153,218,210,167,236,87,240,37,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
