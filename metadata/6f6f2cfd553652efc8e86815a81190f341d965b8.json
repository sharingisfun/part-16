Adams' framework begins with the good rather than the right, and with excellence rather than usefulness. He argues that loving the excellent, of which adoring God is a clear example, is the most fundamental aspect of a life well lived. Developing his original and detailed theory, Adams contends that devotion, the sacred, grace, martyrdom, worship, vocation, faith, and other concepts drawn from religious ethics have been sorely overlooked in moral philosophy and can enrich the texture of ethical thought.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f6f2cfd553652efc8e86815a81190f341d965b8","amp;dn":"Finite+and+Infinite+Goods%3A+A+Framework+for+Ethics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f6f2cfd553652efc8e86815a81190f341d965b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,111,44,253,85,54,82,239,200,232,104,21,168,17,144,243,65,217,101,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
