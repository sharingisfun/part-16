Performances at Max's Kansas City, Trude HellerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and Reno Sweeney in New York City soon brought them a cult following, and it was at the latter venue that Ahmet ErtegÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼n, founder and chairman of Atlantic Records, saw them and offered a recording contract which led to the release, in 1975, of their first album under the new line-up, The Manhattan Transfer. The album included the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first hit single, the gospel tune &quot;Operator&quot;.\n\nThe group soon did very well in Europe, where the next two albums, Coming Out and Pastiche, brought a string of top 10 hits. One was a revival of Wayne Shanklin's &quot;Chanson D'Amour&quot;, which went to number one in the UK in 1977 but failed to chart in the US. These hits were followed by a live album, The Manhattan Transfer Live. It was recorded in the UK and captured the group's great popularity in Europe at that time. Immediately after that album was recorded, in 1978, Laurel MassÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© was badly injured in an auto accident and was replaced by Cheryl Bentyne. The line-up has remained the same since then.\nTheir next recording, Extensions, earned The Manhattan Transfer their second US pop hit: &quot;Twilight Zone/Twilight Tone&quot;, written by Alan Paul and Jay Graydon as a tribute to the 1960sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ CBS television series created by Rod Serling.\nIn the UK the group is also known for its guest appearances on The Two Ronnies.\nExtensions featured a cover of Weather Report's &quot;Birdland&quot;, with lyrics by Jon Hendricks, the piece that has become The Manhattan Transfer's signature tune. One of the most popular jazz recordings of 1980, &quot;Birdland&quot; brought The Transfer its first Grammy award (Best Jazz Fusion Performance, Vocal or Instrumental), and the award for Best Arrangement For Voices.\nIn 1981, The Manhattan Transfer made music history by becoming the first group to win Grammys in both pop and jazz categories in the same year. &quot;Boy from New York City&quot; (a cover of the 1965 hit by The Ad Libs), which broke into the top 10 on the pop charts, won them the award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and &quot;Until I Met You (Corner Pocket)&quot; earned them a Grammy for Best Jazz Performance, Duo or Group. Both of these songs appeared on the group's fifth album, Mecca for Moderns.\nIn 1982, the group won another Grammy, for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Duo or Group, for its rendition of the classic ode-to-the-road, &quot;Route 66&quot;. The song appeared on the soundtrack to the Burt Reynolds film Sharky's Machine.\nSeptember 1983 brought Bodies and Souls, whose urban-contemporary flavor resulted in two R&amp;B-chart singles ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the #2 &quot;Spice of Life&quot; (also #40 on the pop chart) and the ballad &quot;Mystery&quot; (#80 R&amp;B, #102 Pop). Despite its disappointing chart performance, &quot;Mystery&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with powerful lead vocals by Siegel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ has become one of the group's best-loved songs. Hauser has called it the group's biggest turntable (radio airplay) hit. Anita Baker covered it on her breakout album, Rapture.\nThe Manhattan Transfer's next set, Vocalese (1985) was a great critical success[citation needed]. Vocalese received twelve Grammy nominations ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ at the time making it second only to Michael Jackson's Thriller as the most nominated single album ever. The Transfer won in two categories: Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Duo or Group, and Best Arrangement for Voices. This was followed by a live recording of many of these songs titled Live. This concert was also released on VHS and DVD.\nFor Brasil, the group headed south to work with Brazilian songwriters and musicians Ivan Lins, Milton Nascimento, Djavan and Gilberto Gil. Brasil won a Grammy for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.\nIn 1991 the group released The Offbeat of Avenues on the Sony label featuring original tunes written or co-written by members of the quartet. Their efforts brought them their 10th Grammy for &quot;Sassy.&quot; This was followed by the release of their holiday CD titled The Christmas Album.\nSwitching back to the Atlantic label, they recorded Tonin' (a collection of R&amp;B and pop hits from the 1960s which was rather unsuccessful), The Manhattan Transfer Meets Tubby the Tuba (a children's album), Man-Tora! Live in Tokyo (a concert recorded in 1986 in Japan), and their 1997 album Swing covered 1930s-era swing music. Their final album for the Atlantic label was The Spirit of St. Louis (2000), dedicated to the music of Louis Armstrong.\n\nThe group was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\nThe group changed to the Telarc Label in 2003 to release Couldn't Be Hotter, a live performance capturing many of the songs from The Spirit of St. Louis.\nIn 2004, the group released Vibrate. This is another one of their ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpasticheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ CDs, blending original tunes with older ones, pop, jazz, funk, etc.\nThey also released (in Japan originally and shortly later in the US) An Acapella Christmas in 2005.\n2006 saw the release of The Symphony Sessions, a collection of the group's hits re-arranged for symphonies and pops orchestras, and The Definitive Pop Collection, a two-disc collection of the group's tunes which would lead one to believe they were only from the group's pop repertoire. Instead, it's a hodge-podge of the group's songs under their Atlantic label contract.\nIn late 2006, the Transfer's second concert DVD was released: The Christmas Concert, and was aired by PBS in select locations.\nIn 2006, they recorded their first original title song for a movie, &quot;Trail of the Screaming Forehead.&quot;\n\nCurrent Manhattan Transfer Tour Lineup:\n\nThe Manhattan Transfer: Alan Paul, Janis Siegel, Tim Hauser, Cheryl Bentyne\n\nThe Manhattan Transfer Band:\n\nYaron Gershovsky - Musical Director, Keyboards, and Piano, Adam Hawley - Lead and Rhythm Guitar, Steve Hass - Drums and Percussion, Gary Wicks- Bass Guitar\n\n\nSince 1975 they have released 24 of their own albums and have appeared as guest artists on dozens of recordings. All have solo careers, with Janis's being the most prolific.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
