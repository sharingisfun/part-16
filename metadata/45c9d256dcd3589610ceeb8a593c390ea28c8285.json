Other stories featured Batman's friends and foes.  The additional 4 issues of a quarterly title allowed DC to, along with the 4 existent monthly titles, publish a Batman comic every week of the year.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45c9d256dcd3589610ceeb8a593c390ea28c8285","amp;dn":"The+Batman+Chronicles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45c9d256dcd3589610ceeb8a593c390ea28c8285","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,201,210,86,220,211,88,150,16,206,235,138,89,60,57,14,162,140,130,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
