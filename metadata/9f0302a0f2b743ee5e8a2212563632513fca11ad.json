A double-LP set, At Fillmore East was taken from recordings of two gigs at the famous New York venue, on the 12th and 13th of March 1971. It consisted of mainly new material, the vast majority of which were blues covers (Blind Willie McTell's &quot;Statesboro Blues&quot;, Elmore James' &quot;One Way Out&quot;, T. Bone Walker's &quot;Stormy Monday&quot; and Willie Cobbs' &quot;You Don't Love Me&quot;), all given fantastic, creative arrangements. Two old songs were present, &quot;Whipping Post&quot; from their first album and &quot;In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed&quot; from their second, and a new band original, the instrumental &quot;Hot 'Lanta&quot;..\nAt Fillmore East perfectly showcased the band's fusion of blues, jazz and rock, balancing the three genres perfectly. It took their instrumental abilities to the fore, with a strong focus on jams. Of particular note, this is the album where Duane Allman's reputation as one of the greatest slide guitarists of all time was founded. His slide playing here sounded like nothing that had come before, taking the style of guitar into new, exciting and previously unheard of territories. Not to forget fellow guitarist Dickey Betts, whose solo on &quot;Whipping Post&quot; is particularly worthy of praise. Guest musician Thom Doucette also contributed harmonica to three songs. The backing of Gregg Allman's organ, Berry Oakley's roving bass, and the twin drum sets of Butch Trucks and Jai Johanny Johanson made for an exquisite jam-band sound that has never been bettered. \nThe album was a massive success, and today is considered the band's greatest achievement in their long career, and also one of the greatest live albums of all time.\n\nDisc One\n\n1.Statesboro Blues ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n2.Trouble No More ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43\n3.Don't Keep Me Wonderin' ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27\n4.Done Somebody Wrong ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:33\n5.Stormy Monday ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:48\n6.One Way Out ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:56\n7.In Memory of Elizabeth Reed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 13:04\n8.You Don't Love Me ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 19:24\n9.Midnight Rider  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:55&quot; \n\nDisc Two\n\n1.
