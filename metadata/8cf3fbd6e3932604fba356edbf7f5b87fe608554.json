The Sixth Doctor's era was marked by the decision of the BBC controller Michael Grade to put the series on an 18-month &quot;hiatus&quot; between seasons 22 and 23. Prior to its postponement, season 23 was well advanced with episodes already drafted, these were all dropped with the reconception of the season in mid 1985 in favor of a 14 episode story arc called The Trial of a Time Lord. Series 20 had 40 minute episodes versus the normal 20 that was used for the rest of the classic series. \n\nAll the DVD rips have the following specs:\nVideo: Container - MKV, Codec - h264 @ 872 kbps, Resolution - 640x480 (4:3 aspect ratio)\nAudio: AAC @ 128 kbps or MP3 @ 128 kbps (depending on the source). \n\nDoctor Who - 2107 - The Twin Dilemma - DVD Rip\n\nDoctor Who - 2201 - Attack of the Cybermen - DVD rip\nDoctor Who - 2202 - Vengeance on Varos - DVD rip\nDoctor Who - 2203 - The Mark of the Rani - DVD rip (i didn't rip these, the bitrate is a little low, around 700, but otherwise excellent).  \nDoctor Who - 2204 - The Two Doctors - DVD rip\nDoctor Who - 2205 - Timelash - DVD rip (ripped by the same person who did the Mark of Rani).\n\nDoctor Who - 2301 - The Trial of The Time Lord - The Mysterious Planet - DVD rip\nDoctor Who - 2302 - The Trial of The Time Lord - Mindwarp - DVD rip\nDoctor Who - 2303 - The Trial of The Time Lord - Terror of the Vervoids - DVD rip\nDoctor Who - 2304 - The Trial of The Time Lord - The Ultimate Foe - DVD rip\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cf3fbd6e3932604fba356edbf7f5b87fe608554","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+1984+-+1986+%286th+Doctor+-+Colin+Baker%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cf3fbd6e3932604fba356edbf7f5b87fe608554","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,243,251,214,227,147,38,4,251,163,86,237,191,127,91,135,254,96,133,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
