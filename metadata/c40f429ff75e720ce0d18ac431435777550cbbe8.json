Igor Stohl has selected 50 outstanding games from recent years and analyzed them in painstaking depth. Here he presents his findings to chess enthusiasts, who will find the games entertaining and the annotations both instructive and illuminating. Stohl is an outstanding theoretical expert, so the opening phase of each game reads like a lesson in the key strategic aspects of the opening played, with a critical survey of modern methods. The middlegame is dissected and the critical decisions subjected to scrutiny by an author who invites readers inside his laboratory to join him in his quest for the truth. The endgame phase, if reached, is handled with similar erudition, with insights into the grandmaster's approach to questions of technique. Following each game there is a discussion of the most important lessons to be learned from it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c40f429ff75e720ce0d18ac431435777550cbbe8","amp;dn":"Instructive+Modern+Chess+Masterpieces+%28Igor+Stohl%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c40f429ff75e720ce0d18ac431435777550cbbe8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,15,66,159,247,94,114,12,224,209,138,196,49,67,87,119,85,12,187,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
