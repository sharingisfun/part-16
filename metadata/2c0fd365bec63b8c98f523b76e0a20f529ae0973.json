To protect the kingdom from the merciless cult Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Dark ChurchÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which has murdered all heroes and knights you will have to hire dubious soldiers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and rescue jealous maidens who will follow you into combat as your groupies. Up to 10 heroes are deployed in tactical battles to take on the Dark Church with their special abilities. \nThe developers of Grotesque Tactics are deeply focused to bring across the fascination of the Strategy RPG genre known through more serious titles such as Heroes of Might and Magic, Jagged Alliance or KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bounty.\nOn the side Grotesque Tactics throws a lot of dialogues and a grand story in your face mimicking the whole RPG genre in a most humorous way including numerous side blows towards Oblivion, Final Fantasy or Lord of the Rings. Grotesque Tactics is funny with a great plot and gives you a tactical challenge to remember.\n\nFeatures:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ tactical turn-based battles with lively animation;\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ an ironic scenario with well-developed atmosphere, which RPG fans will be another thousand years to compose ballads;\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ huge, perfectly legible and very angry bosses;\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Contingency funny dialogues in the style of &quot;Monkey Island&quot;, by which a genre there is a new face.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Turn based tactical battles with humorous animations not seen in any RPG\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Distinctive party members such as the arrogant Holy Avatar, the blood thirsty Vampire Solitaire, the sweet but hot-tempered Angel Angelina and many more\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Gorgeous village landscapes and dark, sinister dungeons\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Scantily dressed maidens to be freed from the grasp of merciless monsters\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Enormous, highly detailed and very angry end bosses\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Classical RPG elements: quests, treasures, trade, leveling up and outÃ‚Â¬fitting a party of unique heroes\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Enjoyable multiple choice dialogues and conversation puzzles in the style of classic adventure games, such as Monkey Island or Maniac Mansion\n\n*In chess, a Grotesque is a problem or endgame study which features a particularly unlikely initial position, especially one in which White fights with a very small force against a much larger black army. Grotesques are generally intended to be humorous.\n\nInfo:\n[Multi-2 ENG/GER] English MANUAL\nYear: 2011 | PC | Eng/Ger | Developer: Silent Dreams | Publisher: Silent Dreams | 1.02 Gb\nGenre: Strategy / RPG\n\nWEBSEED support: YES\n\nChangelog: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://worthplaying.com/article/2011/5/27/patch/81598/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://worthplaying.com/article/2011/5/27/patch/81598/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nJust only &quot;THETA.nfo&quot; and &quot;!!Mreader.exe&quot; (nothing important)\nGrotesque-Tactics-EH-1.2.0.4-info-THETA.rar 83 KB\n\nMD5:\n74DBD758A074E61BA6ECC0A4C70B2A1D *Grotesque Tactics Evil Heroes 1.2.0.4 THETA.exe\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c0fd365bec63b8c98f523b76e0a20f529ae0973","amp;dn":"Grotesque+Tactics+Evil+Heroes+Premium+Edition+1.2.0.4+THETA+%5BENG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c0fd365bec63b8c98f523b76e0a20f529ae0973","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,15,211,101,190,198,59,140,152,245,35,183,110,10,32,245,41,174,9,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
