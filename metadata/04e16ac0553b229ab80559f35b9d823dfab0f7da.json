However, certain factors in the modern days have made the discovery of Truth even easier. First and foremost is the Freedom to preach and move around in these days. He writes:\n\n    &quot;Is it not strange that while we are free to preach Islam in the streets of London, it is not possible for us to do the same in the Holy Mecca! Not only has this Government given freedom to publish books and preach one's religion to one and all, but has also taken upon itself to help every sect by spreading the knowledge of modern sciences and arts. Thus, through education and training it has opened the eyes of a whole world.&quot; (p. 1)\n\n    Similarly the profusion of printing presses, has brought to light even the old scriptures 'buried in the earth' &quot;even the Vedas of the Hindus have come out dressed in new pages. In other words, it has been reborn, and the tales invented by the fools and the rabble have been exposed.&quot; (p. 2).\n\nThe Third means\n\n    &quot;is the opening of the channels of communications, the establishment of an efficient postal system, and the conveyance of books from far off countries to our land and vice versa. All these means, which, by the grace of God, have now been made available in our country, and from which we are freely benefiting, are instrumental in searching for the truth.&quot; (p. 2) .\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAn Overview of The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community:\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is a dynamic, fast growing international revival movement within Islam.
