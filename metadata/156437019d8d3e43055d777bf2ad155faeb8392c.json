The song is said to have been what jump started the career of songwriter Diane Warren and was the biggest hit recorded by the Motown family singing group.\n\nThe release of &quot;Rhythm of the Night&quot; coincided with the release of the Motown film, The Last Dragon, which featured the song as part of its soundtrack. The free publicity from the song on its soundtrack and in the movie itself helped boost its popularity. Eventually released as a single, the song produced DeBarge&amp;#039;s biggest success yet with the single reaching #3 on the Billboard Hot 100, #1 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, #1 on the US adult contemporary chart, and #4 in the UK singles chart - their only major hit single in the UK - going gold and boosting similar success for its parent album of the same name. The group&amp;#039;s music video of the song gained the group heavy rotation on MTV and BET and was actually the group&amp;#039;s first real music video starting a brief period where DeBarge became pop superstars.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:156437019d8d3e43055d777bf2ad155faeb8392c","amp;dn":"Debarge+-+Rhythm+Of+The+Night","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"156437019d8d3e43055d777bf2ad155faeb8392c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,100,55,1,157,141,62,67,5,93,119,123,242,173,21,95,174,184,57,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
