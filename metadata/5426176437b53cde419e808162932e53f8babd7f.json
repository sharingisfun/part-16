An ongoing series started the following year with the first three issues reprinting Marvel Comics Super Special #15.  The tales that follow presumably taking place during the apocryphal second five-year mission of Kirk and the Enterprise that would have been featured in the never-produced Star Trek: Phase II TV series. Marvel's license from Paramount prohibited them from utilizing concepts introduced in the original series, being restricted to only using the characters and concepts as they appeared in Star Trek: The Motion Picture. The series lasted a total of 18 issues, ending in 1981.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5426176437b53cde419e808162932e53f8babd7f","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+%28Marvel%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5426176437b53cde419e808162932e53f8babd7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,38,23,100,55,181,60,222,65,158,128,129,98,147,46,83,248,186,189,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
