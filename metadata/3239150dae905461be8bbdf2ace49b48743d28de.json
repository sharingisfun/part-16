The distance between these islands can be huge - literally hundreds or thousands of miles - but somehow, life made it there. \n\nIsolation does curious things - animals evolve and adapt in strange ways. Witness flesh-eating caterpillars, giant crabs capable of opening coconuts, geckos that can breed without any need of a male, frogs that have never been tadpoles... Beyond clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©d images of swaying palms and idyllic beaches, this is the real, immense and surprising South Pacific.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3239150dae905461be8bbdf2ace49b48743d28de","amp;dn":"South+Pacific+++%28BBC+2009+-+Part+1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3239150dae905461be8bbdf2ace49b48743d28de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,57,21,13,174,144,84,97,190,139,189,242,172,228,155,72,116,61,40,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
