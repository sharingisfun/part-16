A fuel system consisting of storage tanks, pumps,\nfilters, valves, fuel lines, metering devices, and monitoring\ndevices is designed and certified under strict Title 14 of the\nCode of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) guidelines. Each\nsystem must provide an uninterrupted flow of contaminantfree\nfuel regardless of the aircraftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attitude. Since fuel\nload can be a significant portion of the aircraftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s weight,\na sufficiently strong airframe must be designed. Varying\nfuel loads and shifts in weight during maneuvers must not\nnegatively affect control of the aircraft in flight.\nAircraft Fuel System ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a73c73bd6bba40639588eb807c9fe14d027f3b86","amp;dn":"Aircraft+Fuel+System+by+FAA.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a73c73bd6bba40639588eb807c9fe14d027f3b86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,60,115,189,107,186,64,99,149,136,235,128,124,159,225,77,2,127,59,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
