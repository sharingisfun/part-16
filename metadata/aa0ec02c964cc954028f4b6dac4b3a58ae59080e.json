The funked-up, get-down\nLittle Miss America, on which Sayce pushes his voice to the edge, and at the\nother end of the intensity scale is a diamond among other gems on the album:\nDaydream Tonight, a mid-tempo, slow-burning ballad delivered with passion and\ngiving off a hint of the piquancy of some of a young Lenny KravitzÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest,\nmost soulful moments. The album also includes a cover of the Automatic Man song\nMy Pearl. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI just love the song,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Sayce enthuses. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt's an amazing love song,\nbut it's really tuff. It makes me smile ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and my lady too. I wanted to bring my\nlove of funk and soul to this track, and it's so much fun to play. It's\nstrangely obscure, but hopefully not for long if we have anything to do with\nit!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nWith Peace Machine and now INNEREVOLUTION, Philip Sayce continues to write his\nown chapter in the long and continuing history of popular music. And itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s clear\nthat this gifted young musician has many more pages yet to write.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa0ec02c964cc954028f4b6dac4b3a58ae59080e","amp;dn":"Philip_Sayce-Innerevolution-2010-404","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa0ec02c964cc954028f4b6dac4b3a58ae59080e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,14,192,44,150,76,201,84,2,143,75,109,172,75,58,88,174,89,8,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
