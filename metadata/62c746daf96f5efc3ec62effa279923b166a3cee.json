This time three contemporary families live as their own forebears did. They must follow the social conventions of the time, but whether they're destined for luxury or poverty is determined by their family history, which is a nice touch. You just know the posh family (the Meadows) are going to end up in the working-class house but they take to the hardship well, even though daughter Saskia reveals, &quot;I thought we'd do chores when we were on camera but when you said cut, we'd go off, have a chat and a bit of food. This is a bit of a shock.&quot; The other families struggle for very different reasons. It seems that living history is a bit harsher than those sepia-tinted photos would have us believe.\n\n\n\n\n2)  1920s and 1930s \nThe Interwar years In this episode, the families are put through the mill as they experience family life during the Interwar years. They experience the highs of the &quot;roaring twenties&quot;, followed by the lows of the Great Depression and its catastrophic effect on British economy. The Taylor family lead a life of leisure in an upper class household, waited on by servants, a chauffeur and a nanny; but the good times are soon brought to an end with the Wall Street Crash. Living as a working class family, the Meadows start on a high with better pay and working conditions, but are soon forced to resort to desperate measures. Meanwhile, the Golding family are relieved to be relatively unscathed by the economic downturn and spend the era steadily improving their lot. That is, until Ian Golding is presented with some devastating truths about the 1930s lives his ancestors were forced to lead as Jews living in London's East End.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/1988/thefamilyscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/1988/thefamilyscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img195.imageshack.us/img195/8146/thefamilyscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img195.imageshack.us/img195/8146/thefamilyscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img210.imageshack.us/img210/3715/thefamilyscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img210.imageshack.us/img210/3715/thefamilyscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img254.imageshack.us/img254/4421/thefamilyscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img254.imageshack.us/img254/4421/thefamilyscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/1397/thefamilyscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/1397/thefamilyscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img705.imageshack.us/img705/2185/thefamilyscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img705.imageshack.us/img705/2185/thefamilyscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/4329/thefamilyscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/4329/thefamilyscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img440.imageshack.us/img440/3914/thefamilyscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img440.imageshack.us/img440/3914/thefamilyscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/6421/thefamilyscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/6421/thefamilyscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1619 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 5\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tvchoicemagazine.co.uk/interviewextra/phil-suzie-meadows-turn-back-time-family&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tvchoicemagazine.co.uk/interviewextra/phil-suzie-meadows-turn-back-time-family&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20High%20Street&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20High%20Street&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62c746daf96f5efc3ec62effa279923b166a3cee","amp;dn":"BBC+Turn+Back+Time+The+Family+2of5+1920s+and+1930s+PDTV+XviD+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62c746daf96f5efc3ec62effa279923b166a3cee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,199,70,218,249,111,94,252,62,198,46,255,162,121,146,59,22,106,60,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
