With its melding of hard-bop, bossa nova, and the blues, Una Mas is a prime example of the memorable vamps that Blue Note favored at the time.\n\nWith Una Mas, Dorham takes a few risks. Not every jazz musician that tries to infuse Latin rhythms is successful, and in retrospect, some efforts sound contrived. By contrast, Una Mas manages the fusion seamlessly, leaving a record notable for its insistent but not overpowering rhythm, and simple, powerful melodies. \n\nUna Mas is also notable as the first recorded appearance of the great tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson.\n\nThe catchy and suave title track is one of the most recognizable tunes in the Blue Note catalog, built on brilliant economy and using a simple two-note bounce with a tight, blue chorus. Herbie Hancock contributes a particularly sophisticated handling of the two-note theme by modifying the chords almost continuously, even as he remains tightly within the rhythmic framework. The lineup, rounded out by bassist Butch Warren\nand drummer Tony Williams (only 17 at the time) is as tight and swinging as they come.\n\nA classic and essential recording. Una Mas is an excellent groover.\n\n\n\n\nCD / 1999 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\n\nTrack Listing: \n1. Una Mas\n2. Straight Ahead \n3. Sao Paolo\n4.
