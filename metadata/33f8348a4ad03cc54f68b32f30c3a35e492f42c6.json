The colorful trombonist Buster Cooper (who was not featured in enough small group sessions through the years) seems to inspire Cobb; the rhythm section (organist Austin Mitchell, bassist George Duvivier and drummer Osie Johnson) proves a strong asset for this music. Four standards (three from the swing era plus Cobb's &quot;Smooth Sailing&quot;) alternate with a blues and a couple of up-tempo riff numbers. Arnett Cobb's solos are typically emotional and generally exciting during the fine set. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Chairmaine\n02 - Cobb's Mob\n03 - I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance with You\n04 - Let's Split\n05 - Blues Around Dusk\n06 - Smooth Sailing\n07 - (I'm Left With the) Blues in My Heart\n\nEnjoy and share!
