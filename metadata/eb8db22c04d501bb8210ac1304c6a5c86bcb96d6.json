But that was before she discovered the family secret, and that her hot crush, Archer Cross, is an agent for The Eye, a group bent on wiping Prodigium off the face of the earth.\nTurns out, SophieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a demon, one of only two in the worldÃ¢â‚¬â€the other being her father. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worse, she has powers that threaten the lives of everyone she loves. Which is precisely why Sophie decides she must go to London for the Removal, a dangerous procedure that will destroy her powers.\nBut once Sophie arrives she makes a shocking discovery. Her new friends? TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re demons too. Meaning someone is raising them in secret with creepy plans to use their powers, and probably not for good. Meanwhile, The Eye is set on hunting Sophie down, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re using Archer to do it. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not like she has feelings for him anymore. Does she?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb8db22c04d501bb8210ac1304c6a5c86bcb96d6","amp;dn":"Demonglass+-+Rachel+Hawkins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb8db22c04d501bb8210ac1304c6a5c86bcb96d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,141,178,44,4,213,1,187,130,16,172,19,4,198,165,200,107,203,150,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
