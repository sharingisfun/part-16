Here the focus is reversed with contemporary maps telling the story Ã¢â‚¬â€œ one that should be attractive to the widest audience as it is a unique approach complimenting what has gone before and providing something different for all interested in Antarctica.\n\nAbout the Authors\nRobert Clancy is a Member of Order of Australia (for Immunology as well as Historic Cartology). He has made about 6 trips to Antarctica, as both a research scientist and as a tour guide (to both the Antarctic Peninsula and Australian bases). He has been collecting maps of Antarctica since 1972.\nJohn Manning has had a long career from 1956 to 2004 in surveying, mapping and geodesy in Antarctica and remote areas of Australia. He has been closely involved in modern Australian mapping of the Antarctic since 1966..\nHenk Brolsma has had a professional career in surveying and mapping for more than 30 years in different parts of the world. Since 1994 , he has held the position of Mapping officer at the Australian Antarctic Division. In that role he has been in charge of the production of more than a hundred scale maps of the Australian Antarctic territory in East Antarctica.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface. . .. . . . . . . xiii\nList of unnumbered figures, and table . . .. . . xvii\nList of abbreviations and acronyms . . . . . . . . xix\nMap of Antarctica. . . . . . . . . . xxii\n1 Arctic and Antarctic regions are not poles apart . . . . . .. . . . 1\n2 Drivers of discovery . . . .. . . . . 31\n3 AntarcticaÃ¢â‚¬â€the concept: From Ptolemy to Cook . . . . . . . . . . 61\n4 AntarcticaÃ¢â‚¬â€the reality: From Cook to the International Geographical Congress . . . . . 89\n5 AntarcticaÃ¢â‚¬â€the heroic age: Heroes, legends, and land . . . . . . . . . . . . 129\n6 AntarcticaÃ¢â‚¬â€wings over the continent: From Wilkins to war. . . . . . . . . 173\n7 Antarctica 1940Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1960: A second world war and a new order of business 195\n8 Consolidation of political interest and national mapping programs (1950Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2010) . . . . . . . . 221\n9 Antarctic science comes of age: window on the world (1960Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2010) . . . . 251\n10 Atlas maps. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 271\nIndex . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 303","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e2f2bbcdfe9cf75eb0a006759dcad5461e2336d","amp;dn":"Mapping+Antarctica+-+A+Five+Hundred+Year+Record+of+Discovery+%28gn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e2f2bbcdfe9cf75eb0a006759dcad5461e2336d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,47,43,188,223,233,207,117,235,10,0,103,89,220,173,84,97,226,51,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
