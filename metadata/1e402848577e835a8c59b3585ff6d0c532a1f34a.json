Obviously it was Ramases (the artist / salesmen, not the egyptian Pharao) duty to tell us earthlings the truth about the universe, and what better way to do it then through music? ...\n\nThis is from the linernotes:\n \n\n&quot;This album is dedicated to the earth people who are unusual because they have begun to pause, look back, and wonder where they have come from and why, and where they are going to! \n\nThe earth is a living thing just as we are and has a soul as we do. You look at the heavens through a telescope. Reverse the telescope and you have a microscope through which (if powerful enough), you would see almost the same sight. (Electrons in orbit around their stars.) &quot;In my father's house there are many \nmansions&quot; (The Bible). \n\nWe are most probably existing on a molecule inside the material of, perhaps, a living thing in the next size up. \n\nThe rocket ship shape of churches probably dates back to Moses' visit to speak to God on the mountain and what he saw there.&quot;\n\n\nUhmm...yeah. \nThe tracklist further speaks of Ramases....visions. Thank the gods his musical visions were slightly more sane. Slightly.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Life Child \t  \t  \t\n2. Oh Mister \t  \t  \t\n3. And The Whole World \t  \t  \t\n4. Quasar One \t  \t  \t\n5. You're The Only One \t  \t  \t\n6. Earth People \t  \t  \t\n7. Molecular Delusions \t  \t  \t\n8. Balloon \t  \t  \t\n9. Dying Swan \t  \t  \t\n10. Year 2000 \t  \t  \t\n11. Jesus\n\n[320kbs]\n\nThe music is very very good tho; pop-psych clashes with acid drenched madness creating a superb album of hippy rock with moogs, sitars and guitars all the way. Arranged and played by 10cc (none other) which probably explains the technical quality of this, not to mention the great great music :D\n\nEnjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e402848577e835a8c59b3585ff6d0c532a1f34a","amp;dn":"Ramases+-+Space+Hymns+%28Mindblowing+UK+psychedelic+progrock+1971%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e402848577e835a8c59b3585ff6d0c532a1f34a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,64,40,72,87,126,131,90,140,89,179,88,95,246,208,197,50,161,243,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
