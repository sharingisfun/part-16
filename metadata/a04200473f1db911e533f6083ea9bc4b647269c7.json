Production duties were handled by Cox and previous Deerhunter producer Nicholas Vernhes. It was recorded at Rare Book Room Studios in Brooklyn, New York (which is ran by Vernhes.) The artwork features a photograph of Bradford Cox taken by Mick Rock, who has previously shot photographs for albums such as Raw Power, The Madcap Laughs, and Transformer. 4AD also launched a website, depicting an image of Cox in Manhattan's Central Park, similar to the artwork of his two previous releases, his face is obscured by a lens flare. The website lists the genre as &quot;Science Fiction.&quot;\n\nA demo of &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; was originally released on the third volume of the Bedroom Databank series that Cox had released on the Deerhunter blog last year. &quot;Te Amo,&quot; (originally known as &quot;Untitled&quot;) and &quot;Flagstaff&quot; had been appearing in live Atlas Sound sets for about a year.\n\n\n\nRelease\n\nThe album was announced on August 24th. Prior the album's release, more than half the album's songs were made officially available for streaming and/or download. &quot;Terra Incognita&quot; was the first track available to coincide with the album's announcement. &quot;Te Amo,&quot; &quot;Modern Aquatic Nightsongs,&quot; &quot;Ampifiers,&quot; &quot;The Shakes,&quot; &quot;Lightworks,&quot; &quot;Praying Man,&quot; and &quot;Flagstaff,&quot; all followed. Some were made exclusively available through websites such as the online retailer Amazon, radio station KEXP's blog and music blogs Gorilla vs. Bear and Fluxblog. &quot;Parallax&quot; will be the first official single from the album, released on the same day as the album.
