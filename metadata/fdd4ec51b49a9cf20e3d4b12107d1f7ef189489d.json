Surprisingly, the cognitive correlates of this essential component of human communication have received little attention. This book fills the gap by providing a model of the psychological processes involved in interpreting and understanding speech acts. The theory is framed in naturalistic terms and is supported by data on language development and on autism spectrum disorders. Mikhail Kissine does not presuppose any specific background and addresses a crucial pragmatic phenomenon from an interdisciplinary perspective. This is a valuable resource for academic researchers and graduate and undergraduate students in pragmatics, semantics, cognitive linguistics, psycholinguistics and philosophy of language.\n\nAddresses a crucial pragmatic phenomenon from an interdisciplinary perspective, which will appeal to linguists, philosophers, psychologists and cognitive scientists\nAvoids formalism and theory-specific terminology and does not presuppose any specific background\nAccessible to a wide range of scholars and suitable for advanced undergraduates and graduate students\n\nPUBLICATION PLANNED FOR: August 2014\nFORMAT: Paperback\nISBN: 9781107439665\nLENGTH: 208 pages\nDIMENSIONS: 229 x 152 mm\nCONTAINS: 3 b/w illus. \nAVAILABILITY: Not yet published - available from August 2014\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
