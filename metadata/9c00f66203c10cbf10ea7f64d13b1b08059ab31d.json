The biopic starred Richard Hatch as Jan Berry and Bruce Davison as Dean Torrence, with cameo appearances by Dick Clark, Wolfman Jack, Mike Love of the Beach Boys, and Bruce Johnston (who at that time was temporarily out of the Beach Boys), as well as Berry himself (near the end of the movie, he can be seen sitting in the audience, watching &quot;himself&quot; (Richard Hatch) perform onstage). The part of Jan &amp; Dean's band, Papa Doo Run Run, was played by themselves. Johnston and Berry had known each other since high school, and had played music together in Berry's garage in Bel AirÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½long before Jan &amp; Dean or the Beach Boys were formed. Following the release of the film, the duo made steps toward an official comeback that year, including touring with the Beach Boys.\n\nCast: \n\nPamela Bellwood - Annie\nEddie Benton  \t- Nancy\nArt Bradford  \t- Army Sergeant\nHank Brandt  \t- Mr. Torrence\nDavid Byrd  \t- Surgeon\nDick Clark  \t- Himself\nPriscilla Cory  - Linda\nJune Dayton  \t- Mrs. Berry\nFloy Dean  \t- Dr. Vivian Sheehan\nDenise Du Barry - Susan\nRichard Hatch  \t- Jan Barry\nBruce Johnston  - Himself\nNoah Keen  \t- Jim Arlett\nArt Koulias  \t- Freddie\nMike Love  \t- Himself\nVicki McLean  \t- Caroline\nInga Neilsen  \t- Kathy\nJames Oliver  \t- Engineer\nCharles Pitt  \t- Soldier\nLeonard Stone  \t- Herb Alpert\nSusan Sullivan  - Rainbow\nGeorge D.
