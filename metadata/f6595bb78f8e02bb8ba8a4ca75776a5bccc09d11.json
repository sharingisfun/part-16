Jonny seems to have effortlessly managed to capture a timeless feel for the seamy underbelly of life, making the darker side sound like the summer pulp fiction adventures of an outlaw on the run ... I mean really [!] a song entitled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSmoking TarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ opens the album.  With his rootsy classic rock jangles on songs like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStill Lonely,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ carrying a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSweet JaneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ riff that is guaranteed to roll over you all night long, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGolden YearsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which will bring actual chills to your skin; all of the other songs are just enough off their axis to raise a smile from the grave of Gram Parsons.\n\nThis is one great piece of work that is hanging out there brilliantly, just waiting for you to discover it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6595bb78f8e02bb8ba8a4ca75776a5bccc09d11","amp;dn":"Jonny+Kaplan+%26+the+Lazy+Stars...Seasons%282008%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6595bb78f8e02bb8ba8a4ca75776a5bccc09d11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,89,91,183,143,142,2,187,139,168,164,202,117,119,106,91,204,192,157,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
