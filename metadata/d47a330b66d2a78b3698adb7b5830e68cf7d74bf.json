This 216-page hardcover book features five yarns Ã¢â‚¬â€ all brand new with the exception of the aforementioned Ã¢â‚¬Å“Low Moon,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which is collected into book form for the first time. The new stories lead off with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Emily Says Hello,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a typically deadpan Jason tale of murder, revenge and sexual domination. Then, the wordless Ã¢â‚¬Å“&amp;Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ tells two tales at once: one about a skinny guy trying to steal enough money to save his ill mother, and the other about a fat guy murderously trying to woo his true love. The reason we follow these two parallel stories becomes obvious only on the very last page, in JasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inimitable genre-mashing style. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Early Film NoirÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ can best be described as The Postman Always Rings Twice meets Groundhog Day. But starring cavemen. And finally, Ã¢â‚¬Å“You Are HereÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ features alien kidnappings, space travel, and the pain and confusion of family ties, culminating in an enigmatic finale that rivals JasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest twists. Funny, poignant, and wry, Low Moon shows one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most acclaimed graphic novelists at the absolute peak of his powers. - See more at: http://www.fantagraphics.com/browse-shop/203-artists/325-jason/fantagraphics/1575-low-moon.html#sthash.DW0bhMiL.dpuf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d47a330b66d2a78b3698adb7b5830e68cf7d74bf","amp;dn":"Jason%3A+Low+Moon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d47a330b66d2a78b3698adb7b5830e68cf7d74bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,122,51,11,102,210,167,139,54,152,173,183,181,131,14,104,207,125,116,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
