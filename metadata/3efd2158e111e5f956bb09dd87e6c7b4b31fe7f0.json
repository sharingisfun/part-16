The clinic head, Dr. Stewart McIver, thinks that it would be good therapy for his patients to design and make new drapes for the library. Mrs. Karen McIver, who is neglected by her hardworking husband (and a bit unbalanced herself), wants to make her mark on the clinic, so she orders new drapes. Miss Inch, the business manager, who has been with the clinic longer than anyone, sees this as an intrusion into her territory, and she too orders drapes. All this puts everyone in a dither, as they fight over drapes and clinic politics. \n\nDirected by Vincente Minnelli. \n\nStarring Richard Widmark, Lauren Bacall.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3efd2158e111e5f956bb09dd87e6c7b4b31fe7f0","amp;dn":"The.Cobweb.1955.DVDrip.576p.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3efd2158e111e5f956bb09dd87e6c7b4b31fe7f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,253,33,88,225,17,229,249,86,187,9,221,135,230,199,180,179,31,231,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
