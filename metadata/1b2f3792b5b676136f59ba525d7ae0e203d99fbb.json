A review of the most useful applications from an industrial point of view is given. These applications include:\n\nnatural gas steam reforming,\nautothermal reforming,\nwater gas shift reaction,\ndecomposition of hydrogen sulphide, and\nalkanes dehydrogenation.\nThe final part is dedicated to the description of a pilot plant where the novel configuration was implemented at a semi-industrial scale.\n\nPlant engineers, researchers and postgraduate students will find Membrane Reactors for Hydrogen Production Processes a comprehensive guide to the state of the art of membrane reactor technology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b2f3792b5b676136f59ba525d7ae0e203d99fbb","amp;dn":"Membrane+Reactors+for+Hydrogen+Production+Processes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b2f3792b5b676136f59ba525d7ae0e203d99fbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,47,55,146,181,182,118,19,111,89,186,82,93,122,224,226,3,217,159,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
