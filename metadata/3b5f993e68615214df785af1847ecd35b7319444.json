And, as if those Tiger Beat heartthrobs werenâ€™t enough to pack the seats with screaming tween fans (and by seats, we mean living room couches, because this movie was straight to video) thereâ€™s also Bo Hopkins playing a grizzled older cop! The ultimate dreamy triple threat!\r\n\r\nIn Fever Lake, A.C. Slater and The Other Coreyâ„¢ are college kids, or possibly high school students, depending on what part of the film youâ€™re watching. They, a sex-crazed buddy, and some female teen-adults leave whatever kind of school it might be for a trip out to a cabin in an equally vague rural location, Fever Lake! Might it be the kind of cabin with a dark past that â€œnobody goes up to anymoreâ€? Might it be a town full of locals suspicious of their big city student-ish ways, despite the fact the city kids and the locals all dress, speak, and look pretty much the same? Might sacred Indian ground be a factor? Might fevers come into play in any way at any point? The answer to all these questions is yes, except, weirdly, for that last one about fevers. Seriously, thereâ€™s not a lot of â€œfeverâ€ stuff happening at Fever Lake.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s the kind of good clean old-fashioned horror movie the whole family can enjoy. To quote/paraphrase/blatantly rip off Christopher Walken, â€œWeâ€™ve got a Fever Lake, and the only cure is more Mike, Kevin, and Bill!â€\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nRiffTrax are comedy audio commentaries of movies, television programs and short films featuring Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K) comedians Michael J.
