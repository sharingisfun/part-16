In this tenth anniversary edition of The Nurture Assumption, Judith Harris has updated material throughout and provided a fresh introduction. Combining insights from psychology, sociology, anthropology, primatology, and evolutionary biology, she explains how and why the tendency of children to take cues from their peers works to their evolutionary advantage. This electrifying book explodes many of our unquestioned beliefs about children and parents and gives us a radically new view of childhood.\n\n480 pages\nPublisher: Free Press; Rev Upd edition (February 24, 2009)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1439101655\nISBN-13: 978-1439101650","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34a8254e9d1db27f7e0198e438e859465b260ab6","amp;dn":"The+Nurture+Assumption+%5B2nd+Ed%5D+%282009%29+by+Judith+Rich+Harris","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34a8254e9d1db27f7e0198e438e859465b260ab6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,168,37,78,157,29,178,127,126,1,152,228,56,232,89,70,91,38,10,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
