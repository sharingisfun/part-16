As you read, you will begin to unravel the marvels of coding for Firefox using the basics of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript and then later diving into XML User Interface Language (XUL) and the Cross Platform Component Object Model (XPCOM). The final goal is being able to create extensions that will allow you to customize Firefox to your heartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s content.\n\nThis book starts by giving you a brief overview of how to hack manually, how to hack with extensions, and then a quick glance at what you will need to do to back up critical files so that you can practice safe hacking. \n\nThen it breaks down each of the individual components of Firefox from interface to rendering to privacy and walks you through hacking and modifying key files to apply tons of possible interface and functionality changes. It also includes a great list of proven extensions with which you can modify core features of Firefox, as well as the look and feel of the interface.\n\nIn addition, this book covers the grassroots efforts that Mozilla and Firefox have become known for among developersÃ¢â‚¬â€the ability to use the highly extendable Mozilla programming language and interface to modify any aspect of the browser by creating extensions, and also how you can change the appearance of the browser by creating themes.\n\nBook Details :\n\nTitle          : Hacking Firefox - More Than 150 Hacks, Mods, and Customizations\nPages          : 460\nSize           : 14.3 Mb\nFormat         : pdf\n\nfollow us on facebook \n\nhttp:// facebook .com /torrentsharing\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77c609a1fb2b4da51fc398c8ffc3d6533bc8c1d1","amp;dn":"Hacking+Firefox+-+More+Than+150+Hacks%2C+Mods%2C+and+Customizations+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77c609a1fb2b4da51fc398c8ffc3d6533bc8c1d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,198,9,161,251,43,77,165,31,195,152,200,255,195,214,83,59,200,193,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
