Griffith is Sam Whitehead, a tough, ex-Marine Korean War vet, who is also a new preacher. He is working in a brickyard, trying to support his young, expectant wife, (Merriwether) three children, a Mother-in-Law (Medford), and a lazy, boozing Brother-in-Law, who nearly steals the show, masterfully played by Jerry VanDyke in a rare, early movie appearance. Sam is given the task of re-building, and re-uniting a small town church. Both the church and the town is being torn apart by the two founding families. Laughs abound in this delightful film, and Griffith fans will see many familiar faces from Griffith&amp;#039;s long-running TV series. In fact this movie was made just after Griffith left the show. The quality is good and is in full-screen format.\n\nIf you liked this movie please leave a comment.
