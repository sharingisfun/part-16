Duke battles his way across towering skyscraper rooftops and through gritty subway stations, hunting for a power-hungry villain, Mech Morphix. Mutants of every kind are thrown at Duke as he chases down Morphix through eight huge environments and avoids the green slime called GLOPP which is causing all the chaos.\n\nBut radioactive slime isn't Duke's only problem - there are more than 25 uniquely dangerous mutated enemies hell-bent on making a meal of him. Whether it's Uzi-sporting alligators or ten-foot tall roach beasts - Duke's in town to blast the bad guys and save the chicks. Sure, pipe bombs, a machine gun, a rocket launcher and a pulse cannon are going to make a goo-filled mess in the Big Apple, but what's a hero to do?\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.\n\nWAITING ON THE REQUEST LIST TO BE UPLOADED:\n\nFAR CRY\nFAR CRY 2: FORTUNE'S EDITION\nMEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT WAR CHEST\t\nGOTHIC 1, 2, 3\nIN COLD BLOOD\nHEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC 5 BUNDLE\nINQUISITOR\n\n--------------\nREQUESTS THAT I CAN'T FULFILL AT THE MOMENT\n\nLeisure Suit Larry Language Pack\nDon't Starve\nKing of Dragon Pass\nGalactic Civilizations I Ultimate Edition\nThe Cat Lady\nJourneyman Project 3\nDYAD\nSword of the Stars: The Pit\nEtherlords 2\n\n--------------\n\nIF POSSIBLE, DON'T FORGET TO SUPPORT THE COMPANIES AND GOG.COM FOR THEIR GREAT SERVICE.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f1480a0d964492c6c99bbbb04db9c9d26eb2b61","amp;dn":"Duke+Nukem+-+Manhattan+Project+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f1480a0d964492c6c99bbbb04db9c9d26eb2b61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,20,128,160,217,100,73,44,108,153,187,187,4,219,156,157,38,235,43,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
