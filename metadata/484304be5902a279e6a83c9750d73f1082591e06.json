It features traditional recipes such as Miso-Seared Scallops, Pinched-Noodle Soup with Pork, Salmon-Stuffed Kelp Rolls, and basics like rice, stocks, and sauces, along with sake pairings and essays on Japan in recovery from journalists and food writers.\n\n Kibo was written by Japanese culinary authority Elizabeth Andoh, who was in her Tokyo kitchen when the Great Eastern-Japan Earthquake struck. Over the following months she witnessed the strength of the people of the Tohoku regionÃ¢â‚¬â€one of the largest miso- and sake-producing areas in JapanÃ¢â‚¬â€as they struggled with the effects of the resulting tsunami and nuclear accident. She was inspired to write Kibo (meaning Ã¢â‚¬Å“brimming with hopeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) to not only tell the story of the food of the Tohoku region but also to document the experiences of its people, both before and after the disaster. This lushly photographed original eBook will honor the region and its rich culture on the first anniversary of the earthquake, with a portion of the proceeds going to Japanese recovery efforts.\n\n2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:484304be5902a279e6a83c9750d73f1082591e06","amp;dn":"Kibo%3A+Recipes+and+Stories+from+Japan%27s+Tohoku+-epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"484304be5902a279e6a83c9750d73f1082591e06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,67,4,190,89,2,162,121,230,168,60,151,80,215,63,16,130,89,30,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
