(Flac)\n\nReview: - Bryan Buss, All Music Guide\n\nPer Gessle and Marie Fredriksson exploded onto the pop radar screen with Look Sharp!, which spawned four big hits: the bright, shiny &quot;The Look,&quot; the punchy, hopeful &quot;Dressed for Success,&quot; the A/C-leaning &quot;Dangerous,&quot; and the bland, \noverproduced &quot;Listen to Your Heart.&quot; \n\nThe cuts that weren't released as singles aren't necessarily filler, but they also \naren't as strong as many of the cuts that made up Roxette albums that followed, \nparticularly Joyride and Tourism (Songs From Studios, Stages, Hotelrooms &amp; \nOther Strange Places). \n\nThe non-releases are nothing memorable, and they don't age well, &quot;Paint&quot; and \n&quot;Dance Away&quot; in particular being pretty average in terms of production and melody. \nOnly &quot;Chances&quot; and &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; show glimmers of the skills the duo would soon flourish. \nGessle and Fredriksson became artists at crafting superb pop melodies and surrounding \nthem with amazing production, so think of this album as basic training. \n \t\n\nLinage: CD &gt; EAC &gt; flac\n\nIncluded: NFO, PLS, M3U, LOG, CUE\nCovers: Front \nTags: VorbisComment\n\n\nSong list\n\n01.
