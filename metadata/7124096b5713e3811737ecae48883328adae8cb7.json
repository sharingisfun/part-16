Fry continues the Eclipse Comics Upload Project!\n\nWiki, him say:\n\nThe Liberty Project is an American comic book series created by writer Kurt Busiek, creator of Astro City and Thunderbolts, and artist James W. Fry. The Liberty Project was published by Eclipse Comics in 1987 and ran for eight issues until 1988 before its cancellation.\n\nThe series told the story of a team of four (later five) former criminals, all of whom incidentally had super powers. After the U.S. government quickly learns that the cost of locking up super-powered criminals is prohibitive, the original four team members--Cimarron, Crackshot, Slick, and Burnout--are offered an early parole in exchange for protecting their country against other super-powered criminals.\n\nThis torrent contains all eight issues. Thank you creative teams! Thank you scanners!
