This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nCheryl Ladd, one of television's &quot;Charlie's Angels&quot; debuts at number 37.  Casey claims her song, &quot;Think It Over&quot; is the first top 40 hit ever by any performer whose first big success in show business was acting (not singing) in TV commercials.\n\nA listener asks, &quot;Which is the most successful comedy album in chart history?&quot; Casey says this album by the man who currently plays television's favorite shrink spent 108 weeks on the LP chart with 14 weeks in the number one spot. \n\nIn a future AT40 broadcast (November 17th, 1979), Casey will detail how sweet little Anne Murray used to be a big fat pain in the neck, and in this broadcast we can begin to understand why. He describes how she only took up singing to help pay bills after college. When school started, she quit singing and taught for the next year. The producer who desperately wanted her to come back and sing must have thought she was playing &quot;hard to get&quot; (maybe she was thinking of him when she recorded her song, &quot;You Needed Me&quot; which is at number 28).\n\nCasey gives a Special Report concerning which branch of entertainment is pulling in the biggest amount of 1978 dollars. His conclusion is the public spends way more on music than movies. Then, a little later, he says this countdown has more movie songs (nine) than any have ever before. Why can't we just have both?\n\nA listener asks this question: &quot;In the rock era, has there ever been a recording act that released two different songs with the same title, and hit the chart with both of them?&quot; The only thing nuttier than that question is the answer. Casey says it DID happen. The title of these songs from the mid 60's was &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; (but Casey can fill in the details because I don't want everybody to know). \n\nAccording to Casey, Donna Summer (at number 10 with her hit, &quot;Last Dance&quot;), is the only person to hit #1 on disco chart more than once in its 2 year existence. That's all I got.\n\nUntil this week in 1978, the Category of &quot;Most Number One Songs by the Same Composer in a Calendar Year&quot; was held by Lennon/McCartney (they had six). This week's new number one makes it seven for the composer who now leads everybody else in the history of the chart (including Cole Porter, Goffin &amp; King, or Holland-Dozier-Holland).\n \n40: Shadow Dancin' - The Bee Gees\n39: The Love Theme From &quot;The Eyes Of Laura Mars&quot; - Barbra Streisand\n38: Right Down The Line - Gerry Rafferty\n37: Think It Over - Cheryl Ladd\n36: Don't Look Back - Boston\n35: Get Off - Foxy\n34: Rock And Roll Fantasy - The Kinks\n33: Oh Darlin' - Robin Gibb\n32: Just What I Needed - The Cars\n31: Whenever I Call You Friend - Kenny Loggins with Stevie Nicks\n30: Rivers Of Babylon - Boney M\n29: Close The Door - Teddy Pendergrass\n28: You Needed Me - Anne Murray\n27: Hollywood Nights - Bob Seger &amp; The Silver Bullet Band\n26: Macho Man - Village People\n25: You - Rita Coolidge\n24: Two Tickets To Paradise - Eddie Money\n23: Reminiscing - The Little River Band\n22: Stuff Like That - Quincy Jones\n21: Summer Nights - John Travolta &amp; Olivia Newton John\n20: You And I - Rick James\n19: Love Is In The Air - John Paul Young\n18: Life's Been Good - Joe Walsh\n17: My Angel Baby - Toby Beaux Group\n16: Hot Child In The City - Nick Guilder\n15: Fool If You Think It's Over - Chris Rea\n14: Copacabana - Barry Manilow\n13: Got To Get You Into My Life - Earth, Wind &amp; Fire\n12: Shame - Evelyn &quot;Champagne&quot; King\n11: Kiss You All Over - Exile\n10: Last Dance - Donna Summer\n9: Everlasting Love - Andy Gibb\n8: Magnet And Steel - Walter Egan\n7: Hopelessly Devoted To You - Olivia Newton-John\n6: Love Will Find A Way - Pablo Cruise\nLDD: Desiree - Neil Diamond\n5: Hot-Blooded - Foreigner\n4: Boogie Oogie Oogie - A Taste Of Honey\n3: Miss You - The Rolling Stones\n2: Three Times A Lady - The Commodores\n1: Grease - Frankie Valli","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4269554ef71788a52f27f099eed71b5da2bff563","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1978_August_26th_First_Long_Distance_Dedication","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4269554ef71788a52f27f099eed71b5da2bff563","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,105,85,78,247,23,136,165,47,39,240,153,238,215,27,93,162,191,245,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
