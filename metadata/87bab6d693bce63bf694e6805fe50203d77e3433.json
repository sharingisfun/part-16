And there is one way, one woman, who can help him break that cycle.\n\nStill shadowed by a trauma she cannot forget, Emma Watson is damaged in ways she will never reveal, not to anyoneÃ¢â‚¬Â¦except the dangerous, intense man who has haunted her dreams for the last two years, a man she has barely spoken to, a man who has come back into her life for forty-eight hours.\n\nA full moon. A dark sky. A whispered confession. A secret pact between two almost strangers who will part ways in the morning, never to speak again. But when these two combustuous, passionate souls finally come togetherÃ¢â‚¬Â¦nothing will ever be the same again. Is there any way to recover from what they have done, or are they doomed to the very fate they were trying so desperately to escape? \nGenre: Fiction, Romance\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87bab6d693bce63bf694e6805fe50203d77e3433","amp;dn":"Prince+Charming+Can+Wait+%28Ever+After%29+-+Rowe%2C+Stephanie.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87bab6d693bce63bf694e6805fe50203d77e3433","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,186,182,214,147,188,230,59,246,148,230,128,95,229,2,3,215,126,52,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
