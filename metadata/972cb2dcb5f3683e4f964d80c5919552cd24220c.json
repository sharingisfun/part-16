Similarly to other PC tuneup software solutions on the market, AVG PC Tuneup will scan your computer for problems and repair them as fast as possible. But the application has many more goodies under its hood. The computer scanning process takes less than a minute, while fixing them might exceed 10 minutes, depending on the number of problems and their nature.\n\nRestores your PC to top speed\nRemember how fast your PC used to run when you got it? Not only can we help get it back there, but you can also enjoy Turbo Mode to release that extra bit of power when you need it for browsing, gaming and videos.\n\nA Smoother running PC\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a bit like having a doctor and cleaner permanently on hand.

Half the time we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what it is, if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s important and or how to delete it. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll analyze your PC for all that junk and show you how to get rid of it in a few simple clicks. Result? One faster PC and more space for you.\n\nKeeps your PC at peak performance\nGetting fast is all well and good, but not if it only does it once. We continually work in the background, and constantly update the way we tune, to help your PC always run at top speed.\n\nLeaves no trace of your most important files\nHitting the delete button doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always give you that complete peace of mind. Hitting the Shredder button will.\n\nGives you complete performance Ã¢â‚¬â€œ automatically\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always good when thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one thing less to remember. We continually monitor your PC and let you know the status. And we even run routine maintenance when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re away from your PC so it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get in the way.
