No idea who this was scanned by, so if you know please contact me. A great trio of Green Lantern stories by arguably one of the best comics writers ever, the esteemed Alan Moore. Of note in particularly, &quot;Tygers&quot; was illustrated by Kevin O'Neill, whom he would collaborate with later on &quot;The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;, and &quot;Mogo Doesn't Socialize&quot; was illustrated by Dave Gibbons.\n\nSynthesist noted this earlier- this was packaged on a Mac. For Windows readers, rename the end from a .cbr to a .zip, unzip, and then delete the _MACOSX file. Then repackage. This will allow you to read on a windows computer. Easy process!\n\nEnjoy the comics,\n\n-Ajsztehlo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e07ad18ce53c05385d91677c24c16cd96c93d4a","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Green+Lantern+%7BBy+Alan+Moore+And+Others%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e07ad18ce53c05385d91677c24c16cd96c93d4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,7,173,24,206,83,192,83,133,217,22,119,194,76,22,205,150,201,61,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
