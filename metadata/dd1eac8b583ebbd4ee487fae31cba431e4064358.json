Baba Booey! It was a slip of the tongueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that unfortunately was heard by a few million listenersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but in that split second a nickname, a persona, a rallying cry, and a phenomenon was born. Some would say it was the moment Gary DellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Abate, the long-suffering heroic producer of The Howard Stern Show, for better or worse, finally came into his own. In They Call Me Baba Booey, DellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Abate explains how his early life was the perfect training ground for the day-to-day chaos that comes with producing the most popular radio show on earth. \n\nGrowing up on Long Island in the 1970s, the youngest of three boys born to a clinically depressed mother, Gary learned how to fend for himself when under attack.  Obsessed with music, he listened with religious intensity to Casey Kasem's Top 40 every Sunday morning, compulsively bought 45s of his favorite songs, and nerdily copied the lyrics into a notebook. Music became an ordering principle to his life, even as the chaos at home got out of hand. DellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢AbateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s memoir sketches the trajectory from the obsessive pop-music trivia buff to the man in the beekeeperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mask who handily defeats his opponents playing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStump the Booey.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ We learn about the memorable moments in his life that taught him to endure epic bouts of humiliation and get his unique perspective on some of his favorite Stern show episodesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½such as the day he nearly killed the Mets mascot while throwing out the first pitch, or the time his mother called HowardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mother and demanded an apology. \n\nHilarious, painful, and eye-opening, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Gary as youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve never seen him before, telling a story that even Stern show insiders canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t begin to imagine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd1eac8b583ebbd4ee487fae31cba431e4064358","amp;dn":"Audiobook+-+They+Call+Me++Baba+Booey+-+Gary+Dell%5C%27Abate","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd1eac8b583ebbd4ee487fae31cba431e4064358","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,30,172,139,88,62,187,212,238,72,127,174,49,203,164,49,228,6,67,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
