They are credited with creating atmospheric and delicate, yet viscerally urgent, music which flew under the radar of popular culture.[citation needed] Their oeuvre is generally cited alongside those of Joy Division, The Chameleons, The Cure, The Sound, and Echo &amp; the Bunnymen. They toured heavily in their native UK and in Western Europe, but rarely in the United States. Their influence can be discerned in acts such as Catherine Wheel and Kitchens of Distinction, and 2000s Post-punk revival bands such as Interpol, Engineers and The Editors. \n\n?\tWaiting for a Miracle (1980)  \n?\tSleep No More (1981) \n?\tFiction (1982)   \n?\tLand (1983) \n?\t7 Day Weekend (1985) \n?\tChasing Shadows (1986) \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fa62e32b0e950bb2633601dcba0754168a92300","amp;dn":"The+Comsat+Angels+%5B6+Albums+1980-1986%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fa62e32b0e950bb2633601dcba0754168a92300","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,166,46,50,176,233,80,187,38,51,96,29,203,160,117,65,104,169,35,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
