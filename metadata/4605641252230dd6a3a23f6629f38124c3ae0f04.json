It has snow and ice all year round, a very raresight in Africa. Mount Kilimanjaro stands alone, it is not part of a mountain chain and is not connected to any other mountain. It is the tallest free-standing mountain in the world.\n\nMount Kilimanjaro ranks as one of the biggest volcanoes on Earth, although it is actually made up of three volcanoes. The tallest is a cone-shaped volcano named Kibo. It highest peak rises 19,341 feet (5,895 meters) above sea level.\nThe second one is Mawenzi, which is shorter and has a jagged peak. The third one - Shira - collapsed long time ago and has eroded and worn away so much that its - once - jagged peak has become a flat plateau.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4605641252230dd6a3a23f6629f38124c3ae0f04","amp;dn":"Natural+Wonders+-+Mount+Kilimanjaro+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4605641252230dd6a3a23f6629f38124c3ae0f04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,5,100,18,82,35,13,214,163,162,63,102,41,243,129,36,195,174,15,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
