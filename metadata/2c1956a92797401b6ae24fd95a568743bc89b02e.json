Of course, the success of Brothers in Arms was helped considerably by the clever computer-animated video for &quot;Money for Nothing,&quot; a sardonic attack on MTV. But what kept the record selling was Mark Knopfler's increased sense of pop songcraft - &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; had an indelible guitar riff, &quot;Walk of Life&quot; is a catchy up-tempo boogie variation on &quot;Sultans of Swing,&quot; and the melodies of the bluesy &quot;So Far Away&quot; and the down-tempo, Everly Brothers-style &quot;Why Worry&quot; were wistful and lovely. Dire Straits had never been so concise or pop-oriented, and it wore well on them. Though they couldn't maintain that consistency through the rest of the album - only the jazzy &quot;Your Latest Trick&quot; and the flinty &quot;Ride Across the River&quot; make an impact - Brothers in Arms remains one of their most focused and accomplished albums, and in its succinct pop sense, it's distinctive within their catalog.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c1956a92797401b6ae24fd95a568743bc89b02e","amp;dn":"Dire+Straits+-+Brothers+in+Arms+%282013%29+MFSL+FLAC+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c1956a92797401b6ae24fd95a568743bc89b02e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,25,86,169,39,151,64,27,106,226,79,217,90,86,135,67,188,137,176,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
