Haanel was a successful business man who discovered that spiritual life is a key to success in everything you do. He proved that what is happening outside is in a direct relation to what is taking place in your consciousness.\n\nWhen the Master Key was published, it was one of those books that successful business men wanted out of the market. They didn&amp;#039;t want people to read this book as its truths would help anyone to overcome limitations.\n\nThe rumor is that when Bill Gates was just a student, he read this book and utilized its truths. Rest is history.\n\nI have read this book - it is divided in chapters that have introductions and numbered paragraphs to study. It starts from understanding the principles of your conscious mind and its power and advances to utilizing these principles.\n\nAs you put in use what the author explains in this volume, you will start seeing substantial changes in your reality. In many ways, Charles was so much ahead of his time. Even today most profilic business coaches such as Antohony Robbins etc. do not admit the fact that your life is in your control 100%. We are taught that we are at the mercy of externals, but it ain&amp;#039;t so.\n\nIn many ways, Charles F. Haanel is the most outstanding business coach there has ever been. Way before current business coaches who incorporate spiritual life and business, he did it. If you are an owner of major company -- have every employee of your company to read this book and utilize it in their daily routines. Your company will become the new success story. That is for sure.\n\nWhy am I giving just 4 stars for such an outstanding book? Well that is because the volume is rather long. I think the central message of this book could have been condensed into 60 pages -- but instead the author goes on and on for several hundred pages. On the other hand -- this does ensure that everyone grasps the principles involved in creating success.\n\nDoes it work? Yes it does. Why do some people fail? Well, they just read this book but don&amp;#039;t put in use its truths. For some it is difficult to understand or believe that your life is just a mirror that is telling you what you are in your consciousness. Think you have a problem, and one will surface. Think you have a solution and it is as well yours. Fair game.
