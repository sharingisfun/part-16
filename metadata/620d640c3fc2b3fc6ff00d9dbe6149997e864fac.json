This one's got lost of garage-y, wobbly baseline goodness, but the 4x4 backbeat remains :)\n\nAll files are 320kbps, 44.1 sample rate, joint stereo mp3's\n\nFrom FM:\n&quot;All my music is available here for free, but if you'd also like to support me (i.e. help me pay for rent, groceries, gas, etc), please visit my website and buy a track or two! I have no record label, no marketing machine (other than me), no gimmicks, just me and my choons! ...peace and beats :) -FM&quot;\n\n \n\n\nFM and Roy thank you :)     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JambOAAdc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JambOAAdc&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:620d640c3fc2b3fc6ff00d9dbe6149997e864fac","amp;dn":"DJ+FM+-+www-djfm-com+-+Thirty-Five+Mix+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"620d640c3fc2b3fc6ff00d9dbe6149997e864fac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,13,100,12,63,194,179,252,111,240,13,157,190,97,73,153,126,134,79,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
