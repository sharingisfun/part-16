While traveling they are free to act single, adopting the mantra &quot;what happens in Europe, stays in Europe.&quot; But hours into Ryan's adventure with his party animal and womanizing best friend Brandon (Dillon Casey, Nikita), he realizes he's made a huge mistake and sets off in search of her. The only problem is he has no idea where she could be - they never exchanged itineraries. This marks the start of a wild adventure that takes the duo to the Amalfi coast, Rome, Berlin, Prague and Paris as they search for Beth, try to avoid an annoying Aussie, dodge a homicidal maniac and fit in a little action on the way.\n[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c31656ee9ba8e46355c7f7921c5b0d89194b4951","amp;dn":"Backpackers.S01E01.720p.HDTV.x264-IMMERSE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c31656ee9ba8e46355c7f7921c5b0d89194b4951","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,22,86,238,155,168,228,99,85,199,247,146,28,91,13,137,25,75,73,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
