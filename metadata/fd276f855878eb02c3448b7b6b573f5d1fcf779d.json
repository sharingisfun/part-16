The unprecedented live concert event Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which was released on four DVDs (or Blu-rays) last fall with all four debuting in the Top 10 on Billboard's Music DVD Chart Ã¢â‚¬â€œ was captured last year when Bonamassa performed a quartet of shows at the iconic London venues heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s played throughout his career Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Royal Albert Hall, Hammersmith Apollo, ShepherdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bush Empire, and The Borderline. The venues provide the backdrop for a ferocious four-night event, each evening marked by a unique theme featuring Bonamassa with different bands, different set lists, and different arrangements and ensembles performing over 60 songs in total Ã¢â‚¬â€œ some never performed live before Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from BonamassaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extensive career.\n\nThe following evening at ShepherdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bush Empire is a blues-themed night featuring a horns section with a soulful, big-blues-band feel.\n\nThen on to the Hammersmith Apollo which opens with a short acoustic set before moving into a rock-inspired evening.\n\nFinally, on the fourth and final night at the Royal Albert Hall, Bonamassa treats the crowd to a half acoustic/half electric show of his most popular and well-known songs featuring the acoustic band from his #1 Billboard acoustic CD/DVD An Acoustic Evening at the Vienna Opera House.\n\nThe end result Ã¢â‚¬â€œ over 9 hours of concert footage Ã¢â‚¬â€œ more than lives up to its billing as Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Guitar Event of The YearÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and sees Bonamassa reliving, revisiting, and redefining the many phases and pivotal moments throughout his career and delivering a once-in-a-lifetime performance that more than serves as an appropriate retrospective for an artist who has already achieved so much.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCD1:\n01.
