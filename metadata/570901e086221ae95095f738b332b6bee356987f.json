The format is just Hooker and his guitar, and in this intimate setting, the blues veteran has plenty of room to stretch out, improvise and say what needs to be said. Not just the boogie, but some serious blues too. This recording caught Hooker up close, giving both voice and guitar a lot of force.\nA candidate for best John Lee Hooker live album.\n\n\n\nDisc 1 :The First Show\n01. I Miss You So 2:38\n02.
