When the command is forced to run, Wyatt and Seminole Chief Oscala square off in an exciting climax. \n\nUser Review\n\nSee it - They don't make 'em like they used to. Gary Cooper brings us another great action classic. It's the story of American soldiers who attack a fort in the everglades during the Seminole Wars in the 1800's. They are then chased by Indians through swamps for the rest of the movie. The movie delivers every possible action scenario that you could imagine in a setting like that. It's very similar to the first half of the classic film &quot;Davy Crockett.&quot; Remember when Davy Crockett fights the Indians in the swamp? Well that's what goes down this entire movie. You don't watch a movie like this for its plot. Yes, it's old. But it's Gary Cooper at his best. There is plenty of battles, including a cool underwater fight scene at the end. What do I mean by that? Well you'll have to watch it and find out. 4 out of 5 action rating","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a2b51960568a729593f37081f612c2645cb9eba","amp;dn":"Distant+Drums+%28Action%2C+Western%29+%7BG%2C+Cooper%2C+Mari+Aldon%7D+%5B1951%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a2b51960568a729593f37081f612c2645cb9eba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,43,81,150,5,104,167,41,89,63,55,8,31,97,44,38,69,203,158,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
