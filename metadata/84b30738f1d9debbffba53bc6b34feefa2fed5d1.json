Rosenberg  - Retail (epub)\n\n\nA terrible darkness has fallen upon Jacob WeiszÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beloved Germany. The Nazi regime, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler, has surged to power and now hold Germany by the throat. All non-AryansÃ¢â‚¬â€especially Jews like Jacob and his familyÃ¢â‚¬â€are treated like dogs.\n\nWhen tragedy strikes during one terrible night of violence, Jacob flees and joins rebel forces working to undermine the regime. But after a raid goes horribly wrong, Jacob finds himself in a living nightmareÃ¢â‚¬â€trapped in a crowded, stinking car on the train to the Auschwitz death camp.\n\nAs World War II rages and Hitler begins implementing his Ã¢â‚¬Å“final solutionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to systematically and ruthlessly exterminate the Jewish people, Jacob must rely on his wits and a God heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not sure he believes in to somehow escape from Auschwitz and alert the world to the NaziÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s atrocities before Fascism overtakes all of Europe. The fate of millions hangs in the balance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84b30738f1d9debbffba53bc6b34feefa2fed5d1","amp;dn":"The+Auschwitz+Escape+-+Joel+C.+Rosenberg+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84b30738f1d9debbffba53bc6b34feefa2fed5d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,179,7,56,241,217,222,187,255,186,83,188,107,52,254,239,162,254,213,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
