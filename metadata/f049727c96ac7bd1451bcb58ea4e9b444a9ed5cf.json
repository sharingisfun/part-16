Proficient at its instruments, its membership keens toward a unified front, this self-aware everyman presence that eschews virtuosity in favor of togetherness, as these four men squeeze their way through a swamp-assed tromp in the wilds of nasty blues and Southern rock. Most of their songs hover past the 8-minute mark, so that anyone just walking into the bar theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re playing gets more of a chance to grab a lick. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incredible background music, and when/where/why you decide to pay attention depends solely on you. And when you do, GREAT! Dip in your friendly conversation with Boz Scaggs? Zen moment in the mensÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ room, honkinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ on bobo? TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re your boys.\n\nEndless Boogie is not high-concept, and as such, their music is easily deconstructed. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pop songwriting Ã¢â‚¬â€ then thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s these guys. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very little build-up to get to their songs. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re there. But wait! Time travel is for suckers. You want to extend your time on Earth because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all you got. The triple-length jams that roll out of this forge give the illusion that everythingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the same, while robbing you of your time. Robbie Robertson wrote Ã¢â‚¬Å“you put the load right on me.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hard rock, blues rock, psych rock Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ these are obsessions, the weight of the obsessed. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m one of them. You might be, too. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m aware that huge chunks of the world slip right past my view, choosing instead to go deaf in search of the righteous vibe. Its poison is the allure. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not for everyone, but it is for some. People with lots to do wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t dig this too much.\n\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no Krautrock in their approach, no attempts at minimalism or pop jockinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or rebranding of the form. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing more than riffinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and blue-collar soloinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. And you better love those riffs, because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gonna take Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem a while to resolve. Their music comes from confinement, in the garage, revvinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in neutral, trying to get a base high. Class and personality is not on display. The public-facing organ of Endless Boogie, Paul Major, croaks like Fred Cole doing Chris Griffin from Family Guy. He barks about grabbinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ some Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mighty Fine PieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the sensible throngs drift off, as a pack of wolves up front leer like escaped cons from the foot of the stage. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dirty.\n\nThis is a band that has four full-length albums to its credit. Never has it bent or changed. Humans take a break from everyday life to do something they love, and in the case of these gents, they attempt to give back. We made ourselves this way. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m far from a generation that told me it was a good idea to listen to Free. I had to travel backward to get there. It took a long time. That search, that struggle is represented in the 9-minute asphalt melters and the fumes they generate. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re either impressed with their single-mindedness, or youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve stopped reading this review.\n\nEndless Boogie uses the infinity symbol as its logo. The problem with Endless Boogie is its solution.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f049727c96ac7bd1451bcb58ea4e9b444a9ed5cf","amp;dn":"Endless+Boogie+-+Full+House+Head+%5B2010%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f049727c96ac7bd1451bcb58ea4e9b444a9ed5cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,73,114,124,150,172,123,209,69,27,203,88,234,78,155,68,74,158,213,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
