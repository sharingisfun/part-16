Emeli Gouraguine (nÃƒÂ©e SandÃƒÂ©), born 10 March 1987, better known as Emeli SandÃƒÂ©, is an British recording artist and songwriter. \nShe first became prominent after she featured on the track &quot;Diamond Rings&quot; by the rapper Chipmunk (2009). \nIt was their first top 10 single on the UK Singles Chart. \nIn 2010, she featured on &quot;Never Be Your Woman&quot; by the rapper Wiley, which became another top ten hit. \nSimon Cowell called SandÃƒÂ© &quot;his favourite songwriter at the minute&quot;. \nIn 2012 she received the Brit Awards Critics' Choice Award. \nShe has written for a number of artists, including Alicia Keys, Cher Lloyd, Parade, Susan Boyle, Gabrielle, Preeya Kalidas, Rihanna, Leona Lewis, Alesha Dixon, Cheryl Cole, Tinie Tempah, Ella Henderson, Mutya Keisha Siobhan, and Fantasia Barrino.\nIn 2010, she signed a publishing deal with EMI Music Publishing. \nShe later announced that Virgin Records had given her a record deal. \nSandÃƒÂ© released her first solo single &quot;Heaven&quot; in August 2011. \nSandÃƒÂ© has three number-one singles across the United Kingdom and Ireland with &quot;Read All About It&quot; with Professor Green, &quot;Next to Me&quot; and &quot;Beneath Your Beautiful&quot; a collaboration with Labrinth. \nHer album Our Version of Events spent 7 non-consecutive weeks at number 1 and became the best-selling album of 2012 in the UK, with over 1 million sales.\nIn 2012 she performed in both the Opening and Closing ceremonies of the London Olympics.\n\nEarly life\n\nEmeli SandÃƒÂ© was born Adele Emeli SandÃƒÂ© in Sunderland,to a Zambian father, Joel SandÃƒÂ©, and English mother, Diane SandÃƒÂ©-Wood, on 10 March 1987. \nHer father moved from Zambia and met her mother while they were both at university in Sunderland.\nSandÃƒÂ© read medicine, in the five-year MBChB course, at the University of Glasgow, but she stopped in her fourth year. \nShe has stated that education was one of the most important things to her, because, if her music career failed, she would have something to fall back on. \nFurther, SandÃƒÂ© said that her manager, Adrian Sykes, waited patiently from when she was 16; &quot;Adrian really respects that I want to get an education behind me. \nHe also knows my parents are keen that I finish university&quot;. \nSandÃƒÂ© has a tattoo of artist Frida Kahlo.\nSandÃƒÂ© wrote her first song at age 11, for her primary school talent show. \nShe remembers &quot;That was the first time I thought I might be a songwriter. \nI always knew I wanted to be a musician and I knew I wanted to write because the people I was listening to all wrote. \nI never thought it was an option to sing anyone else's songs. \nThe first song she wrote was called &quot;Tomorrow Starts Again&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the song had proper structure and even a middle eight.\nChoice FM invited the 15-year-old SandÃƒÂ© to London to take part in their &quot;Rapology&quot; competition. \nRichard Blackwood also had her down to MTV's Camden studios to sing gospel. \nSandÃƒÂ© attended Alford Academy, at which her father was a teacher. \nShe said &quot;I hated to be ill and to miss a day because I was so hungry to learn. \nI was very shy, nerdy and extremely well-behaved. \nInevitably, throughout secondary school, it was part and parcel of my identity that I was Mr. SandÃƒÂ©'s daughter. \nNo way could I muck about or get into trouble, because it would've got back to him within minutes. \nAnd Dad was strict, let me tell you&quot;.\n\nFor more info please check out this Link :
