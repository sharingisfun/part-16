In 1987 Weiland         |\n|  founded the band Mighty Joe Young with guitarist Robert DeLeo; later      |\n|  rechristened Stone Temple Pilots, the group became one of the biggest     |\n|  acts of the mid-&amp;#039;90s, following the lead of artists like Nirvana and      |\n|  Pearl Jam to top the charts with their angst-ridden hard rock sound.      |\n|  However, their success did not come without a price, and following the    |\n|  group&amp;#039;s second LP, 1994&amp;#039;s Purple, it was revealed that Weiland had        |\n|  become a heroin addict. After a stay in rehab, he returned to Stone       |\n|  Temple Pilots to record their third record, 1996&amp;#039;s Tiny Music...Songs     |\n|  from the Vatican Giftshop. However, after Weiland suffered a relapse in   |\n|  his ongoing battle with drugs, the group was forced to cancel their       |\n|  upcoming tour; when the other three members subsequently recorded an      |\n|  album with a different singer under the name Talk Show, STP&amp;#039;s continued   |\n|  existence appeared shaky at best, and Weiland went solo to record 1998&amp;#039;s  |\n|  12 Bar Blues.                                                             |\n|                                                                            |\n|  Problems stemming from drug abuse continued to dog Weiland during the     |\n|  late &amp;#039;90s as his album faltered commercially and a subsequent arrest for  |\n|  buying heroin ultimately landed the troubled singer in jail.              |\n|  Nonetheless, STP reconvened for the 1999 album No. 4 featuring the hit    |\n|  single &quot;Sour Girl&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹ purportedly inspired by the breakup of Weiland&amp;#039;s     |\n|  marriage. Despite the success of the album, STP officially parted ways    |\n|  around 2001 surrounding speculation that a fight between Weiland and      |\n|  DeLeo was to blame. Post his time with STP, Weiland still seemed unable   |\n|  to avoid controversy as a car crash on his birthday in 2003 landed him    |\n|  in rehab. Around this time, former Guns N&amp;#039; Roses members guitarist        |\n|  Slash, bassist Duff McKagan, and drummer Matt Sorum auditioned Weiland    |\n|  for their new band. The trio took to Weiland immediately, and the newly   |\n|  christened hard rock ensemble Velvet Revolver released their debut        |\n|  album, Contraband, in 2004. The album sold well and the band even picked  |\n|  up a Grammy for Best Rock Song for the single &quot;Slither&quot; in 2005. Weiland  |\n|  was also onboard for Velvet Revolver&amp;#039;s 2007 sophomore effort, Libertad.   |\n|                                                                            |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e842601d8c1db5fea6334277e445cda6d100b99f","amp;dn":"Scott_Weiland-Happy_In_Galoshes-%28Advance%29-2008-RVP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e842601d8c1db5fea6334277e445cda6d100b99f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,66,96,29,140,29,181,254,166,51,66,119,228,69,205,166,209,0,185,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
