ExxonMobilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s annual revenues are larger than the economic activity in the great majority of countries. \n\nIn many of the countries where it conducts business, ExxonMobilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sway over politics and security is greater than that of the United States embassy. In Washington, ExxonMobil spends more money lobbying Congress and the White House than almost any other corporation. Yet despite its outsized influence, it is a black box.\n\nSteve Coll, president of the New America Foundation and a staff writer at The New Yorker. His most recent book is called Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power. Previously, he was managing editor of the Washington Post and has also been a reporter, foreign correspondent and editor at the paper. He was awarded his second Pulitzer Prize for the book Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the C.I.A., Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001. He is also author of The Bin Ladens: An Arabian Family in the American Century.\n\nVideo: http://www.democracynow.org/2012/5/4/private_empire_author_steve_coll_on\n\n\nREAD THE E-BOOK ! \nAvailable at : https://onebigtorrent.org/torrents/13295/Private-Empire-ExxonMobil-and-American-Power--Steve-Coll\n\n\nshunster","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06482755c906fa6fcabdd9896eae1ed25fbb5b12","amp;dn":"%26ldquo%3BPrivate+Empire%3AExxonMobil+and+American+Power%26rdquo%3B+2012+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06482755c906fa6fcabdd9896eae1ed25fbb5b12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,72,39,85,201,6,250,111,202,189,217,137,110,174,30,210,95,187,91,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
