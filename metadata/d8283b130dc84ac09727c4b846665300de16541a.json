The change is both dynamic and reversible. Dynamic because no external processing is required for the index modulation to be revealed, and reversible because the index change can be modified or suppressed by altering the illumination pattern. These properties make photorefractive materials very attractive candidates for many applications such as image restoration, correlation, beam conjugation, non-destructive testing, data storage, imaging through scattering media, holographic imaging and display. The field of photorefractive organic material is also closely related to organic photovoltaic and light emitting diode (OLED), which makes new discoveries in one field applicable to others","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8283b130dc84ac09727c4b846665300de16541a","amp;dn":"Photorefractive+Organic+Materials+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8283b130dc84ac09727c4b846665300de16541a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,40,59,19,13,200,74,192,151,39,196,184,70,102,83,0,222,22,84,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
