It was eventually released in 70 countries. \nIt was directed by Carlos Saldanha, co-director of the original Ice Age, \nand the music is done by Robots composer, John Powell.\n\nIn the opening scene, Scrat, the saber-toothed squirrel climbs a glacier \nbut accidentally opens a hole in it. The world of ice is slowly melting.\n\nThe creatures of the Ice Age are all shown enjoying themselves on slides and pools \nmade by the melting ice; among them the three protagonists of the first film: Manfred, \nSid, and Diego. Sid opens a day camp, where none of the younger creatures take him \nseriously, nor do Manfred and Diego, which leaves Sid seeking a daring deed. \nFast Tony , a local con artist is claiming that the earth will flood and that the \nbark and reeds which he sells are needed to stay alive. Manfred dismisses the idea, \nbut is distracted when he sees that Sid will try to high dive from a giant waterfall; \nas Manfred goes with Diego to the top of the waterfall to save Sid from his act of daredevilry, \nthey see that the pleasant weather caused the ice of the valley to melt, \nand it is kept from destroying the valley only by the glaciers, which have formed a dam. \nAs the animals begin their journey, Sid sings three songs to tease Manny about Mammoths being 'extinct.'\n\n\n\n\nFormat                           : MPEG-4\nCodec ID                         : mp42\nFile size                        : 700 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 20mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1222 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nCodec ID                         : avc1\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 1059 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 560 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16/9\nFrame rate mode                  : Variable\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nMinimum frame rate               : 24.987 fps\nMaximum frame rate               : 45.802 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.105\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 160 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 230 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nLanguage                         : English\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayback Problems?  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.videolan.org/vlc/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.videolan.org/vlc/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nJacket &amp; DVD @600dpi\n\n\nand you're welcome..;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1da3f9640d0518c9d1a0bf91cab310eaa9264a85","amp;dn":"Ice+Age+2+-The+Meltdown+2006+%5BH.264-MP4%5D+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1da3f9640d0518c9d1a0bf91cab310eaa9264a85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,163,249,100,13,5,24,201,209,160,191,145,202,179,16,234,169,38,74,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
