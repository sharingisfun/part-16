This book deals diversely with the issues of art, origins, and otherness, both in themselves and in philosophical engagements with the works of Plato, Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and Heidegger. Addressing themes such as eros and mania, genius and the sublime, transcendence and the saving power of art, William Desmond tries to make sense of the paradox that too much has been asked of art that now almost nothing is asked of it. He argues that there is more to be said philosophically of art, and claims that art has the power to open up mindfulness beyond objectifying knowledge, as well as beyond thinking that claims to be entirely self-determining.\n\n&quot;This book is a passionate questioning of the place of art in relation to 'transcendence,' and specifically to religion and philosophy (especially metaphysics).&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ VÃƒÂ©ronique M. FÃƒÂ³ti, author of Vision's Invisibles: Philosophical Explorations\n\n&quot;The pleasure in reading Desmond has as much to do with the rigor of his thought as it does with the felicitous and creative ways in which he expresses his insights. The turns of phrase he employs and the concrete examples which he so often introduces not only make his 'abstract' thought more vivid and compelling but also add to the pleasures of reading his texts.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ Jere Paul O'Neill Surber, University of Denver\n\n&quot;This is the work of a mature philosopher who takes the great textual tradition very seriously.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ Robert E. Wood, author of Placing Aesthetics: Reflections on the Philosophic Tradition\n\nWilliam Desmond is Professor of Philosophy and Director of the International Program in Philosophy, Institute of Philosophy, at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium. He is the author of many books, including the award-winning Being and the Between; Ethics and the Between; and coeditor (with Joseph Grange) of Being and Dialectic: Metaphysics as a Cultural Presence; all published by SUNY Press.\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPreface\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.
