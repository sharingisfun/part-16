Jerome of a boating holiday on the Thames between Kingston and Oxford.\n\nThe book was initially intended to be a serious travel guide, with accounts of local history along the route, but the humorous elements took over to the point where the serious and somewhat sentimental passages seem a distraction to the comic novel. \n\nOne of the most praised things about Three Men in a Boat is how undated it appears to modern readers. The jokes seem fresh and witty even today.\n\n\nThe three men are based on Jerome himself (the narrator J.) and two real-life friends, George Wingrave (who went on to become a senior manager in Barclays Bank) and Carl Hentschel (the founder of a London printing business, called Harris in the book), with whom he often took boating trips. The dog, Montmorency, is entirely fictional, but as Jerome remarked, &quot;had much of me in it.&quot; \n\nThe trip is a typical boating holiday of the time in a Thames camping skiff. This is just after commercial boat traffic on the Upper Thames had died out, replaced by the 1880s craze for boating as a leisure activity.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a57d00065fda65ee9363796af48817ec9a44647d","amp;dn":"Jerome+K.+Jerome+-+Three+Men+in+a+Boat++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a57d00065fda65ee9363796af48817ec9a44647d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,125,0,6,95,218,101,238,147,99,121,106,244,136,23,236,154,68,100,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
