This Chicago transplant is on her way in matching the conviction of some of her influences (Carole King, James Taylor) while imposing a majestic, jazz-tinged rock sound. Beth Orton and Leona Naess have made a strong impression thus far, and Yamagata intends on joining them with this stunning six-song EP. She is vintage cool in a modern world of solo artists, and songs like &quot;Collide&quot; and &quot;Known for Years&quot; are strong in spirit. She may only be in her early twenties, but Yamagata is a weathered soul with a sophisticated frame of mind. The achingly beautiful &quot;Worn Me Down&quot; laments over twisted romance and Yamagata's sultry delivery soothes such pain for one of her most impressive songs yet. Her true talent lies in telling a story because Yamagata is able to take the listener to another place. Whether or not that place is comfortable or ill at ease, Yamagata cares enough to make it a solid experience for both she and whoever wants to hear about it. That in itself suggests that Rachael Yamagata is ready to belong.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/08/06/rachael-yamagata/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/08/06/rachael-yamagata/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fb9f0063014de4748c7e09ebf4453a68d8b9088","amp;dn":"Rachael+Yamagata...EP%282003%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fb9f0063014de4748c7e09ebf4453a68d8b9088","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,185,240,6,48,20,222,71,72,199,224,158,191,68,83,166,141,139,144,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
