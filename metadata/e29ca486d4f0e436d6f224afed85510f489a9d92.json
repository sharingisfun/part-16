You want to bury those bastards six feet under for what they have done to you, but to do so you need to start your own gang and recruit right from the streets. If a new gang member turns out to be a punk, blast him, and make room for new ones. Move up in the world, but watch out for the Kingpin, eventually you're going to have to take him on.\n\nSomewhere in the past that never crossed paths with the future lies the world of the Kingpin. Burned out buildings and urban decay are the landscape. Local gangs roam the streets, protecting their turf and scooping out opportunities.\n\nRecruit a gang of thugs and rule the streets, snuff out rivals with a single head-shot and watch them bleed to death. Or put them on fire and watch them suffer. You will deliver an extremely brutal and violent death to those who messed you up. Kill everyone who stands in your way and become new Kingpin - crime lord of every thief, murderer and dirty thug in the city.\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.\n\nWAITING ON THE REQUEST LIST TO BE UPLOADED:\n\nFAR CRY\nFAR CRY 2: FORTUNE'S EDITION\nMEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT WAR CHEST\t\nGOTHIC 1, 2, 3\nIN COLD BLOOD\nHEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC 5 BUNDLE\nINQUISITOR\nDaikatana\nMessiah\nChildren of the Nile Complete\nSyberia 1+2\nStill Life 1\nGhost Master\nGemini Rue\nTo The Moon\nDarwinia\nAlan Wake American Nightmare\nPainkiller Black Edition\nTwo Worlds 1+2\n\n--------------\nREQUESTS THAT I CAN'T FULFILL AT THE MOMENT\n\nLeisure Suit Larry Language Pack\nDon't Starve\nKing of Dragon Pass\nGalactic Civilizations I Ultimate Edition\nThe Cat Lady\nJourneyman Project 3\nDYAD\nSword of the Stars: The Pit\nEtherlords 2\nBioforge\nAvernum: The Complete Saga\nRetro City Rampage\n\n\n\n--------------\n\nIF POSSIBLE, DON'T FORGET TO SUPPORT THE COMPANIES AND GOG.COM FOR THEIR GREAT SERVICE.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e29ca486d4f0e436d6f224afed85510f489a9d92","amp;dn":"Kingpin+-+Life+of+Crime+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e29ca486d4f0e436d6f224afed85510f489a9d92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,156,164,134,212,240,228,54,214,242,36,175,237,133,81,15,72,154,157,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
