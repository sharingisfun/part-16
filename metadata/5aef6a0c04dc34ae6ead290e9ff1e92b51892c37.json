This is a scene that does a disservice\nto the victims of Auschwitz in particular and has no grounding in historical\nfact in such degree as to cause a valid generalization to be inferred as valid\nfrom what is depicted as perhaps even an isolated incident, when in fact the\nchances of such a travesty ever occurring among the members of the community\nwould be a rank offence probably never heard of in the entire history of the\nculture of the peoples there. I therefore have to ask why its posited as a\nvalid incident for purposes of giving impressions of what was possible or\nprobable at least to the extent of justifying a key scene in the movie that was\nmost memorable for many that would have seen it as that is the level of\ndissonance that would be involved for an ordinary viewer of any persuasion at\nall, on the historical events of the holocaust.\n\nWhen I first saw this movie my inclination was that it should be pulled off\nshelves and not sold for any profits whatever. that remains my view today, and\nI think all that get to see this movie should be warned that it is in fact not\na very nice treatment of the issues involved and as such should be taken with a\ngrain of salt with a view of never making an unsupervised movie in Hollywood\nagain, since it likely wouldn't pass censors that would look for obvious\nmiscarriage of justice issues that would be involved in inflicting these images\non mankind.\n\nWe have all become desensitized to viewing unpleasant images on the movie\nscreen of late given new found egalitarian ideals and what have you that\nchallenge what have been perspectives of relative merit and fairness based\nthereon, etc so that the particular mindset that wishes to see insensitivity\nwin the day, inanity prevail, that is the mindset that wins, and that can be\nthe only agenda here. we go too far with these views and I for one would like\nto see a return to morality and good taste on such matters as involve us here\nwith this movie choice.\n\nThe more you accept of unpleasant images around you that defy your sense of\ngood judgment, the more you accept the sort of world that is advocated by the\ninane who have an agenda to see this through. Best to call a spade a spade and\nsay, I've had enough of this, please stop.\n\nPS\n\nI also would as well like to suggest to all that we maintain perspective on the\nsubject matter, in that examples of the most beautiful Germanic spirits that\nare on earth such as the angelic Ms. Jessica Lange, and others in what is in\nfact Germany, shouldnt be tainted with what they couldnt tolerate if in fact\nconfronted with the facts. They all see Hitler equally as a madman indeed. I\nhave no doubt whatsoever that this was just a sad abherration in our history\nas humanity and that we should learn to put it in perspective as sins of the\npast by those involved.\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nPlease see my reviews at moviesbyrizzo.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5aef6a0c04dc34ae6ead290e9ff1e92b51892c37","amp;dn":"The+Pianist+%282002%29+multisubs+720+X+480+resolution+enhanced+audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5aef6a0c04dc34ae6ead290e9ff1e92b51892c37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,239,106,12,4,220,52,174,110,173,41,14,159,241,233,43,81,137,44,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
