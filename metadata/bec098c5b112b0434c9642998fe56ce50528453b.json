The ISO Format is a Disc Image containing the data to be written to disc.\n\nNearly all CD/DVD Burning software supports burning the ISO format to disc because it is a common format. However, if you are confused on how to burn an ISO to disc, I suggest using the &quot;BurnAware Free&quot; (freeware, contains no crap-ware) available at http://www.burnaware.com/burnaware_free.html\n\nAlternately, you can mount the ISO in a virtual drive. You can download a Virtual Drive Program called &quot;Virtual CloneDrive&quot; (freeware, contains no crap-ware) available at http://www.slysoft.com/en/virtual-clonedrive.html\n\nFinally, if you would prefer to extract the data from the ISO to a folder your hard drive, you can use ISOBuster (shareware, unlimited demo) available at http://www.isobuster.com/\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nMinimum System Requirements:\n\nPentium 3 600 MHz or AMD equivalent \n256 MB RAM \nMicrosoft Windows 98/ME/2000/XP/Vista (compatible with 64-bit)\nDirectX compatible 3D hardware accelerator card with HT&amp;L Support \nDirectX compatible 16-bit or higher sound card \n2 gigbytes hard drive space (2.9 gigbytes with Campaign Pack installed)\nJoystick or GamePad Recommended\nDirectX 8.1 or higher\nOpenAL 1.1 or higher\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor more see http://www.hard-light.net/forums/index.php/topic,56246.0.html\n\nFor Multiplayer Support go here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hard-light.net/forums/index.php/topic,52243.0.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hard-light.net/forums/index.php/topic,52243.0.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor Multiplayer Times go here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hard-light.net/forums/index.php/topic,52290.0.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hard-light.net/forums/index.php/topic,52290.0.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor Linux and Mac Support: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hard-light.net/forums/index.php/topic,40036.0.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hard-light.net/forums/index.php/topic,40036.0.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpecial thanks to everyone involved in making The Babylon Project and the DVD a reality!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nhip63","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bec098c5b112b0434c9642998fe56ce50528453b","amp;dn":"The+Babylon+Project+v3.4b+DVD+v1.0+Space+Simulator+Combat+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bec098c5b112b0434c9642998fe56ce50528453b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,192,152,197,177,18,176,67,76,150,66,153,143,229,108,229,5,40,69,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
