What we requested from the Port Authority of New York New Jersey was in essence a surprise occupancy audit of the World Trade Center. What we requested; We make no claims other then these below. Another FOIA will be sent within the next few days, at which time we will then audit this list that we received against the new FOIA request for the same thing.\n\n1. A complete listing of all occupants of the world trade center, from the time they were finished to the time they went private, in 2001.\n\n2. Listing of occupants by floor and by space\n\n3. Listing of occupants leases, with the start and end dates of those leases.\n\n\nWhat we received back was shocking and in no way anticipated. Please open this spreadsheet now in another browser tab, so you can have this open and go back and forth as your reading this story. (right click, open link in new tab)\n\n\nTo see the FOIA request spreadsheet and the rest of the story please see it here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://letsrollforums.co","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ccabb5ca34ae2cac99a523133c65170f9293409","amp;dn":"9%2F11+PRESS+RELEASE%3A+World+Trade+Center+Occupancy+FOIA+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ccabb5ca34ae2cac99a523133c65170f9293409","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,202,187,92,163,74,226,202,201,154,82,49,51,198,81,112,249,41,52,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
