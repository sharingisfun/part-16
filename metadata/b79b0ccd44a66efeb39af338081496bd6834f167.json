The book explores the visual arrangement of words and letters in the context of multimedia. Here, this arrangement is not simply a spatial positioning of text information it is also bound by time. The increasing use of moving, virtual type can help to harmonise this time-based presentation of words on screen. The book touches on work from a variety of designers, including Channel 4 and Pentagram Design. This will provide an excellent introduction to the latest methods in typographical and visual communication.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b79b0ccd44a66efeb39af338081496bd6834f167","amp;dn":"Virtual+Typography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b79b0ccd44a66efeb39af338081496bd6834f167","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,155,12,205,68,166,110,254,179,154,243,56,8,20,150,189,104,52,241,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
