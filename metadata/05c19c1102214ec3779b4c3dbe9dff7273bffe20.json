He is respected by his neighbors and always ready to give them a helping hand. Although not a churchgoer, he even helps a newly arrived local minister regain his flock after he and Clay get into a bit of trouble. If he has one dream in life it's to build his wife Olivia a beautiful house on a piece of land he inherited on Spender's mountain. When his eldest son, Clayboy, graduates at the top of his high school class and has the opportunity to go to college, Clay has only one option left to him.              \n\nACTORS: \nHenry Fonda, Maureen O'Hara, James MacArthur, Donald Crisp, Wally Cox, Mimsy Farmer, \n\nRELEASED: \n 16 May 1963 \n\nIMDB: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057523/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057523/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n Size: 2013149146 bytes (1.87 GiB), duration: 01:58:26, avg.bitrate: 2266 kb/s\nAudio: ac3, 48000 Hz, mono (eng)\nVideo: h264, yuv420p, 720x366, 23.98 fps(r) =&gt; 853x366 (eng)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=86801417607448212257.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=86801417607448212257.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=86394767665938227981.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=86394767665938227981.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=15477198218100196385.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=15477198218100196385.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n \n\n\n\nDOWNLOAD AND ENJOY. \n\n KEEP IT FOR LONG SEEDING TO HELP OTHERS \n\n \n Thanks to : HANDJOB\n Movie Share ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05c19c1102214ec3779b4c3dbe9dff7273bffe20","amp;dn":"Spencers+Mountain+1963+DVDRip+x264-HANDJOB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05c19c1102214ec3779b4c3dbe9dff7273bffe20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,193,156,17,2,33,78,195,119,155,76,61,190,157,255,114,115,191,254,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
