Formats: AZW3, EPUB, MOBI. Published 2010. (Warning!!! Adult content.)\r\n\r\nMostly fiction. Tags: Australian, Humor, Jokes, Limericks, Poetry, Verse\r\nisbn:9781742373270 \r\n\r\nEveryone knows at least one limerick. Here are all the limericks you can remember, and many you can't recall but wished you could â€” from childhood ones to some very adult ones. Jim Haynes has arranged more than a thousand limericks according to type â€” witty and whimsical, childish and charming, linguistic and logical, fair dinkum and funny, barmy and British. Australian idols and icons, place names, and prime ministers are paraded in all their historical and satirical glory.\r\n\r\nSome limericks, however witty, are joyfully risquÃ©, vulgar, or even downright crude â€” thoughtfully placed categories ranging from mildly impolite and immodest to those obscene and odious examples beloved of rugby clubs and teenage boys of all ages. All show that the limerick is a celebration of life, nonsense, and lusciously lecherous energy.\r\n\r\nA sample from the book which aptly describes some of the limericks that follow:\r\nThe limerick is furtive and mean;\r\nYou must keep her in close quarantine,\r\n. . Or she sneaks to the slums\r\n. . And promptly becomes\r\nDisorderly, drunk and obscene.\r\n\r\nMy previous book of limericks:\r\n../torrent/11490278/The_Penguin_Book_of_Limericks_-_E.O._Parrott__AZW3__EPUB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26e9e701a18586558cc6552004f0801fcd271060","amp;dn":"The+Great+Australian+Book+of+Limericks-Jim+Haynes+AZW3+EPUB+MOBI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26e9e701a18586558cc6552004f0801fcd271060","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,233,231,1,161,133,134,85,140,198,85,32,4,240,128,31,205,39,16,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
