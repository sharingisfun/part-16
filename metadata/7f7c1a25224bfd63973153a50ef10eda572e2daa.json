At the center of the film, written by Stone and Quentin Tarantino, among others, are Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory (Juliette Lewis), a young couple united by their desire for each other and their common love of violence. Together, they embark on a record-breaking, exceptionally gory killing spree that captivates the sensation-hungry tabloid media. Their fame is ensured by one newsman, Wayne Gale (Robert Downey, Jr.), who reports on Mickey and Mallory for his show, American Maniacs. Even the duo's eventual capture by the police only increases their notoriety, as Gale develops a plan for a Super Bowl Sunday interview that Mickey and Mallory twist to their own advantage.\n\nDirector:\nOliver Stone\n\nWriters:\nQuentin Tarantino (story), David Veloz (screenplay)\n\nStars:\nWoody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Tom Sizemore\n\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110632\n\nRotten Tomatoes: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/natural_born_killers/\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f7c1a25224bfd63973153a50ef10eda572e2daa","amp;dn":"Natural.Born.Killers.%281994%29.BRrip.%28MKV%29.sammyBOblammy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f7c1a25224bfd63973153a50ef10eda572e2daa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,124,26,37,34,75,253,99,151,49,83,165,14,241,14,218,87,46,45,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
