Many beautiful and poignant songs are included such as the Growling Tiger's &quot;The Gold in Africa&quot; (about Italy's invasion of Ethiopia) and &quot;Money Is King&quot; (about the depression), Executor's &quot;Shop Closing Ordinance,&quot; the Roaring Lion's &quot;Bargee Pelauri,&quot; Atilla's &quot;Commission's Report&quot; (about a British report of the riot of the striking oil field workers), and Radio's &quot;Sedition Law&quot; (about the censorship of calypso).~Don Hill (Allmusic)\n\n01.
