Real bad.\n\nThe Kansas City law firm, Sullivan &amp; Christenson, where Lou Mason has worked for the past three months specializes in protecting clients from certain taxes by merging and acquiring their assets. When Mason discovers that SullivanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s moral compass is a little off, he begins to re-think working for the firm. He tells himself heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll think it over at the upcoming firm retreat. While at the retreat, Sheriff Kelly Holt interrupts his poolside siesta to tell him his partner is dead. \n\nThe death of his partner sets off an avalanche of events that culminate in Mason being framed for a series of crimes he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t commit. To save himself, Mason uncovers high-level corruption, takes on organized crime, and is targeted for murder. Follow Mason as he fights to stay alive. \n\nWarning Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Motion to Kill isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t for the faint of heart.
