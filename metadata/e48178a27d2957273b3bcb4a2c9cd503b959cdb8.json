This newly compiled collection of Yoder's lectures and writings on these issues describes, analyzes, and evaluates various patterns of thought and practice in Western Christian history. The volume, now made widely available for the first time, makes Yoder's stimulating insights more accessible to a broader audience and substantially contributes to ongoing discussions concerning the history, theology, and ethics of war and peace. Theologians and ethicists, students of Yoder's thought, and all readers seeking a better understanding of war and pacifism will value this work","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e48178a27d2957273b3bcb4a2c9cd503b959cdb8","amp;dn":"Christian+Attitudes+to+War%2C+Peace%2C+and+Revolution","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e48178a27d2957273b3bcb4a2c9cd503b959cdb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,129,120,162,125,41,87,39,59,59,203,74,44,156,213,3,185,89,205,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
