A DB firmware is a slightly modified OFW, that will allow you to install and return to CFW. This is only of use for CFW user's and will not magically jailbreak a system that does not have CFW installed. The purpose of this firmware is to give better protection against bans on PSN. Install this PUP and play your game from disc with a reduced risk of a ban. So if you are nervous or worried about a PSN ban when connecting with a CFW. Then this is a great route for online gaming on PSN with your exploited console.
