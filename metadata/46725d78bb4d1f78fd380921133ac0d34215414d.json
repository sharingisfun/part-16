In his active, fertile, writer's imagination, we see (and hear as he narrates) the stories of his daily life, as they should be, could be, might be, and even actually how they are. Andy shares his office with the company's newest employee, and Andy's newest friend, the frail, jumpy, odd, loveable Byron. Also inhabiting Andy's world is his best friend Keith, who is &quot;so good looking&quot; that Andy must fight his own &quot;prejudice against the 'attractive,' who seem to get everything they want, unlike ordinary humans.&quot; Supervisor Jessica is also Andy's longtime friend and uses her lightening sharp tongue to keep the group out of, or at times, to get the group INTO trouble. The newer receptionist Wendy (Irene Molloy, &quot;Grosse Pointe&quot;), whom Andy first had a crush on, is dating Keith (somewhat proving Andy's &quot;Attractive Theory&quot;). \n\n\n\nAndy.Richter.Controls.The.Universe.S01E01.Pilot.DVDRip.x264-Liebe_Ist\nAndy.Richter.Controls.The.Universe.S01E02.Grief.Counselor.DVDRip.x264-Liebe_Ist\nAndy.Richter.Controls.The.Universe.S01E03.Little.Andy.In.Charge.DVDRip.x264-Liebe_Ist\nAndy.Richter.Controls.The.Universe.S01E04.Second.Episode.DVDRip.x264-Liebe_Ist\nAndy.Richter.Controls.The.Universe.S01E05.Gimme.A.C.DVDRip.x264-Liebe_Ist\nAndy.Richter.Controls.The.Universe.S01E06.Wedding.DVDRip.x264-Liebe_Ist\n\nFORMAT.......................: MKV\nCODEC........................: X264\nGENRE........................: Comedy\nFILE SIZE....................: 1.37 GB\nRESOLUTION...................: 852/840*480\nFRAME RATE...................: 29.97 fps\nLANGUAGE.....................: English\nSUBTITLES....................: NONE\nRUNTIME......................: 133 mins\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46725d78bb4d1f78fd380921133ac0d34215414d","amp;dn":"Andy+Richter+Controls+the+Universe+S1+DVDRip+Paget+Brewster+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46725d78bb4d1f78fd380921133ac0d34215414d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,114,93,120,187,77,31,120,253,56,9,33,19,58,192,211,66,21,65,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
