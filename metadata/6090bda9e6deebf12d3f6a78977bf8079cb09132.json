Length : 100min         \n\n\n What do a Transylvanian transvestite, a cryogenically-preserved motorbiker   \n and a Frankenstein&amp;#039;s monster wearing golden underpants all have in common?   \n They&amp;#039;re all crucial parts of Rocky Horror Picture Show, the comedy cult      \n classic which is at once hysterical, indispensable and truly disturbing.     \n Innocent young lovers Brad and Janet are stranded when their car breaks      \n down, so they are forced to seek refuge in the castle of the bizarre Dr.     \n Frankenfurter, who is having a gathering of some kind... What ensues is an   \n unforgettable night of music and madness where, like a circus act, you       \n never know what&amp;#039;s going to come next. Adding to the madness is the           \n narration of the soporific Professor, who, in omnipotence, recounts the      \n whole story from the comfort of his genteel study. Of course, there are      \n pre-designed spots for audience participation - from being doused with       \n spray bottles to throwing popcorn at the screen to getting up from your      \n seat and dancing along to the incomparable &quot;Time Warp&quot;. By the end of the    \n night, fantasies will be realities, men will be women and everything will    \n be explained - or will it?!?!?                                               \n                                                                              \n\n\n                           Happy Hacker Industries                            \nThis movie should play fine on most DVD/DivX Certified settop\ndvd players.
