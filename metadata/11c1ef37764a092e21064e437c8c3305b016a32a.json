Verve Jazz Masters 3, for example, consists of 14 examples drawn from seven Chick Corea LPs released on the Polydor label during the years 1972-1978.  Six of these come from Corea's Return to Forever period.  The backbone of this collection (tracks one, seven, ten and fourteen) are selections from the highly acclaimed album Light as a Feather (1972) and there are excerpts from Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy (1973) and No Mystery (1975).  The other eight titles are traceable to Corea's theatrically costumed and somewhat heavy-handed production albums The Leprechaun (1975), My Spanish Heart (1976), Friends (1978 ) and The Mad Hatter (1978 ).  This disc will be useful as a vintage jazz fusion sampler or more specifically as an overview of what Chick Corea was up to during the Nixon/Ford/Carter years. ~ arwulf arwulf, AMG\n\nThis album changed my life.  Although it is now out-of-print, this album is worth travelling around the world to find.  I really suggest looking up the (currently) 4 that are left on amazon.  This album features most of Chick's greatest compositions and displays his genius in perfect form.  I first heard this album at my University's library and unable to check it out of the building,  taped it.  I WORE THE TAPE OUT.  You know what ... if you can find this album, LET ME KNOW !! (Don't own a C.C.) This is quite possibly the most wicked collection in all of Jazz Fusion. A MUST FIND AND A MUST BUY. ~ Blazing Arrow 74\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 03 - Chick Corea Tracks:\n01 YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re Everything 5:13\n02  Lenore 3:28 \n03  Space Circus (Part One) 1:33\n04  Friends 9:28 \n05  Night Streets 6:03\n06  ChildrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Song No. 15 1:13\n07  Spain 9:52\n08  Interplay 2:18 \n09  Nite Sprite 4:35\n10  Light As A Feather 10:59\n11  Tweedle Dee 1:10\n12  Wind Danse 4:59\n13  My Spanish Heart 1:40\n14  Captain Marvel 4:52\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11c1ef37764a092e21064e437c8c3305b016a32a","amp;dn":"Verve+Jazz+Masters+03+-+Chick+Corea+%281994%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+160%5D%5Bh33t%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11c1ef37764a092e21064e437c8c3305b016a32a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,193,239,55,118,74,9,46,33,6,78,67,124,140,51,5,176,22,163,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
