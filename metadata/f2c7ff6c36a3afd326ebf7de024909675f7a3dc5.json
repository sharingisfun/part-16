The factories in northern Europe that produced glass a la faÃƒÂ§on de Venise are represented as well. Robert Lehman also acquired perhaps the richest American collection of eighteenth-century lampworked glass figurines, which are usually attributed to Nevers, France. Smaller groups of reverse-painted panels and ancient Roman and early Islamic glass round out the 136 objects catalogued in this volume.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2c7ff6c36a3afd326ebf7de024909675f7a3dc5","amp;dn":"Glass+in+The+Robert+Lehman+Collection+Vol+11+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2c7ff6c36a3afd326ebf7de024909675f7a3dc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,199,255,108,54,163,175,211,38,235,247,222,2,73,9,103,95,122,61,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
