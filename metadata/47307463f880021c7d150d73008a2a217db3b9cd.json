He has won the ECHO-award (2002) for the Best Dance-Single of the Year . Christopher Von Deylen doesn't provide vocals for any of his compositions, instead he chooses to collaborate with singers from within and outside of Germany. Musicians and vocalists who have worked with von Deylen include: German actor and musician Ben Becker, Irish singer Moya Brennan of the Celtic group Clannad and sister to international new age star Enya, The Biggest Selling Soprano Sarah Brightman, Peter Heppner of the German synth pop band Wolfsheim, miLÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹, Xavier Naidoo, Maya Saban, Kim Sanders formerly of Culture Beat, Ana Torroja, lead singer of the Spanish pop group Mecano, Tarja Turunen, former frontwoman of Finnish symphonic power metal group Nightwish, Greek singer Despina Vandi, and Alexander Veljanov of German Darkwave group Deine Lakaien, as well as other electronic-music musicians including Klaus Schulze, Mike Oldfield and others.\n\n\n\nIt has often taken a year or longer for Schiller to release the North American editions of their albums most likely due to having some of the German-language tracks re-recorded in English or contain exclusive or previously unreleased material. European countries, however see Schiller's releases much sooner, usually within a month or so. After the North American release of Life, Christopher Von Deylen stated that he did not wish to continue mixing English translations of the German language tracks.\n\n\n\nThe name of the band is taken from one of von Deylen's heroes, famed German poet Friedrich Schiller\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n\n01 Welcome 1:06\n\n02 Nightflight 6:59\n\n03 Morning Dew 4:03\n\n04 Drifting And Dreaming 4:23\n\n05 What's Coming 4:32\n\n06 Schiller 7:20\n\n07 I Saved You 4:34\n\n08 I Know 5:08\n\n09 Distance 7:20\n\n10 Fireworks 6:10\n\n11 Misguiding Light 5:58\n\n12 Sleepy Storm 5:20\n\n13 Der Tag...
