Some of this energy is simply a projection of your bio-electric field, and all it tells them is Ã¢â‚¬Å“something living is near meÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.  But there is more to your aura.  Much more.\n\nYou project, and others can subconsciously sense, a lot of information about yourself through your aura, including your emotional state and what you believe about yourself.  Because of this, and the fact that others do subconsciously sense and respond to this auric information, you can use subliminals to adjust your aura by telling your subconscious mind what you want it to Ã¢â‚¬Å“sayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.  The result?  Others will sense and respond to what you consciously want them to sense and respond to.  They will begin treating you the way you want them to.\n\nIn this case, you can tell your subconscious mind that you want others to percieve you as being sexy, and respond appropriately.  This title can be used by either gender, and can be used successfully by anyone of any sexual orientation. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dc01ddc6533fc6bbcd2a53398b138ac7291dbbc","amp;dn":"Develop+An+Aura+Of+Sexiness+2.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dc01ddc6533fc6bbcd2a53398b138ac7291dbbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,192,29,220,101,51,252,107,188,210,165,51,152,177,56,172,114,145,219,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
