In retrospect, The Temptations' Otis Williams considers &quot;Papa&quot; to be the last real classic the group recorded.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:598048ff9ac02616a352396b74c26effb3d3ae3c","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+495","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"598048ff9ac02616a352396b74c26effb3d3ae3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,128,72,255,154,192,38,22,163,82,57,107,116,194,110,255,179,211,174,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
