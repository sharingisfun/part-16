Versailles is therefore famous not only as a building, but as a symbol of the system of absolute monarchy of the Ancien RÃƒÂ©gime.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3bbbee5d2d61b9253568429abf31845976c7861","amp;dn":"Versailles+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3bbbee5d2d61b9253568429abf31845976c7861","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,187,190,229,210,214,27,146,83,86,132,41,171,243,24,69,151,108,120,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
