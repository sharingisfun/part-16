I decided to upload it here because i don't find the original torrent and it is quite a pitty that this video is nowhere to be found on the internet as it is supposed to be seen.\n\nfor a quick view please go to vimeo at http://www.vimeo.com/7809605 and see 12 minutes of pure awesomeness, however if you really want quality then downliad from here.\n\nalso there are videos that show excerpts from the making of the film, if you're curious how or if you have doubts that this is a full CGI.\n\nas an alternative there is http://www.thirdseventh.com where you can find lots of stills from the movie that look perfect for wallpapers and such.\n\nauthor comments:\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n.Fullscreen it, please.\n\nA FULL-CG animated piece that tries to illustrate architecture art across a photographic point of view where main subjects\nare already-built spaces. Sometimes in an abstract way. Sometimes surreal.\n\nCredits:\n\nCG\n\n|Modelling - Texturing - Illumination - Rendering| Alex Roman\n\nPOST\n\n|Postproduction &amp; Editing| Alex Roman\n\nMUSIC\n\nSequenced, Orchestrated &amp; Mixed by Alex Roman (Sonar &amp; EWQLSO Gold Pro XP)\n\nSound Design by Alex Roman\n\nBased on original scores by:\n\n.Michael Laurence Edward Nyman.
