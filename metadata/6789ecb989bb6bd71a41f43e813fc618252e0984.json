Slave to the Grind is notable for being the first heavy metal album to debut at #1 on the Billboard 200 during the SoundScan era.\n\nTwo different versions were released: the original version, and the &quot;clean&quot; (censored) version. The clean version replaced the song &quot;Get the Fuck Out&quot; with the less-offensive &quot;Beggar's Day&quot;.\n\nSlave to the Grind marked the band's move towards a heavier sound. The lyrics were more complex, criticizing modern ways of life, authority, politics, drugs, and organized religion, among other topics.\n\nSebastian Bach's father painted the cover art, which is actually a long mural, continued inside the album's booklet. It is set in the medieval era (inspired by Caravaggio's Burial of St. Lucy (1608), yet has people using modern technological gadgets. John F. Kennedy is in the crowd.\n\nIt was voted Album of the Year in the 1991 Metal Edge Readers' Choice Awards.\nMusic videos were produced for the four singles &quot;Monkey Business&quot;, &quot;Slave to the Grind&quot;, &quot;Wasted Time&quot; and &quot;In a Darkened Room&quot; as well as the song &quot;Quicksand Jesus&quot; all of which feature on the video album No Frills Video.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t\n1. \t&quot;Monkey Business&quot;   \t \t4:20\n2. \t&quot;Slave to the Grind&quot;    \t3:31\n3. \t&quot;The Threat&quot;   \t\t        3:52\n4. \t&quot;Quicksand Jesus&quot;   \t \t5:26\n5. \t&quot;Psycho Love&quot;   \t \t3:58\n6. \t&quot;Get the Fuck Out&quot;  \t\t2:42\n7. \t&quot;Livin' on a Chain Gang&quot;    \t4:00\n8. \t&quot;Creepshow&quot;   \t\t        3:59\n9. \t&quot;In a Darkened Room&quot; (Ã¢â‚¬Â )  \t3:57\n10. \t&quot;Riot Act&quot;   \t \t        2:42\n11. \t&quot;Mudkicker&quot;   \t \t        3:56\n12. \t&quot;Wasted Time&quot;   \t \t5:50\n\n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6789ecb989bb6bd71a41f43e813fc618252e0984","amp;dn":"Skid+Row+-+Slave+to+The+Grind%28OriginalRelease%29%5B320kbs%5D%7E%7ERenovati","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6789ecb989bb6bd71a41f43e813fc618252e0984","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,137,236,185,137,187,107,215,26,65,244,62,129,63,198,24,37,46,9,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
