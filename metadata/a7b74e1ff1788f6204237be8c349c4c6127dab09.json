Hailing from Kings Cliffe, Northamptonshire, brothers Ben (vocals) and Ross (guitar) Duffy had been making music on their home computer since their early teens, but in 2006 they decided to form a band, recruiting friends Daniel Soler (bass) and Andrew Lindsay (drums). Citing Michael Jackson's Dangerous as their main influence, the group began writing songs that they describe as &quot;glam, psychedelic, zouk pop&quot; and released an EP produced by Moloko's Mark Brydon. After signing to Moda Music, the band remixed tracks for Marina &amp; the Diamonds and Example, while Ben provided vocals for &quot;Paper Romance,&quot; a track on Groove Armada's Black Light album. In 2010, they released their self-titled debut album, which featured the three singles &quot;The Cult of Romance,&quot; &quot;Stop and Stare,&quot; and &quot;Lies.&quot; In 2013, Fenech-Soler returned with Rituals, which featured the singles, &quot;Magnetic&quot; and &quot;Last Forever.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7b74e1ff1788f6204237be8c349c4c6127dab09","amp;dn":"Fenech-Soler+-+Rituals+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7b74e1ff1788f6204237be8c349c4c6127dab09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,183,78,31,241,120,143,98,4,35,123,232,195,73,196,198,18,125,171,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
