As long as parenthesis don&amp;#039;t mess up your library it should be fine.\nHave fun.\n\nTracks:\n\nGod Be Merciful to Me (Psalm 51)\nI Need Thee Every Hour\nGod Will Lift Up Your Head\nI&amp;#039;ll Fly Away (Featuring Sarah Kelly)\nNothing But the Blood (Featuring The Blind Boys of Alabama)\nLet Us Love and Sing and Wonder (Featuring Martin Smith of Delirious)\nO Come and Mourn With Me Awhile\nHiding Place\nJesus, I Lift My Eyes\nIt Is Well With My Soul\nOn Jordan&amp;#039;s Stormy Banks I Stand (Featuring The Blind Boys of Alabama)\nThy Lovely Source of True Delight\nThey Will Know We are Christians By Our Love\n\nNot an album I really cared for, but maybe a &amp;#039;Jars of Clay&amp;#039; fan would like it.\nSeed it or I&amp;#039;ll stick a livewire up your nostrils.
