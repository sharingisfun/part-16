Brackett and Billy Wilder) about a free-wheeling millionaire, Michael Brandon (Gary Cooper), who enjoys getting married but has a hard time staying married: he's had seven wives and is looking for number eight. He thinks he may have found her in the person of Nicole de Loiselle (Claudette Colbert), whom he meets in a shop on the French Riviera. Unfortunately for Michael, Nicole doesn't like him very much and keeps rebuffing his advances, even though most women would be only too happy to marry him for his money. For just that reason, Nicole's father (Edward Everett Horton), a financially embarrassed French nobleman, strongly suggests that matrimony with Michael would be a good idea, especially since Michael doesn't want to take no for an answer. Nicole eventually relents and weds Michael, but when she tries to get him to change a few of his habits during the honeymoon, he makes plans to divorce her. But Nicole has finally decided that she loves Michael after all, and, as he tries to flee from her, she gives chase, determined to win his heart once and for all.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Bluebeard's Eighth Wife (1938).avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 897 MiB\n      Duration : 1h 25mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 466 Kbps\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 25mn\n      Bit rate : 1 350 Kbps\n      Width : 592 pixels\n      Height : 448 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.212\n      Stream size : 826 MiB (92%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 25mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 103 Kbps\n      Nominal bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 63.3 MiB (7%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 178 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.98r\n      Encoding settings : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 --abr 128\n\nIMDB: tt0029929\n\nEnglish audio; English, Spanish, French subpack (idx/sub), Portuguese srt subtitles\n\nPosted at Karagarga by Inkyabyss","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d36cadeb1787250a6ae743c09e85ef627b8dc5f1","amp;dn":"Bluebeard%5C%27s+Eighth+Wife+%281938%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d36cadeb1787250a6ae743c09e85ef627b8dc5f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,108,173,235,23,135,37,10,106,231,67,192,158,133,239,98,123,141,197,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
