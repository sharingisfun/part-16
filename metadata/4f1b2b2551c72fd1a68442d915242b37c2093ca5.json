The constant in the band has been Slim Cessna, formerly a member of The Denver Gentlemen along with David Eugene Edwards and Jeffery-Paul of 16 Horsepower. Jay Munly (often credited as Munly Munly) is also a key member of the current lineup of the band. In addition to contributing songwriting, vocals, and banjo, he also serves as a sidekick to Cessna on stage.\n \nTheir music includes elements of country blues, Southern gospel, gothabilly and other forms loosely grouped as Americana or alternative country. The Auto Club is sometimes labeled country Gothic due to the juxtaposition of apocalyptic religious imagery with stories of alcohol, violence, and relationships gone awry.\n\n- This is the country band that plays the bar at the end of the world  -\nJello Biafra","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f1b2b2551c72fd1a68442d915242b37c2093ca5","amp;dn":"Slim+Cessnas+Auto+Club+-+American+Country+Music..+%281998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f1b2b2551c72fd1a68442d915242b37c2093ca5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,27,43,37,81,199,47,209,166,132,66,217,21,36,43,55,194,9,60,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
