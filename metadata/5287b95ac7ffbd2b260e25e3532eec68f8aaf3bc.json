After the lackluster sales of Hotter Than Hell Casablanca owner Neil Bogart decided the band needed a new record and one with a hit. While the record was recorded in early February 1975 at Electric Lady Studios in New York City, the band did do some initial work at Larrabee Studios in Hollywood, California from January 1975 and is the source for the first four songs on this set. \n\nThe sound for all four songs is excellent soundboard, a little dull sounding but consistent throughout, the inside cover lists them as being from January 3 where the excellent KISS alive forever places them from January 24-25..(Info taken from collectorsmusicreviews).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5287b95ac7ffbd2b260e25e3532eec68f8aaf3bc","amp;dn":"Kiss+1975+Kill+%26amp%3B+Destroy+FLAC+Demos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5287b95ac7ffbd2b260e25e3532eec68f8aaf3bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,135,185,90,199,255,189,43,38,14,37,227,83,46,236,104,248,170,243,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
