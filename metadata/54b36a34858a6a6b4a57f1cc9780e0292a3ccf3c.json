Eminem - No Apologies           4:18\n\nRelease Notes:\n\nEminem Presents: The Re-Up (Shady Records/Interscope Records), began as a street\nmixtape project--an underground, unofficial CD with raw production\nvalues--designed to help launch new Shady Records artists Stat Quo, Ca$his and\nBobby Creekwater. &quot;But what happened is that the material was so good and the\ntracks were getting produced like a regular album,&quot; said Eminem. &quot;Instead of\nputting it out there rough and unfinished, I thought we should add some other new\ntracks, make it a real album, and put it in the record stores to give these new\nartists a real boost.&quot; The album was executive produced by Eminem, who also\nproduced the majority of the songs. A handful of selections were produced by The\nAlchemist, who also compiled the album in true mixtape fashion. The Alchemist is\nbest known for his work with Cypress Hill, Nas, Snoop Dogg, Mobb Deep, and\nJadakiss.\n\nEach of the tracks makes its official CD debut on Eminem Presents: The Re-Up,\nthough Stat Quo&amp;#039;s &quot;Billion Bucks,&quot; and Obie Trice&amp;#039;s &quot;Cry Now&quot; (Remix), produced\nby LT Moe, was recently released on mixtapes and to radio. The first single and\nvideo will be &quot;You Don&amp;#039;t Know&quot; from Eminem, 50 Cent, Ca$his and Lloyd Banks. With\nEminem and Ca$his from the Shady camp and 50 Cent and Lloyd Banks from G-Unit,\nthe rap illustrates the unity of the two organizations.\n\nThe Re-Up also gave acclaimed hip-hop producer The Alchemist a chance to work\nwith Shady&amp;#039;s new regime. After joining forces on-stage as Eminem&amp;#039;s DJ on last\nyear&amp;#039;s Anger Management 3 tour, Alchemist and the Shady camp began collaborating\nin the studio. This new album features the results of this anticipated\ncollaboration with new tracks produced by The Alchemist featuring Stat Quo,\nCa$his, Bobby Creekwater and Obie Trice.\n\nAmong the album&amp;#039;s other recordings are &quot;No Apologies&quot; from Eminem; &quot;Talkin&amp;#039; All\nThat&quot; from Ca$his; &quot;City Of Gold&quot; from Bobby Creekwater; &quot;Murder&quot; from Bizarre\nand Kuniva (both of D12); and The &quot;Smack That (Remix)&quot; with Akon.\n\nStat Quo, hailing from Atlanta, was signed to a joint deal between Shady Records\nand Dr. Dre&amp;#039;s Aftermath Entertainment after Eminem and Dre heard him on the\nUnderground Atlanta mixtape series. Creekwater, also from Atlanta, was inked\nafter Eminem heard his work on demos and in the studio with The Alchemist.\nCa$his, a Chicago native transplanted in his youth to Orange Co., California,\nwas a member of West Coast underground favorites The Renegadez.\n\nRampant misinformation about Eminem Presents: The Re-Up included many false\ninternet tracklistings and that the mixtape would be a tribute to D12&amp;#039;s Proof,\nthe recently slain rapper and close friend of Eminem. &quot;The D12 album and those\nunreleased songs with Proof are coming,&quot; said Eminem. &quot;But The Re-Up is about\nthese new artists and these new songs. It isn&amp;#039;t fair to them or to the memory of\nProof to mix them up.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54b36a34858a6a6b4a57f1cc9780e0292a3ccf3c","amp;dn":"Eminem+-+the+Re-up","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54b36a34858a6a6b4a57f1cc9780e0292a3ccf3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,179,106,52,133,138,106,107,74,87,241,204,151,128,224,41,42,60,207,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
