It can also be used as a reference book for \nresearchers in the area of design and analysis of approximation algorithms. Design and Analysis of Approximation Algorithms is a graduate course in \ntheoretical computer science taught widely in the universities, both in the United States and abroad. There are, however, very few textbooks available for \nthis course. Among those available in the market, most books follow a problem-oriented format; that is, they collected many important combinatorial \noptimization problems and their approximation algorithms, and organized them based on the types, or applications, of problems, such as geometric-type \nproblems, algebraic-type problems, etc. Such arrangement of materials is perhaps convenient for a researcher to look for the problems and algorithms \nrelated to his/her work, but is difficult for a student to capture the ideas underlying the various algorithms. In the new book proposed here, \nwe follow a more structured, technique-oriented presentation. We organize approximation algorithms into different chapters, based on the design \ntechniques for the algorithms, so that the reader can study approximation algorithms of the same nature together. It helps the reader to better understand \nthe design and analysis techniques for approximation algorithms, and also helps the teacher to present the ideas and techniques of approximation \nalgorithms in a more unified way.\n\nPLZ SEED AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdce93e64e18233ef8a05af9b9c2d20c9439b580","amp;dn":"Design+and+Analysis+of+Approximation+Algorithms%5BTeam+Nanban%5D%5BTPB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdce93e64e18233ef8a05af9b9c2d20c9439b580","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,206,147,230,78,24,35,62,248,160,90,249,185,194,210,12,148,57,181,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
