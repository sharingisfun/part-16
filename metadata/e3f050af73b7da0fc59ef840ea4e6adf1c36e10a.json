It is a special gift for two special persons. The list grew a bit long and kind of broke in two. Just like in real life.\n\nThey must know each other some interesting year now. By this special gift I can give them some deserved attention and share it with everybody at the same time.\nIs it L-o-v-e, I Wonder.\n\nListening to some jazz my thoughts went their way and.... in this way I can give them real Love and I Wonder. Romantic jazz music for two, I guess they both like (when they take some time (off))..... With special thanks to Jamal the Moroccan....
