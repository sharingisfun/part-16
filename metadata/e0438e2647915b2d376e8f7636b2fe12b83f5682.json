This illustrated history examines Pullman's diverse fleet, from its spectacular custom-built wooden cars of the nineteenth century to steel heavyweight cars in the prewar years and on into the lightweight streamlined era. Author Joe Welsh includes period photos, many in rare color, as well as car diagrams and ads that help trace the development, composition, and evolution of the historically and culturally significant Pullman fleet, including the gamut of sleeper, parlor, and restaurant cars. This is a fitting tribute to the former cultural icons aboard which strode giants of American life, such as Babe Ruth and Clark Gable, as well as first-time travelers from small-town America.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0438e2647915b2d376e8f7636b2fe12b83f5682","amp;dn":"The+Cars+of+Pullman+%28US+Railways+History%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0438e2647915b2d376e8f7636b2fe12b83f5682","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,67,142,38,71,145,91,45,55,110,143,118,54,178,254,18,184,63,86,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
