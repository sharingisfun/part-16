Building workflows in a declarative fashion, and hosting them as services, is a natural way for building business logic that is tiered away from running applications that subscribe to them, therefore providing flexibility for when business processes change.\n\nIn Pro WF 4.5, author Bayer White walks you, as the developer, through the steps and explains the concepts of declaratively modeling domain specific business processes that can be hosted and exposed as services, either on premise or as cloud services within Windows Azure.\n\n- Gives you a practical knowledge of WF 4.5, Windows Server and Azure AppFabric.\n- Builds a foundation for building workflows that can be exposed on-premise or in the cloud.\n- Shows how to use the tools available for managing workflow services.\n\nWhat youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn\n- Understand the changes introduced in Windows Workflow Foundation after WF 4.0\n- Build workflows by understanding what tools are available so they can be hosted as services\n- Discover what hosting options are available with AppFabric and how to determine which one to use\n- Understand how to install and configure Windows Server and Windows Azure AppFabric\n- Deploy workflows as services using Windows Server and Windows Azure AppFabric\n- Determine current health of running services by understanding what tools are available for monitoring\n\nWho this book is for\nPro WF 4.5 is for developers and architects interested in building healthy long-running services either on-premise or in the cloud.\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
