With issue #10, it changed its format to color, and title to The Hulk!, and ran another 17 issues before it folded in 1981. It was a rare attempt by Marvel to mix their superhero characters with the &quot;mature readers&quot; black-and-white magazine format.\n\nWith the change to color and the title to The Hulk!, the magazine became Marvel's attempt to cash in on the popularity of The Incredible Hulk TV series, starring Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, both of whom were prominently featured and interviewed over the course of the magazine's run, as was executive producer Kenneth Johnson.\n\nThe magazine featured fully painted covers by such artists as Ken Barr, Earl Norem, and Joe Jusko. One cover in particular, painted by Norem, is one of the most iconic promotional/poster images of the Hulk:[citation needed] a darkly-lit close-up of his face, gritting his teeth with his knuckles raised, done for The Hulk! #17.\n\nArtists such as Walter Simonson, John Buscema, Howard Chaykin, John Romita, Sr., John Romita, Jr. (doing some of his first professional work), Keith Pollard, Jim Starlin, Joe Jusko, Bill Sienkiewicz, Val Mayerik, Herb Trimpe, Roger Stern, Brent Anderson, and Gene Colan provided interior artwork; while writers such as Starlin, Doug Moench, Dennis O'Neil, and Archie Goodwin took on the scripting chores.\n\nThrough its run the magazine published backup features starring Ulysses Bloodstone (issues #1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ6, #8) Man-Thing (issue #7) and Shanna the She-Devil (issue #9). Moon Knight was featured in issues #11Ã¢â‚¬â€œ15, #17Ã¢â‚¬â€œ18, and #20, featuring some of Bill Sienkiewicz' early work, when his style was similar to that of Neal Adams.\n\nWith issue #24, the title returned to black-and-white, though it published the last Dominic Fortune backup story in full color. The magazine was retired with issue #27.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8ab11d6ec1f4a6746632e3f48ee3caaa4382b4b","amp;dn":"THE+RAMPAGING+HULK+01-27+%28Marvel+Magazine%29+%281977-1981%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8ab11d6ec1f4a6746632e3f48ee3caaa4382b4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,171,17,214,236,31,74,103,70,99,46,63,72,238,60,170,164,56,43,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
