Here, they turn their attention to the secular and sacred music of Renaissance Spain, with detailed arrangements such as were common at the time.\r\n\r\nBio of the group included.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can find all my classical uploads by searching on Philidor, or checking this thread:\r\n \nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Philidor-s-uploads--63895","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77a427dd580b56a640d14952d5e4602a78244d6c","amp;dn":"Spanish+Renaissance+Wind+Music+-+Piffaro+%281997%29+%5BPhilidor%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77a427dd580b56a640d14952d5e4602a78244d6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,164,39,221,88,11,86,166,64,209,73,82,213,228,96,42,120,36,77,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
