Much of this storyline focuses on Wolverine's loss of hos healing factor following AvX, and how he copes (or doesn't) with his new found mortality. This tale concludes with the controversial &quot;Killable&quot; arc, and follows with v6 in short fashion. This is a nice clean modern release - all copies of the main title are Digital by Nahga-Empire. I have also including two bonuses - Wolverine: An Origin Story hardcover which is like a storybook for kids telling them about his early beginnings (scan by Lusipher-DCP) and also the short, 8-page Marvel Digital Comics Exclusive - Wolverine: Agent of Atlas, which shows him fighting alongside that team in the past (digital webrip by PeteThePIPster). Thanks to all the groups for their quality efforts - please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34215fd639c68f95fcde00507f58eed8c07ca84a","amp;dn":"Wolverine+v5+01-13+%2B+Ex+%282013-2014%7CDigital%7CNahga-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34215fd639c68f95fcde00507f58eed8c07ca84a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,33,95,214,57,198,143,149,252,222,0,80,127,88,238,216,192,124,168,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
