These systems, ranging from active electronically-scanned radar arrays to web servers, require components that can dissipate heat efficiently. This requires materials capable of dissipating heat and maintaining compatibility with the packaging and dye. Coverage includes all aspects of thermal management materials, both traditional and non-traditional,with an emphasis on metal based materials. An in-depth discussion of properties and manufacturing processes, and current applications are provided. Also presented are a discussion of the importance of cost, performance and reliability issues when making implementation decisions, product life cycle developments, lessons learned and future directions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d1ac907fd37efd089ab6b0ad5ca7833cc5f9f3d","amp;dn":"Advanced+Thermal+Management+Materials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d1ac907fd37efd089ab6b0ad5ca7833cc5f9f3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,26,201,7,253,55,239,208,137,171,107,10,213,202,120,51,204,95,159,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
