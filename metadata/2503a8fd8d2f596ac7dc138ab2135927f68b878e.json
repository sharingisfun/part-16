This is an unusually raw and explicit drama in which all the scenes are shot in black and white except the opening sequence and the epilogue. \n\nPeter Egermann (Robert Atzorn), outwardly stable and well adjusted, suffers from depression, feelings of sexual inadequacy, and barey suppressed rage toward his wife, Katarina (Christine Buchegger). This eventually leads to the brutal rape and murder of a prostitute, known only as Ka, a nickname for Katarina. An intense and experimental film, whose complex structure allows us to explore the mind of a man driven to extremes, From the Life of the Marionettes is one of Bergman&amp;#039;s most daring works.\n\nFile Name .............: from_the_life_of_the_marionettes_bergman_1980.avi \nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 733,997,056 bytes \nRuntime (# of frames) .: 01:39:31 (149275 frames) \n\nVideo Codec ...........: XviD \nFrame Size ............: 656x496 () [=] [=1.323] \nFPS ...................: 25.000 \nVideo Bitrate .........: 850 kb/s \nBits per Pixel ........: 0.104 bpp \nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC ......: [B-VOP]...[N-VOP]...[]...[] \n\nAudio Codec ...........: 0x0055(MP3, ISO) MPEG-1 Layer 3 \nSample Rate ...........: 48000 Hz \nAudio bitrate .........: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR audio \nInterleave ............: 80 ms \nNo. of audio streams ..: 1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2503a8fd8d2f596ac7dc138ab2135927f68b878e","amp;dn":"Ingmar+Bergman+-+Aus+dem+Leben+der+Marionetten+%281980%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2503a8fd8d2f596ac7dc138ab2135927f68b878e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,3,168,253,141,47,89,106,199,220,19,138,178,19,89,39,246,139,135,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
