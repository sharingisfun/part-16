It includes model building, fitting to data, local and global analysis techniques. Various types of deterministic dynamical models are considered: ordinary differential equation models, delay-differential equation models, difference equation models, age-structured PDE models and diffusion models. It includes various techniques for the computation of the basic reproduction number as well as approaches to the epidemiological interpretation of the reproduction number. MATLAB code is included to facilitate the data fitting and the simulation with age-structured models","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9d45a8294e5ec3506c9603ac56aab7cc6a71e9e","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+Mathematical+Epidemiology+-+Maia+Martcheva","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9d45a8294e5ec3506c9603ac56aab7cc6a71e9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,212,90,130,148,229,236,53,6,201,96,58,197,106,171,124,198,167,30,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
