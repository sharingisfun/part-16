Y. with the Oscar Peterson Trio (1997)\n\nDefying what has become conventional wisdom, tenor saxophonist Lester Young cut some of his greatest recordings in the 1950s -- that is, when he was reasonably healthy. On this wonderful effort with pianist Oscar Peterson, guitarist Barney Kessel, bassist Ray Brown, and drummer J.C. Heard, Prez performs definitive versions of &quot;Just You, Just Me&quot; and &quot;Tea for Two,&quot; and plays a string of concise but memorable ballad renditions: &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street,&quot; &quot;Almost Like Being in Love,&quot; &quot;I Can't Give You Anything But Love,&quot; &quot;There Will Never Be Another You,&quot; and &quot;I'm Confessin'.&quot; This is essential music from a jazz legend. [Some reissues augment the original dozen songs with a version of the good-humored &quot;It Takes Two to Tango,&quot; which features Young's only recorded vocals, plus a rather unnecessary false start (on &quot;I Can't Get Started,&quot; ironically), along with some studio chatter.] (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Ad Lib Blues\n02 - I Can't Get Started\n03 - Just You, Just Me\n04 - Almost Like Being In Love\n05 - Tea For Two\n06 - There Will Never Be Another You\n07 - (Back Home Again In) Indiana\n08 - On The Sunny Side Of The Street\n09 - Star Dust\n10 - I'm Confessin'\n11 - I Can't Give You Anything But Love\n12 - These Foolish Things\n13 - (It Takes) Two To Tango\n14 - I Can't Get Started (false start)\n\nPersonnel:\nLester Young (vocals, tenor saxophone)\nOscar Peterson (piano)\nBarney Kessel (guitar)\nRay Brown (bass)\nJ.
