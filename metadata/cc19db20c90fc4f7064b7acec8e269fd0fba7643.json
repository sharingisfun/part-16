Created with help from many Airbus pilots and Air Berlin it is what Aerosoft believes an airliner in FSX should be. Directly aimed at the user who likes to fly and not to spend too much time on configuration and pre-flight checks but who does not want to compromise on the modelling and features, this aircraft will appeal to a large group of flight simmers. \n\nThe fully functional Virtual Cockpit puts the user in a fully immersive environment where detailed animations (all with sound effects) and a high level of detailed modelling show the level of details that separate FSX from FS2004.\n\n\nAll the displays are detailed and easy to read, even at lower resolutions and show how most A320/A321ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s are now leaving the factory. While leaving out the most complex (and least used) functions of the computer systems, the actual operation of the aircraft is highly accurate and as easy and logical as Airbus designs its aircraft. The displays will automatically show you the information you most need at any given moment.\n\nThe Fly-By-Wire flight model is totally reliable and extremely close to the actual aircraft. Where older aircraft use conventional throttles, the Airbus has a realistic FADEC system that means you almost never have to touch the throttle after you started your take-off run.\n\nThe external model is highly detailed and very smooth. All cabin and freight doors can be operated and show the interior of the aircraft. Animation of the flight control surfaces is accurate both in timing and movements.\n\nEnjoy, AND PLEASE SEED!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc19db20c90fc4f7064b7acec8e269fd0fba7643","amp;dn":"FSX+-+Aerosoft+Airbus+X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc19db20c90fc4f7064b7acec8e269fd0fba7643","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,25,219,32,201,15,196,247,6,75,122,206,200,226,105,253,15,186,118,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
