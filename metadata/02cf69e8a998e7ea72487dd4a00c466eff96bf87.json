There, he has been for years quietly tending the corpse of an unknown stranger that mysteriously turned up in his rain-filled spray pit. Ather also attempts to teach his knowledge about the mountains and forests to young John Wesley Rattner, a mountain boy whose father, the petty criminal and con man Kenneth Ratner, has been murdered by Marion Sylder, a local bootlegger. John Wesley, who believes his father was a hero, is unaware that his uncle Ownby has been guarding the corpse, and Ather himself has no idea whose body he has been honoring. The storyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ironies grow more complex when Sylder defends the boy against his own nemesis, the bullying sheriffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deputy Legwater, and John Wesley comes to regard the dashing Sylder as his hero; the bootlegger, in turn, has no idea that the man he had murdered and dumped in the spray pit was John WesleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02cf69e8a998e7ea72487dd4a00c466eff96bf87","amp;dn":"Cormac+McCarthy-The+Orchard+Keeper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02cf69e8a998e7ea72487dd4a00c466eff96bf87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,207,105,232,169,152,231,234,114,72,125,212,160,12,70,110,255,150,191,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
