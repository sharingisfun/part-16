The film did not see the light of a carbon arc in America until 1980.\n\nFilms are predominantly made for entertainment. However some, such as the Russian movie The Orphans - thanks to its intelligently composed narrative - lead its viewers to powerful conclusions about life. The main protagonist is a writer who is trying hard to make sense of the childhood experiences that crafted his personality. He remembers the times when he was a little boy, when he and his sister had to steal food in order to survive. World War II had just ended, leaving them as orphans.\n\n\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 720x556, 25.000 fps, 2170 Kbps, 01h28m10s\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, mono, 192 kbps\n\nRussian audio, optional subtitles in English, French\n\ncover: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/acbxurtw7/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/acbxurtw7/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nscreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/yesrpnajb/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/yesrpnajb/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/6tzxydt07/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/6tzxydt07/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/fqaq2bjmf/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/fqaq2bjmf/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/svq88fdhz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/svq88fdhz/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:621743c8729b330813e75feee9c9298efde721b0","amp;dn":"Podranki+-+The+Orphans+%281977+-+Soviet+Union+-+%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B8%29+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"621743c8729b330813e75feee9c9298efde721b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,23,67,200,114,155,51,8,19,231,95,238,233,201,41,142,253,231,33,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
