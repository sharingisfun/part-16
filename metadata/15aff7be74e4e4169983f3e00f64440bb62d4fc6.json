Based upon a play, &quot;The Front Page&quot; (1928) by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur.\n\nCast: Starring Kathleen Turner, Burt Reynolds, and Christopher Reeve. Supporting turns by George Newbern, Henry Gibson, Fiona Reid, Ned Beatty, and Charles Kimbrough.\n\nCrew: Ted Kotcheff directs, with cinematographer Francois Protat. Production design by Anne Pritchard. Edited by Thom Noble. Music by Michel Legrande. Produced by Martin Ransohoff.\n\nIMDb: http://www.imdb.org/title/tt0096203/\n\nEveryone in this movie has a good line or a shining moment. Many familiar faces and characters. Christopher Reeve's performance is memorable.\n\nThe movie reflects some interesting signs its time. Of particular note are the idle activities of the reporters around the press room, perhaps playing off the film's title (screenshot &quot;J&quot;).\n\nFor Final Fantasy VII fans, a regular voice actor for Sephiroth has a prominent supporting role (screenshot &quot;K&quot;). Newbern, who shares a remarkable sequence with Reeve (screenshot &quot;F&quot;), has voiced Superman as well.\n\n--- About the DVD rip\n\nQuality:   Very good, even excellent. Clear A/V, no smudginess or pixelation.\nAudio:     English\nSubtitles: Russian (both v1 and v2 SRT files included); *NOT* hard-coded\n\nComplete name                   : Switching Channels (1988).avi\nFile size                       : 1.37 GB (1,432 MB)\nDuration                        : 1h 40mn (01:40:26)\nWidth                           : 672 pixels\nHeight                          : 368 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio            : 16:9 (1.85:1)\nFrame rate                      : 25.000 fps\nFormat                          : AVI\nCodec                           : XviD\nMPAA Rating                     : PG\n\nDisclaimer: These files are provided as-is to promote try-before-you-buy exposure to an often overlooked film.
