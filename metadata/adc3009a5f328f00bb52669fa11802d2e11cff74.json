You can use flexible planning tools - such as the planning of the work, the taskbar and backlog management - to introduce techniques for the coherent development and application of Agile methodologies in your own pace. Use advanced tools for modeling, detection, and architecture design to describe their system and ensure full implementation of your concept of architecture. Achieve interaction between teams of developers and operators with tools such as IntelliTrace in production environments, Operations Manager Connector and Preemptive Analytics. Enhance the quality and reduces the time to repair by creating a full-scale error of software, including a specific list of activities, and interaction with operators to obtain data that will allow developers to more detailed analysis of production problems. \r\n\r\nVersion: 2012 Build 11.0.50727.1 RTM \r\nBit depth: 32bit +64 bit \r\nCompatibility with Vista: No \r\nCompatible with Windows 7: complete \r\nLanguage: English \r\n\r\nSystem requirements: \r\nOperating Systems: \r\nWindows 7 (x86 and x64) \r\nWindows 8 (x86 and x64) \r\nWindows Server 2008 R2 (x64) \r\nWindows Server 2012 (x64) \r\nSupported architectures: \r\n32-bit (x86) (Windows 7 client and Windows 8) \r\n64-bit (x64) \r\nHardware Requirements: \r\nProcessor with a clock speed of 1.6 GHz or higher \r\n1 GB RAM (1.5 GB for the virtual machine) \r\n10 GB of available hard disk space \r\nHard disk drive with a speed of 5400 r / min \r\nVideo card, DirectX 9-compliant and supports a resolution of 1024 x 768 or higher","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adc3009a5f328f00bb52669fa11802d2e11cff74","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Visual+Studio+Ultimate+product+key","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adc3009a5f328f00bb52669fa11802d2e11cff74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,195,0,154,95,50,143,0,187,82,102,159,161,24,2,210,225,28,255,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
