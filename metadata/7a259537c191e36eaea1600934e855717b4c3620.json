Picking up immediately after Robin's Wild Ride (there was no wild ride) we're thrown right back into the action when Batman gets trapped in Batman Trapped! Okay he doesn't really get trapped, per se, but we do get to see the Caped Crusader climb a gentle incline with great difficulty! And it takes a while! He seems pretty tired!\n\nThe mysterious Wizard and his squad of gangsters (except for Gabe, who spends this episode offscreen picking up Gatorades for the gangsters' weekly pickup basketball game, he's such a thoughtful guy) are still at it, kidnapping various scientist types and stealing various science-type things. What's their endgame? Nobody's quite sure, including the World's Greatest Detective and the people who wrote this serial!\n\nGet Trapped with Mike, Kevin, and Bill!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a259537c191e36eaea1600934e855717b4c3620","amp;dn":"RiffTrax+-+Batman+-+Trapped+%28mpg%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a259537c191e36eaea1600934e855717b4c3620","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,37,149,55,193,145,227,110,174,161,96,9,52,232,85,113,123,76,54,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
