Drawing on the latest research from anthropology to neuroscience and her own field experience, she argues that the biggest challenge to human survival isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t our fossil fuel dependency, melting glaciers, or other calamities. Rather, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s our faulty way of thinking about these environmental crises that robs us of power. LappÃƒÂ© dismantles seven common Ã¢â‚¬Å“thought trapsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€from limits to growth to the failings of democracyÃ¢â‚¬â€ that belie what we now know about nature, including our own, and offers contrasting Ã¢â‚¬Å“thought leapsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that reveal our hidden power.\nLike her Diet for a Small Planet classic, EcoMind is challenging, controversial and empowering.
