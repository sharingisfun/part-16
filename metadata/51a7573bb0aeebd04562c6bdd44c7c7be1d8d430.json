Smith becomes Huey Newton: the chain smoking hyper active monologue master. He also shows that Newton was not just some slogan spitting radical: he was funny as hell. And when he spoke of revolution, it was with brilliance, passion and clarity. But never was it boring. He could have you in hysterics and furious indignation at the same time. Smith&amp;#039;s performance is mesmerizing. It is also woefully under rated. He brings to life a portrayal of Huey not as a martyr or a joke. He shows Huey as a real human being with real weaknesses. A genius junkie who at one point had much of white America in fear because Huey (and the Panthers) represented the antithesis of the MLK approach. To Huey, if they shoot at you, you shoot right back, because dignity means standing up for what you believe, and human rights are inalienable rights to protect or attain by any means necessary.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278490/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278490/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51a7573bb0aeebd04562c6bdd44c7c7be1d8d430","amp;dn":"A+Huey+P+Newton+Story","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51a7573bb0aeebd04562c6bdd44c7c7be1d8d430","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,167,87,59,176,174,235,208,69,98,198,189,212,76,124,123,225,216,212,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
