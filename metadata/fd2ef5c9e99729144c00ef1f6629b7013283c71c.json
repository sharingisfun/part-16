Travel back in time to understand the motivations behind early solutions and inventions. We learn that much of the science and technology we consider to be &quot;modern&quot; was created by civilisations long ago.. DVD Release Date: 14 May 2012\n\n\n3)  Egypt \nMore than 5,000 years ago, faith moved mountains--virtually. Observations must have led the ancient Egyptians to believe that the cycles of life were governed by a rule whereby each phenomenon they detected had a counterpart. Life, they concluded, must have an afterlife as its opposite. And to enjoy the afterlife, you needed a body, one that was your own in this life and one that would remain intact. Achieving this goal propelled discoveries and innovations in technology and science. The program traces the scale and effects of ancient Egyptian faith by closely examining the rise and fall of pyramid construction. Viewers will discover how life in ancient Egypt was consumed with the preparation for the afterlife. As the desire and financial ability of Egyptians seeking the afterlife increased, a highly specialized and diversified workforce grew. This helped promote an intricate industry and infrastructure of organization, supply lines, and administration.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/1792/whattheancientsknewthew.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/1792/whattheancientsknewthew.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img255.imageshack.us/img255/1792/whattheancientsknewthew.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img255.imageshack.us/img255/1792/whattheancientsknewthew.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/1792/whattheancientsknewthew.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/1792/whattheancientsknewthew.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/1792/whattheancientsknewthew.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/1792/whattheancientsknewthew.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/1792/whattheancientsknewthew.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/1792/whattheancientsknewthew.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img706.imageshack.us/img706/1792/whattheancientsknewthew.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img706.imageshack.us/img706/1792/whattheancientsknewthew.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/1792/whattheancientsknewthew.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/1792/whattheancientsknewthew.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/983/whattheancientsknewthewa.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/983/whattheancientsknewthewa.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img211.imageshack.us/img211/6378/whattheancientsknewthewu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img211.imageshack.us/img211/6378/whattheancientsknewthewu.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1845 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 50mins\n * Number Of Parts: 3\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://science.discovery.com/tv-shows/what-the-ancients-knew/videos/what-the-ancients-knew-about-romes-beginning.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://science.discovery.com/tv-shows/what-the-ancients-knew/videos/what-the-ancients-knew-about-romes-beginning.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd2ef5c9e99729144c00ef1f6629b7013283c71c","amp;dn":"Discovery+Ch+What+the+Ancients+Knew+The+West+3of3+Egypt+DVDrip+X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd2ef5c9e99729144c00ef1f6629b7013283c71c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,46,245,201,233,151,41,20,76,0,239,31,102,41,183,1,50,131,199,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
