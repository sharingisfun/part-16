He lost his wife, his son, and his freedom. This is the story of how Michael Morton finally got justiceÃ¢â‚¬â€and a second chance at life.\nOn August 13, 1986, just one day after his thirty-second birthday, Michael Morton went to work at his usual time. By the end of the day, his wife Christine had been savagely bludgeoned to death in the couple's bedÃ¢â‚¬â€and the Williamson County Sherriff's office in Texas wasted no time in pinning her murder on Michael, despite an absolute lack of physical evidence. Michael was swiftly sentenced to life in prison for a crime he had not committed.\n\nHe mourned his wife from a prison cell. He lost all contact with their son. Life, as he knew it, was over.\n\nIt would take twenty-five yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€and thousands of hours of effort on the part of Michael's lawyers, including the team at the New York-based Innocence ProjectÃ¢â‚¬â€before DNA evidence was..was brought to light that would ultimately set Michael free. The evidence had been collected only days after the murder; but was never investigated.Drawing on his recollections, court transcripts, and more than one thousand pages of personal journals he wrote in prison, Michael recounts the hidden police reports about an unidentified van parked near his house that were never pursued; the treasure trove of evidence, including a bandana with the killer&amp;s DNA on it, that was never introduced in court; the call from a neighboring county reporting the attempted use of his wife'scredit card (a message that was received, recorded, and never returned by local police); and ultimately, how he battled his way through the darkness to become a free man once again.\n\nGetting Life is an extraordinary story of unfathomable tragedy, grave injustice, and the strength and courage it takes to find forgiveness.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19302626-getting-life&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19302626-getting-life&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b95a9a57518ad39f81fb3b75162b352b6248658d","amp;dn":"Getting+Life+-+Michael+Morton+%28epub%2C+mobi%2C+pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b95a9a57518ad39f81fb3b75162b352b6248658d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,90,154,87,81,138,211,159,129,251,59,117,22,43,53,43,98,72,101,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
