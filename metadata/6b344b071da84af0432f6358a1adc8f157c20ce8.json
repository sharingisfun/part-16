In his new book, bestselling author Dinesh D'Souza takes on the leading critics of Christianity, from E. O. Wilson to Richard Dawkins. D'Souza shows that, against all expectations, Christianity is the fastest-growing religion in the world and that secularism and atheism are on the decline. This, D'Souza contends, explains the panicky efforts by atheists to discredit Christianity, exclude it from the public sphere, and indoctrinate schoolchildren in atheist doctrine masquerading as science.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b344b071da84af0432f6358a1adc8f157c20ce8","amp;dn":"What%5C%27s+So+Great+About+Christianity%3F+-+Dinesh+D%5C%27Souza","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b344b071da84af0432f6358a1adc8f157c20ce8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,52,75,7,29,168,74,240,67,47,99,88,161,173,200,241,87,194,12,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
