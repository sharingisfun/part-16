It's not much different than the debut, either, and can't fail to remind seasoned British folk-rock listeners of a more normal Incredible String Band, though the connection's legitimate since C.O.B.'s Clive Palmer was a founding member of the ISB. There's a plaintive, almost hymn-like feel to this muted British folk-rock, which is much folkier than rocky. There's also a tinge of acid-folk in the use of some relatively exotic instrumentation for a folk-rock record, including balalaika, dulcitar, tabla, banjo, and harmonium-like organ. &quot;Eleven Willows&quot; gets a little closer to Pentangle-Bert Jansch territory, and Genevieve Baker's nicely haunting background singing on that track makes one wish she'd been given a more prominent role in the band's vocals, which are merely adequate, on the whole. The 1999 CD reissue on Lotus adds two bonus tracks from a non-LP 1972 single, &quot;Blue Morning&quot; and &quot;Bones,&quot; which are more rock-oriented than the songs on the album, particularly the reggae-fied &quot;Blue Morning.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89d08376397bc41149202a7eb5ad324b8d2bad70","amp;dn":"C.O.B.+-+Moyshe+McStiff+and+the+Tartan+Lancers+of+the+Sacred+Hea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89d08376397bc41149202a7eb5ad324b8d2bad70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,208,131,118,57,123,196,17,73,32,42,126,181,173,50,75,141,43,173,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
