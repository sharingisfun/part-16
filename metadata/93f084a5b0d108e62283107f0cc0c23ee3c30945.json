He has no memories, no identity, and no pulse, but he has dreams. His ability to connect with the outside world is limited to a few grunted syllables, but his inner life is deep, full of wonder and longing. After experiencing a teenage boy's memories while consuming his brain, R makes an unexpected choice that begins a tense, awkward, and strangely sweet relationship with the victim's human girlfriend, Julie.\r\n\r\nJulie is a blast of color in the otherwise dreary and gray landscape that surrounds R. His choice to protect her will transform not only R but his fellow Dead and perhaps their whole lifeless world. Scary, funny, and surprisingly poignant, Warm Bodies explores what happens when the cold heart of a zombie is tempted by the warmth of human love","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93f084a5b0d108e62283107f0cc0c23ee3c30945","amp;dn":"Isaac+Marion-Warm+Bodies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93f084a5b0d108e62283107f0cc0c23ee3c30945","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,240,132,165,176,209,8,230,34,131,16,127,12,192,194,62,227,195,9,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
