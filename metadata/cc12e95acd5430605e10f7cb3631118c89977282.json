There are so many signal integrity tools available for design, analysis, and troubleshooting of high-speed inter connects itÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s difficult to manage them all. AgilentÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s PLTS design team has created version 2014, integrating new features into PLTS\nfor a substantial boost in productivity.\n\nPLTS is the signal integrity industry solution for measurement and analysis of physical layer devices. Wizards help users to calibrate and measure multiport devices with ease. Once measured, PLTS has a rich set of displays, analysis, data reformatting and conversion tools, as well as a versatile set of import and export capabilities. PLTS works with PNA and ENA network analyzers, and TDRs. Data and transmission line models can be exported to, or imported from simulation tools. The analysis features include single-ended and differential plots in frequency or time, as well as eye diagrams and RCLG model extraction.\n\nMajor tool advancements:\n\nMany usability features have been incorporated into PLTS 2014, but there are two new capabilities that are considered breakthrough for the technical industry. The first is multi-channel simulation and the other is 1-port automatic fixture removal\n(AFR). Together they create a time saving tool that helps the experienced user accomplish more advanced analysis of the physical layer channel. The multi-channel simulation capability allows the user to quickly measure a channel, remove any fixtures and then simulate the measured channelsÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ performance. The newly added capability to use vendor supplied IBIS-AMI models for TX and RX creates real-world simulation results.\n\nBuilt-in TX sources can be customized to match a specified signal. Users can specify data rates, lengths and voltages and then add noise, jitter, and re-emphasis. The built-in customizable RX allows the user to select from the common CTLE, FFE, and DFE equalizers. Multiple sources can be added to simulate aggressor cross talk for multi-channel simulations. The resulting waveforms can be displayed in multi-color eye diagrams with histograms for common eye measurements.\n\nThe 1-port automatic fixture removal tool is a breakthrough extension of the 2X THRU AFR that saves the user from designing and fabricating special calibration structures on PCBs. Now, the test fixture itself can be used as the ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£1X THRUÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ structure with an open circuit on port 2. This is extremely helpful when working\nwith FPGA applications where it is nearly impossible to create a normal 2X THRU structure. Furthermore, the accuracy can be enhanced by using additional calibration structures together such as an open, short and/or THRU. This error correction flexibility gives the signal integrity engineer more control over accuracy versus ease-of-use decisions that need to be made for leading edge applications.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc12e95acd5430605e10f7cb3631118c89977282","amp;dn":"Agilent+Physical+Layer+Test+System+%28PLTS%29+2014++%5BRe-Upload%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc12e95acd5430605e10f7cb3631118c89977282","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,18,233,90,205,84,48,96,94,16,247,203,54,49,17,140,137,151,114,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
