This week it's another double dose, we have Change of Luck (Ace on the River RemiXXX) and Enjoy the Silence (From Beave to Eternity RemiXXX). I have some outtakes of more studio stuff next week when we start the Relapse remiXXX album. If you've been loving the remiXXXes, you're not going to be disappointed in the next set.\n\n Ministry: The Lost Gospels of Al Jourgensen, it's being released on paperback and you can order it here,It comes out Sept 2nd...\n\nEnjoy, share and make all your posts on our Facebook, Twitter and website (www.alfuckingjourgensen.com). Some of you are just leeching...do you job too. Get the word out on these FREE downloads. We did our job of slaving over these remixxxes, so you help get the word out to your cult. Fair enough?\n\nSo, remember: 1. like my Alien Jourgensen and Ministry fan pages on Facebook AND hit up my Twitter @alfknjourgensen. 2. Send a link back to us from your website, social media or online magazines.\n\nHow easy was that...a new track gets released THIS Monday (along with some extras on the Pirate Bay... yes...THAT Pirate Bay) and will be released in the same order as on the album. If that weren't enough...we're gonna do the same with the Relapse remixxxes after From Beer to Eternity's are all done... so download away..\n\n-Uncle Al\nwww.alfuckingjourgensen.com\n\nIncludes:\n\nLesson Unlearned (shake your space cakes RemiXXX)\nGospels Outtake (The Ostrich Story)\n\n\n\nthepiratebay.org\n\nMinistry Monday #1 - http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10548971/Ministry_Monday__1\nMinistry Monday #2 - http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10599882/Ministry_Monday__2\nMinistry Monday #3 - http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10647380\nMinistry Monday #4 - http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10700804\n\nMinistry Monday #5 - http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10739169\n\nMinistry Monday #6 - http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10801241\n\nMinistry Monday #7 - http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10868923\n\nMinistry Monday #8 - http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10942604","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b780196532e35ec629f200babf59f9f73b668700","amp;dn":"Ministry+Monday+%239","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b780196532e35ec629f200babf59f9f73b668700","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,128,25,101,50,227,94,198,41,242,0,186,191,89,249,247,59,102,135,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
