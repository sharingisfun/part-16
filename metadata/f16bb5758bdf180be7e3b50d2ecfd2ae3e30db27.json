Peter Asher was the older brother of Jane Asher, Paul McCartney's girlfriend for much of the 1960s. This no doubt gave Asher and Gordon Waller access to Lennon-McCartney compositions that were unrecorded by the Beatles, such as &quot;A World Without Love&quot; and three of their other biggest hits, &quot;Nobody I Know,&quot; &quot;I Don't Want to See You Again,&quot; and &quot;Woman&quot; (the last of which was written by McCartney under a pseudonym). But Peter &amp; Gordon were significant talents in their own right, a sort of Everly Brothers-styled duo for the British Invasion that faintly prefigured the folk-rock of the mid-'60s. In fact, when Gene Clark first approached Jim McGuinn in 1964 about working together in a group that would eventually evolve into the Byrds, he suggested that they could form a Peter &amp; Gordon-styled act.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/peter-gordon-p5136/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/peter-gordon-p5136/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
