Furthermore, these texts furnish little, if any, source code and leave many of the more difficult aspects of the implementation as exercises. A fresh alternative to conventional data structures and algorithms books, A Practical Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms using Java presents comprehensive coverage of fundamental data structures and algorithms in a unifying framework with full implementation details. Recognizing that software development is a top-down process, this applications-centered book provides careful guidance to students and practitioners.
