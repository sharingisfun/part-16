The song was produced by Nasri Atweh and Adam Messinger of The Messengers, who wrote the song with Brown and Amber Streeter of American R&amp;B girl group RichGirl. Brown first revealed plans to collaborate with Bieber in December 2010, and the track is the first of two tracks they worked together on, the second being a remix of Bieber's &quot;Up.&quot; Musically, &quot;Next 2 You&quot; is a R&amp;B and pop number, with lyrics pertaining to the love between two in a relationship. Most music critics positively reviewed the song, complimenting the blending of Brown and Bieber's vocals. However a common criticism of the track was how it stood out in comparison into the more lyrically explicit music on F.A.M.E.. After the release of the album, the song appeared on the charts in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03be0751f2f583a660aa32b0878adf494dcf9dab","amp;dn":"Chris+Brown+featuring+Justin+Bieber+-+Next+2+You+%5BMp3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03be0751f2f583a660aa32b0878adf494dcf9dab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,190,7,81,242,245,131,166,96,170,50,176,135,138,223,73,77,207,157,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
