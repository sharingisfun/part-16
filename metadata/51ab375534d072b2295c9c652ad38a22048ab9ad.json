Ã¢â‚¬Å“Understand?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nBorn in 1975 in the UK to a Pakistani father and an English mother, Alexander Khan spent his early years as a Muslim in the north of England. But at the age of three his family was torn apart when his father took him to Pakistan. Despite his desperate cries, that was the last he saw of his mother Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he was told she had walked out and abandoned them; many years later he learned she was told heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d died in a car crash in Pakistan.\n\nThree years on Alex is brought back to England, but kept hidden at all times. His father disappears to Pakistan again, leaving Alex in the care of a stepmother and her cruel brother. And it is then that his troubles really begin. Seen as an outsider by both the white kids and the Pakistani kids, Alex is lost and alone.\n\nWhen his father dies unexpectedly, Alex is sent back to Pakistan to stay with his Ã¢â‚¬ËœfamilyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and learn to behave like a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœgood MuslimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Now alone in a strange, hostile country, with nobody to protect him, Alex realises what it is to be truly orphaned. No one would listen. No one would help. And no one cared when he was kidnapped by men from his own family and sent to a fundamentalist Madrassa on the Afghanistan border.\n\nA fascinating and compelling account of young boy caught between two cultures, this book tells the true story of a child desperately searching for his place in the world; the tale of a boy, lost and alone, trying to find a way to repair a life shattered by the shocking event he witnessed through a crack in the door of a house in an isolated village in Pakistan.\n\nGenre: Memoirs, Biography","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51ab375534d072b2295c9c652ad38a22048ab9ad","amp;dn":"Orphan+of+Islam+-+Khan%2C+Alexander.azw3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51ab375534d072b2295c9c652ad38a22048ab9ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,171,55,85,52,208,114,178,41,92,156,101,42,211,138,34,4,138,185,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
