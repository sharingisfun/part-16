Riots of complementary colors, masses of grasses, foliage spectacles in extraordinary shades of green and purple, and height variations as arresting as city skylines are all featured in these exciting gardens, each one an intimate glimpse of a larger garden. A favorite pairing can be the beginning of a larger garden design, or a five-plant grouping might be all you need to fill a small urban garden. The possibilities are as varied as your imagination!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:313f69b86b08fd7516c7370630e432f27debd568","amp;dn":"Designer+Plant+Combinations%3A+105++Gardens+Using+Six+Plants+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"313f69b86b08fd7516c7370630e432f27debd568","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,63,105,184,107,8,253,117,22,199,55,6,48,228,50,242,125,235,213,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
