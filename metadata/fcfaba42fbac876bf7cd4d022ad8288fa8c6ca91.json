These songs are pure melody supported by arrangements so sparse that they're sometimes barely there. Its quietest moments are aching (the sexy scoops of moonlight, &quot;Affection&quot; and &quot;I Hear You Calling Me&quot;) and its liveliest moments are danceable while powered by little more than an acoustic guitar and lightly knocking percussion (&quot;Party in the Woods Tonight&quot;, which is just about the same tune as the old rockabilly hit &quot;Let's Have a Party&quot;, recorded most famously by Wanda Jackson). All together it's weirdly haunting. It's so simple on the surface, but eccentric enough that you could spend all night with it.
