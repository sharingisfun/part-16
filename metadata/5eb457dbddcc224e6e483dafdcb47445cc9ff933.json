Track information and cover art may not be available for all of them.\n\nTo prevent the problems with tag corruption that plagued my last attempt to share this fine old music with you, I have wrapped each torrent into a single .rar file. I will be seeding five of them, so be sure to amaze your friends and collect them all.  :D\n\nThis torrent includes:\n\nCamino de Santiago (Ensemble Fur Fruhe Musik Augsburg)\nEt in terra pax (Ensemble Fur Fruhe Musik Augsburg)\nHildegard von Bingen und ihre Zeit (Ensemble Fur Fruhe Musik Augsburg)\nLet The Dance Begin (Instampitta)\nSongs of Chivalry (Martin Best Medieval Ensemble)\n\nAll are high quality rips at 320 kB or better! Enjoy -- and keep seeding!\n\n-- Rivenshield","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5eb457dbddcc224e6e483dafdcb47445cc9ff933","amp;dn":"Music+of+the+Middle+Ages+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5eb457dbddcc224e6e483dafdcb47445cc9ff933","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,180,87,219,221,204,34,78,110,72,61,175,220,180,116,69,204,159,249,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
