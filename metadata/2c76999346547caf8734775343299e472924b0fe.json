He hit number one in the U.K. in November 1968 with his version of the Beatles' &quot;A Little Help from My Friends.&quot; His career really took off after he sang that song at the Woodstock festival in August 1969. A second British hit came with a version of Leon Russell's &quot;Delta Lady&quot; in the fall of 1969 (by then, Russell was Cocker's musical director) and both of his albums, With a Little Help from My Friends (April 1969) and Joe Cocker! (November 1969), went gold in America. In 1970, his cover of the Box Tops hit &quot;The Letter&quot; became his first U.S. Top Ten.\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tA&amp;M\nCatalog:\t\tBOO15328-12\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.95% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.First We Take Manhattan\n02.Hard Knocks\n03.Unchain My Heart (90's Version)\n04.You Haven't Done Nothin'\n05.Unforgiven\n06.Chain Of Fools\n07.My Father's Son\n08.Don't Give Up On Me\n09.I Who Have Nothing\n10.Now That The Magic Has Gone\n11.Don't You Love Me Anymore\n12.I Keep Forgetting\n13.I Put A Spell On You\n14.Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word\n15.Hymn 4 My Soul\n16.Naked Without You\nGuy\n18.Night Calls\n19.On My Way Home\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c76999346547caf8734775343299e472924b0fe","amp;dn":"Joe+Cocker+-+The+Very+Best+Of++%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c76999346547caf8734775343299e472924b0fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,118,153,147,70,84,124,175,135,52,119,83,67,41,158,71,41,36,176,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
