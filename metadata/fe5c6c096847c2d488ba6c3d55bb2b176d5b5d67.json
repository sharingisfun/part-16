The television series was based on the original cartoon of the same name, with Jim Backus reprising the voice over of the role he did on TV: while doing this show, he continued with the nighttime show Gilligan's Island.\n\nUnlike the theatrical cartoons, which focused on the extremely nearsighted Quincy Magoo's bumbling, the show featured the Magoo character as an actor in adaptations of such literary classics as Don Quixote and Gunga Din. Each of these roles was played seriously, with few if any references to Magoo's nearsightedness; however, introductory segments in each program featured Magoo backstage stumbling into scenery and talking to props, thus connecting the older cartoons to this series. Some stories were contained in a single half-hour episode, but others ran to two and even four episodes.\n\nThe series was inspired by the success of the 1962 television special, Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol, a serious remake of the Charles Dickens classic with Magoo playing Ebenezer Scrooge.\n\nEpisode 1: Mr. Magoo's William Tell\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½19 September 1964\n\nEpisode 2: Mr. Magoo's Treasure Island: Part 1 Part 2\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½26 September 1964 3 October 1964\n \nEpisode 4: Mr. Magoo's Gunga Din\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½10 October 1964\n \nEpisode 5: Mr. Magoo's Moby Dick\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½17 October 1964\n \nEpisode 6: Mr. Magoo's The Three Musketeers: Part 1 Part 2\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½24 October 1964 7 November 1964\n \nEpisode 12: Mr. Magoo's Don Quixote de la Mancha: Part 1 Part 2\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½19 December 1964 20 March 1965 \n\nEpisode 13: Mr. Magoo's Cyrano de Bergerac\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½26 December 1964\n\nEpisode 14: Mr. Magoo's Little Snow White: Part 1 Part 2\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½2 January 1965 9 January 1965\n \nEpisode 16: Mr. Magoo's Rip Van Winkle\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½16 January 1965\n \nEpisode 18: Mr. Magoo's A Midsummer Night's Dream\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½13 February 1965\n \nEpisode 22: Mr. Magoo's Captain Kidd\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½27 March 1965\n \nEpisode 23: Mr. Magoo's Noah's Ark\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½3 April 1965\n\nEpisode 25: Mr. Magoo's King Arthur\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½17 April 1965\n\nEpisode 26: Mr. Magoo's Paul Revere\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½24 April 1965\n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe5c6c096847c2d488ba6c3d55bb2b176d5b5d67","amp;dn":"The+Famous+Adventures+of+Mr+Magoo+%28VHS%29+%28TV%29+%5B1964%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe5c6c096847c2d488ba6c3d55bb2b176d5b5d67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,92,108,9,104,71,194,212,136,186,108,61,85,187,43,23,109,91,93,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
