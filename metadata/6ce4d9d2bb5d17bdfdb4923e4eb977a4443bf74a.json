Harden was one of the first trumpeters in Jazz to regularly double on flugelhorn. On this session they are joined by Curtis Fuller on Trombone.\n \nWilbur Harden is a mystery man in jazz history, for he appeared on some important recording sessions - most notably with John Coltrane in 1958 on Ã¢â‚¬Å“StardustÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Standard ColtraneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“BahiaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ - and then, after 1960, pretty well disappeared. \n\nAfter playing R&amp;B with Roy Brown and Ivory Joe Hunter, Harden emerged in 1957, recording with Yusef Lateef, and led four record dates for Savoy in 1958; three were with Coltrane Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mainstream 1958Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jazz Way OutÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tanganyika StrutÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ - and one, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The King and IÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, in a quartet with Tommy Flanagan.\n\nIn late 1958 Harden fell seriously ill, spending four whole years under medical care. His last recording session took place in 1960 with Curtis Fuller's group, following a brief release from the hospital. After that, he quit playing and died in 1969 in New York.\n\n\n\nWilbur Harden with John Coltrane \n\nJazz Way Out\n\n[Savoy MG 12131]\n\n1958\n\n\n   CD / 1991 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nDial Africa\n\nOomba\n\nGold Coast\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\nWilbur Harden Ã¢â‚¬â€ trumpet / flugelhorn\n\nJohn Coltrane Ã¢â‚¬â€ tenor saxophone\n\nCurtis Fuller Ã¢â‚¬â€ trombone\n\nTommy Flanagan Ã¢â‚¬â€ piano\n\nAli Jackson Ã¢â‚¬â€ bass\n\nArt Taylor Ã¢â‚¬â€ drums\n\n\nWilbur Harden with John Coltrane \nJazz Way Out\n[Savoy MG 12131]\n1958","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ce4d9d2bb5d17bdfdb4923e4eb977a4443bf74a","amp;dn":"Wilbur+Harden+%2F+John+Coltrane+-+Jazz+Way+Out+1958+%5BSavoy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ce4d9d2bb5d17bdfdb4923e4eb977a4443bf74a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,228,217,210,187,93,23,189,253,180,146,62,78,185,119,164,68,59,247,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
