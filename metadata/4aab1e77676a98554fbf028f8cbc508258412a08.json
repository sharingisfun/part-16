But Lowe's determination to quit medicine is challenged when he meets a committed British nurse who runs a free clinic in Calcutta's most dangerous neighborhood. And when her clinic - and the livelihood of her neighbors - is threatened by the brutal local &quot;godfather,&quot; Max teaches the impoverished Indians the strength of their own unity. Beautifully filmed by the director of The Killing Fields and The Mission, City of Joy is &quot;a masterpiece and a triumph! The Best Picture of the year.&quot; (Jim Whaley, Cinema Showcase)\n\n\nWriters:\n Mark Medoff\n\nProducers:\n Roland Joffe\n Jake Eberts\n\nDirectors:\n Roland Joffe\n\nCast:\n Patrick Swayze as Max Lowe\n Om Puri as Hasari Pal\n Shabana Azmi as Kamla H.
