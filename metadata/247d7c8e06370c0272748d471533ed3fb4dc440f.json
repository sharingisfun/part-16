Six songs have never appeared on any bootlegs of this show before. The show is charged and U2 is in great form. The bootleg comes with black cover art and photos from both 1982 and (strangely enough) 1992. The Boston date incorrectly labeled as May 29, 1983. A nice addition to any collection, especially since it covers the entire show. The Hilversum recording appears on other bootlegs. Both shows were recorded for radio broadcast, but I believe the master tape from the Boston show was used to master this CD. You should definitely pick this up. This is probably the best recorded representation of a U2 show from the 1983 tour. The only flaw in the Boston show is a 2-second &quot;skip&quot; (quite like a record would do) during the piano intro to &quot;I Fall Down.&quot; However, a careful listen doesn't reveal any surface noise one would expect from a recording mastered from vinyl. The Holland tracks are a nice addition. \nThis is the original pressing on this label.\n\nÃ‚Â© 1999 &quot;For Love Or Money ? - A Guide To U2 Bootleg CDs&quot; and Sascha Kremer\n\nMultiTracker @ FrankFoo\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:247d7c8e06370c0272748d471533ed3fb4dc440f","amp;dn":"U2+-+The+Complete+%2783+Boston+Tapes+%28flac%29+%5BFrankFoo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"247d7c8e06370c0272748d471533ed3fb4dc440f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,125,124,142,6,55,12,2,114,116,141,71,21,51,237,63,180,220,68,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
