These rare recordings, most of which were released during the latter half of the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ70s and the year 1980, resemble -- and, in some cases, are -- L.A. records, meaning that they have the relaxed and polished Ã¢â‚¬Å“smooth soul meets soft rockÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sound that L.A. studios pumped out in torrents. The most Ã¢â‚¬Å“L.A.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ inclusion here would have to be Jaye P. Morgan's fluid version of Ã¢â‚¬Å“CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Hide Love,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ written by Skip Scarborough and also recorded by Creative Source, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, and Dionne Warwick; the singer is surrounded by an L.A.-based cast heard on heaps of other releases, including a pre-fame David Foster, Harvey Mason, Ray Parker Jr., a handful of Toto members, and the horn section from Tower of Power. A close second would be Ã¢â‚¬Å“Living Off the Love,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ an elegant number from Lee Ritenour associate Eric Tagg. Several artists were actually based in Hawaii, and all of them would have been worthy of warming up for the stateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Seawind. Just the names of certain acts -- Midnight Flyer, Tender Leaf, and the unhyphenated 1619 Bad Ass Band among them -- are likely to attract or repulse listeners. Indeed, this aims for insatiable, unapologetic lovers of smooth soul and soft rock -- those who will fall for Michael Franks playbook swipes like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Having my morning coffee/Peeling the cobwebs off me,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as heard in LilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Albert's Ã¢â‚¬Å“My Girl Friday.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Some of these songs can be slipped between well-known hits with no perceptible dip in quality, while the remainder is, at the very least, entertaining.&quot;/Allmusic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9888f3e7b7cc30232f9b488245241f72d4aaca73","amp;dn":"VA+-+Americana+-+Rock+Your+Soul+-+Blue+Eyed+Soul+%282011%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9888f3e7b7cc30232f9b488245241f72d4aaca73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,136,243,231,183,204,48,35,47,155,72,130,69,36,31,114,212,170,202,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
