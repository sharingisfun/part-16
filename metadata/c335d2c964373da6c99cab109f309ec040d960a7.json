The text explores in depth those areas of particular interest to anaesthetists: the respiratory pathway, the heart, the vertebral canal and its contents, the peripheral nerves, the autonomic nervous system, and the cranial nerves, and also includes sections on the anatomy of pain and other zones of anaesthetic interest.\nThis new 9th edition has been fully revised and updated to incorporate developments in regional techniques and the increased use of ultrasound.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c335d2c964373da6c99cab109f309ec040d960a7","amp;dn":"Anatomy+for+Anaesthetists%2C+9E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5Dq","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c335d2c964373da6c99cab109f309ec040d960a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,53,210,201,100,55,61,166,201,156,171,16,159,48,158,192,64,217,96,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
