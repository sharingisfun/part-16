And it takes JavaScriptâ€”a language familiar to all web developersâ€”out of the browser. With Node.js, you can build applications that run on your laptop or even the cloud. Learn the essentials of Node.js and start creating your own JavaScript applications in this introductory training course.\r\n\r\nAlex Banks shows how to install Node.js on a Mac or PC and work with the Node.js core: the global object, event loop, http module, and file system. Then he covers reading and writing data, streaming data, making http requests, and working with the node package manager (npm). In the final chapters, he shows how to start sessions on web servers, communicate with web servers and clients with WebSockets, use the Express framework to develop applications, and test and debug Node.js code. Want to speed up your Node.js workflow? Check out the tutorials on automating tasks with Grunt and npm scripts.\r\n\r\nTopics include:\r\nWhat is Node.js?\r\nInstalling Node.js\r\nUnderstanding the global object and global timing\r\nImporting the core modules\r\nHandling events\r\nCreating child processes\r\nReading, writing, and removing files\r\nWorking with file streams\r\nMaking http requests\r\nServing files and JSON data\r\nInstalling npm, the node package manager\r\nWorking with Express, the web server framework\r\nUsing WebSockets\r\nTesting and debugging Node.js code\r\nWorking with Grunt and Browserify\r\nAutomating tasks with npm scripts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7c860e9306be9087ce823b85b6fdf2b63ac1797","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Node.js+Essential+Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7c860e9306be9087ce823b85b6fdf2b63ac1797","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,200,96,233,48,107,233,8,124,232,35,184,91,111,223,43,99,172,23,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
