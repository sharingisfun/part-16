Using never-before-seen archival footage and intimate interviews -- with cell members and with the prosecutor and detective who were chasing them -- IF A TREE FALLS asks hard questions about environmentalism, activism, and the way we define terrorism.\r\nDrawing from striking archival footage -- much of it never before seen -- and intimate interviews with ELF members, and with the prosecutor and detective who were chasing them, IF A TREE FALLS explores the tumultuous period from 1995 until early 2001 when environmentalists were clashing with timber companies and law enforcement, and the word &quot;terrorism&quot; had not yet been altered by 9/11.\r\n\r\nA Film by Marshall Curry ; A co-production of ITVS in association with American Documentary, Lucky Hat Entertainment and the BBC\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cd/If-a-Tree-Falls-A-Story-of-the-Earth-Liberation-Front-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ea/If-a-Tree-Falls-A-Story-of-the-Earth-Liberation-Front-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/88/If-a-Tree-Falls-A-Story-of-the-Earth-Liberation-Front-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6c/If-a-Tree-Falls-A-Story-of-the-Earth-Liberation-Front-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/98/If-a-Tree-Falls-A-Story-of-the-Earth-Liberation-Front-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1f/If-a-Tree-Falls-A-Story-of-the-Earth-Liberation-Front-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5b/If-a-Tree-Falls-A-Story-of-the-Earth-Liberation-Front-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b9/If-a-Tree-Falls-A-Story-of-the-Earth-Liberation-Front-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9e/If-a-Tree-Falls-A-Story-of-the-Earth-Liberation-Front-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2b/If-a-Tree-Falls-A-Story-of-the-Earth-Liberation-Front-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/84/If-a-Tree-Falls-A-Story-of-the-Earth-Liberation-Front-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/27/If-a-Tree-Falls-A-Story-of-the-Earth-Liberation-Front-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a9/If-a-Tree-Falls-A-Story-of-the-Earth-Liberation-Front-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d0/If-a-Tree-Falls-A-Story-of-the-Earth-Liberation-Front-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4a/If-a-Tree-Falls-A-Story-of-the-Earth-Liberation-Front-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/56/If-a-Tree-Falls-A-Story-of-the-Earth-Liberation-Front-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: 2 529 Kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Per Second: 29.970 fps\r\nAudio Codec: AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate: 384 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\r\nAudio Streams: 6\r\nAudio Languages: english\r\nRunTime Per Part: 1h 25mn\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 1.74 GB\r\nSource: HDTV (Thanks to TrollHD)\r\nEncoded by: DocFreak08\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nSource: \nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=If_a_Tree_Falls:_A_Story_of_the_Earth_Liberation_Front","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21259042678ebacc958580252ad853c711ea6a5c","amp;dn":"PBS+POV+If+A+Tree+Falls+A+Story+of+the+Earth+Liberation+Front+72","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21259042678ebacc958580252ad853c711ea6a5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,37,144,66,103,142,186,204,149,133,128,37,42,216,83,199,17,234,106,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
