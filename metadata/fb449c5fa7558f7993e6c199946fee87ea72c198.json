The result is an \nexcellent mix, justifying the blending of the three sources to \nbreathe some life back into this very famous show.  \n\nAll three sources were pitched differently, the SBD being the \nsharpest while both AUDs where somewhat flat.  I used the SBD \nas my master timeline and synched both AUDs to it. AUD1 on \naverage had to be pitched up about .24 (24 cents) to achieve \npitch correction.   AUD2 on average had to be pitched up about \n.21 (21 cents) to achieve pitch correction - 1.00 being 100 \ncents which is a semitone.   I did not reference A=440 as I \nwanted to leave the speed of the SBD alone.  It is very close \nto A=440 though.\n\nd1t05 The PreFM (SBD) source was missing 3.875 seconds between\nThe Great Gig In The Sky and Money.  Both AUDs were trimmed \naccordingly to match. Some volume adjustments and quick cross\nfades were preformed making these edits completely smooth and \nmost likely totally undetectable.  What was missing was one\ncha-ching of the cash register sound effect.\n\nd1t08 The AUD2 source cuts at 41:07.515 and is missing 1:36.330\nof Any Colour You Like.  I used the AUD1 source to fill this\nhole.  The patch source was EQed, volume adjusted with a small \namount of limiting.  All in an effort to try and closely match\nthe sonic properties of the missing AUD2 source.   These edits \nare smooth and most likely undetectable.\n\nd1t10 The PreFM (SBD) has a long portion of cheering and \ntuning prior to the encore Echoes.  Unfortunately this was \nmissing from both AUD sources.  The SBD was trimmed to match \nand all 3 sources have multiple edits, mixing and crossfades \nto keep the flow between the last song and the encore sounding \nas natural as possible.  The result was good and this is smooth \nand natural sounding edit.  Although it is left sounding like\nEchoes was preformed very soon after the DSOTM potion instead \nof as the encore.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotes on the Source Material\n\nI love the fact that all 3 sources were raw.  It doesn&amp;#039;t\nsound or look like any noise reduction, EQing or any other\nDSP (digital sound processing) was done.  It was an honor \nand a privilege to work on this project.  It was also very\nvery cool to be sitting at my workstation, working on 3 \nimpressive recordings, in such beautiful condition, 33 years \nafter the fact.  Incredible.\n\nSBD\nVery clear, well balanced and a clean PreFM source.  However,\nthis is much more like a straight SBD feed than a PreFM.  \nMany PreFM sources I have heard have some element of a live \nfeel.  Either b/c there is a &quot;live mic&quot; feed (a microphone \nused to capture the sound of the room) or a similar technique\nwhere a microphone is used to capture the crowd, i.e. cheers, \netc.  On this recording the only way the room or crowd is \nheard at all is b/c it is being picked up thru the mics set \nup for the vocals.  The result is an extremely dry and flat \nsound making this an ideal source to use in a mix with an \nAUD recording(s).\n\nAUD1\nI find this to be the better of the two AUD recordings used\nin this mix.  Without a doubt this recording is made much\ncloser to the PA stacks than the AUD2 recording.  This\nrecording is very well balanced with good dynamic range\nand little to no hiss.  The low hiss and limited speed\nfluctuations tells me that this is indeed a digital recording\nmade off the masters.  A very interesting note is I could not\nfind any evidence of a tape flip.  Was a quick flip done and\na small patch used from AUD2?  Maybe.  Was this recording on\na 120 min cassette or possible a 60 min Reel?  Maybe.  The\nonly disappointment with the AUD1 recording is that it is\nmissing the encore, Echoes.\n\nAUD2\nAlthough not as punchy and clear an audience recording as \nthe AUD1 source, this is still a very good recording.  Made \nfrom further back in the venue this recording also has low \nhiss and limited speed fluctuations and tells me that this  \nis digital transcription made off the masters.  A long tape \nflip lasting 1 min and 36.33 seconds in Any Colour You Like \nis the only missing portion.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotes on the Sound\n\nThe PreFM (or SBD) source sounds great.  Conceptually all I \nwas trying to do here is to add some dimension to the SBD, \nwhich is dry but very crisp, by using the ambience of the AUDs.  \n\nThe PreFM sounds much more like a studio recording than a live \nrecording.  I have a hunch that a completely different feed was \nsetup for the BBC recording than the mix that was sent over the \nPA.  Evidence for that is found on sound &quot;Sample_6&quot;.  On that \nsample you can clearly hear that reverb has been added to the \nvocals on the PA mix but is not present on the BBC recording.  \nNot just reverb but other effects are lacking throughout, leaving \nan unnatural tone to Gilmour&amp;#039;s guitar among other shortcomings.  \nHis sound is noticeably flat and completely lacking that warm, \nwonderful tone that is the trademark of Gilmour.  This is a huge \nreason why I find this matrix mix to not only be a much better \nrepresentation of this live show but also a more pleasant \nlistening experience than the dry BBC mix. Your mileage may vary.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotes on the Sound Samples\n\nSample_1\n\nThis is just a clip of the matrix mix to give you an idea of\nwhat to expect.  Note the subtle changes in sound over the\nstraight SBD.  The extra warmth and lingering notes from the\nguitar and the additional &quot;thump&quot; to the bass.\n\nSample_2\n\nThis sample gives you a quick A/B comparison to the straight\nSBD.  You&amp;#039;ll hear a 10 second clip of the SBD followed by a\n10 second clip of the Matrix. 10 seconds SBD, 10 seconds Matrix\nand so on.  Four 10 second clips of each for a total 80 second\nclip.  I gave you a portion that gives the most drastic sound \ndifference btwn the 2 sources.  This quiet portion allows for\nmore of the AUD to get into the mix.  This is also a spot\nwhere the crowd gets into the song and has a &quot;clap along&quot;\ngoing. (There are no crossfades and transitions are abrupt.)\n\nAgain, this clip was used b/c the sound difference is the\nmost apparent during this particular portion.  The majority \nof the recording you will only hear more subtle sound \ndifferences btwn the SBD and the Matrix.  The difference in \ntone and the overall &quot;size&quot; of the recording being the most\nnoticeable differences to the PreFM (SBD) source.  The Matrix \nhas a much bigger feel to it.  This is even more obvious \non the 5.1 Surround Sound version.\n\nSample_3\n\nHere you will find the 3 second edit I made between The \nGreat Gig In The Sky and Money.  The original PreFM master \nedit was so transparent and seamless on the SBD source that\nI opted to duplicate the edit on the AUD sources rather \nthan patch the 3 seconds missing on the SBD source with\none or both AUD recordings.  That patch could only result\nin a jarring source change and be very distracting in my\nopinion.  So what we have here is the pleasurable listening\nversion versus the 3 second longer, complete version.  I\nwould bet that I am the first person in 33 years to even\nknow that 3.875 seconds is missing from the SBD.\n\nSample_4\n\nHere you will find the edit preformed to patch the 1:36.33\nmissing from Any Colour You Like in the AUD2 recording.  \nWhat you have here is a SBD+AUD1, 2 source matrix mix.  \nUnlike the majority of this Matrix which is a 3 source \nSBD+AUD1+AUD2 mix.\n\nSample_5\n\nThis sample was provided to give you an idea of what the\nMatrix mix will sound like as a SBD+AUD2, 2 source mix.\nWhat&amp;#039;s cool is between the patch on Any Colour and the\nentire Echoes the listener really ends up hearing 3 \ndifferent Matrix mixes.  You get the main body of the\nmatrix as a 3 source SBD+AUD1+AUD2 mix.  Plus you get\nthe 1:36.33 during Any Colour as a 2 source SBD+AUD1 mix.  \nAnd finally you get all of Echoes as another 2 source\nSBD+AUD2 mix.  There is really 3 uniquely different\nMatrix mixes found in this one recording.  However quiet\na bit of editing was done to make sure all 3 mixes \nsound damn close to the same.\n\nSample_6\n\nThe 30 second clip of the SBD is followed by the same 30\nsecond clip of the AUD1 source.  Listen to the reverb on\nRoger Water&amp;#039;s vocals and how it is missing on the SBD\nsource.  This is easily identified on the vocals but is \ntrue throughout the recording.  The BBC recording is much \ndifferent in how the vocals from the female backup singers \nsounded live too.  This is a big factor in why the tone is\nso different on Gilmour&amp;#039;s guitar on the SBD versus how he\nsounds on the Matrix mix or both of the AUD recordings.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotes on the Artwork\n\nIncluded you will find a folder with 58 different pieces of\nCD covert art that was made over the years.  The artwork\nfor this Matrix version are the separate JPEGs found in the \nmain folder and not with the 58 JPEGs in the folder that is \nmarked &quot;misc artwork&quot;.  I would like to thank floydart.org\nfor their wonderful database of Pink Floyd CD covers.  I\nwould also like to thank the &quot;Time In London&quot; version for\nthe artwork that is the basis for what is included with \nthis release.\n\nBoth DVD-Audio versions (the 5.1 Surround Sound and the \n24/96 Stereo) utilize a slide show of all the different \nartwork made for this same show over the years.  I love \nall the old artwork, some with the wrongs dates and funny\nbootleg names.  Please note that the DVD-Audio slide show \nmay or may not be functional with your DVD-A player.  This\nis the case with my Dennon, which does the slide show for \nabout 10 mins and the stops.  This has no effect on the\nplayback or the sound, only the visual portion.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nLineup\n\nDavid Gilmour (guitar, vocals)\nRoger Waters (bass, vocals)\nRichard Wright (keyboards, vocals)\nNick Mason (drums, percussions)\nDick Perry (saxophone)\nVanetta Fields (backing vocals)\nCarlena Williams (backing vocals)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional Formats\n\nThis show is available in the following formats:\n\n1.
