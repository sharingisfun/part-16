Patterns are provided for all doll projects; for girls, pattern pieces (in sizes 4, 6x and 8, with information on how to make each pattern larger) or tips for customizing commercial patterns are given. Projects range from matching dresses, skirts, nightgowns and summer tops for dolls/girls to such accessories as a sun hat and messenger bag, as well as a doll carrying bag for girls. Projects feature fabrics in popular colors and the latest designs. A special feature is a 30-minute how-to DVD with the author, hosted by Nancy Zeiman, included with the book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bdb6f97ae32c48a33abecf36a567e158ebfa94e","amp;dn":"All+Dolled+Up%3A+Sewing+Clothes+and+Accessories+for+Girls+and+Thei","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bdb6f97ae32c48a33abecf36a567e158ebfa94e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,219,111,151,174,50,196,138,51,171,236,243,106,86,126,21,142,191,169,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
