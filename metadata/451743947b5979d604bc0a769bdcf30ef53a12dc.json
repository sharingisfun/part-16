This is real.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œWAYN Radio\n\nJuste and Jack are two cocaine dealers who don't get along. OneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a strict A-type with a gambling problem, the otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a recently-turned vampire who's horribly irresponsible. But when they visit Detroit for an easy payoff, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re forced to put aside their differences in order to recover a treasure of stolen cash. Along the way, they see the good and bad of Detroit as it's changing.\n\n&quot;Blood Money&quot; is the answer to the half-hearted Detroit documentary, while delivering a smart and entertaining storyline. Long live pulp fiction.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://gumroad.com/l/blood&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://gumroad.com/l/blood&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ashurcollective.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ashurcollective.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:451743947b5979d604bc0a769bdcf30ef53a12dc","amp;dn":"Blood+Money+-+The+Road+To+Detroit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"451743947b5979d604bc0a769bdcf30ef53a12dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,23,67,148,123,89,121,214,4,188,10,118,155,220,243,14,245,58,18,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
