John Ireland, Yvonne De Carlo, Jack Kruschen, John Carradine\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076665/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076665/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTwo things were huge in the Satanic 70s. One of these was of course Satanism, but the other . . . the cheerleaders! It seems like every other film it was a horror film was about cheerleaders. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get me wrong I like cheerleaders; I dated a cheerleader or two, but as a sub-genre, not all that interesting. But you add Satanism to the mix, and the whole thing just becomes twisted fun. Is there such a film? As a matter of fact there is. What would it feel like that would be called? SatanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cheerleaders of course.\n\nSatanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cheerleaders is a full on product of the 70s. Which means itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just sexy for sexy sake and in this case, it depends on your own personal fetishes. The film starts off at the beach, where the girls and their coach are enjoying some fun in the sun with some friends. Little do they know, a school janitor is actually a Satanic witch, who was cursing the girls clothes, literally.\n\n\nVideo: XviD, 640x480, 23.976 fps, 1907 kbps, 01h32m27s\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\n\nDVD Rip, not high definition, English audio, no subtitles\n\nscreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PaCjOAaGG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PaCjOAaGG&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aackbaAGG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aackbaAGG&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aacKdaAGG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aacKdaAGG&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aaCKfaaGg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aaCKfaaGg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOriginally posted at RL, August 2012.
