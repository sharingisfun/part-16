To faithfully reproduce the elusive analog sound in your DAW, we recommend using Trinity eQ in all tracks where you need to shape or even just color the sound.\nOn single track: Insert Trinity eQ on the audio tracks in any position of the effects chain (to taste). Trinity eQ sounds great on any instrument and voices.\nOn master track: Trinity eQ is inserted on the mixbus, or group bus, as last insert giving at the whole mix the classic British console sound.\n\n\n\n   Key Features\n\nDespite the digital revolution in the pro audio industry, many of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top albums are still mixed with analog outboard gear. Mixing with analog devices often still sounds better to many people. There is a very elusive and almost &quot;magical&quot; quality imparted from analog signal chains that is missing in the digital realm. There appears to be more weight to a mix, and the overall sound is more three dimensional. Analog devices produce electrical artifacts that affect frequency response, add harmonics, cause signal clipping and increase noise. These artifacts, which audio engineers often consider the character of a particular device, result from a combination of factors such as component grade, technology type (i.e. vacuum tubes, ICs, transistors), power supply specifications, equipment casing and other variables.\n\nDepending on the circuit characteristics, input signal frequency response varies. Some circuits cut frequencies, others boost them. This behavior is part of the overall device character and should not be confused with user adjustable EQ.\nTotal harmonic distortion (THD) is based on the levels of the odd and even harmonics of an input signal, usually at a level much lower than the fundamental level. THD balance and decay are circuit dependent, and thus differ from device to device.\nCrossTalk and Noise are two elements which every designer tends to avoid to not affect the audio quality. Since in the analog world they can't be avoided, fortunately in digital domain with Volterra Technology we have reduced the noise at less of -120dBfs and completely avoided CrossTalk during the sampling.\n\nThe result is an optimum full quality sound from a like-new working condition hardware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Controls\n\nInput Gain: sets the level at the input of the plugin. The range is from -Ã¢Ë†Å¾ dB to +6 dB.\n\nOutput Gain: sets the level at the output of the plugin. The range is from -8 dB to +6 dB.\nHigh Pass Filter: These control switches engage the HPF by clicking ON or OFF. The HPF has fixed frequency at 70Hz and the slope is 18dB per octave.\n\nLow Frequency: The low band is controlled by knob, delivering smooth shelving equalization. The frequency is fixed to 80Hz  and the available gain range is approximately Ã‚Â±15dB. The control switches engage the low band by clicking ON or OFF.\n\nLow Mid Frequency: The low mid frequency band is controlled by two knobs, delivering smooth semi-parametric low midrange equalization with a fixed bandwidth. The low mid frequency is selected by the upper knob and the available range is from 100Hz to 2000Hz. The lower knob controls the available gain which is approximately Ã‚Â±15dB. The control switches engage the low mid band by clicking ON or OFF.\n\nHigh Mid Frequency: The high mid frequency band is controlled by two knobs, delivering smooth semi-parametric high midrange equalization with a fixed bandwidth. The high mid frequency is selected by the upper knob and the available range is from 2000Hz to 8000Hz. The lower knob controls the available gain which is approximately Ã‚Â±15dB. The control switches engage the low mid band by clicking ON or OFF.\n\nHigh Frequency: The high band is controlled by knob, delivering smooth shelving equalization. The frequency is fixed to 12kHz  and the available gain range is approximately Ã‚Â±15dB. The control switches engage the high band by clicking ON or OFF.\n\nBypass: This switch control sets the plugin operative or bypassed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Presets\n\n\nHigh Pass Filter: The HPF switch inserts a 70Hz High Pass Filter with a rolloff of 18dB per octave into circuit after the input. This may be used to eliminate unwanted low-frequency noises such as rumble, pops, camera buzz.\n\nLow Shelf: The LF switch inserts a Low Frequency Shelf Filter fixed at 80Hz with Ã‚Â±15dB of adjustable gain. This frequency represents the punch in bass drums, bass guitar, fat synths and some really serious male singers. Used in conjunction with the HPF, you can boost the LF without injecting tons of infrasonic debris into the mix.\n\nMid Bell: The LMF and HMF switches inserts the Low Mid Frequency and High Mid Frequency Bell Filter respectively, they provide Ã‚Â±15dB of adjustable gain at the frequency determined by their frequency knobs. LMF extends down to 100Hz which includes the male vocal range and the fundamentals of some lower instruments. HMF extends up to 8000Hz which includes the female vocals range as well as the fundamentals and harmonics for many instruments.\n\nHigh Shelf: The HF switch inserts an High Frequency Shelf Filter fixed at 12kHz with Ã‚Â±15dB of adjustable gain. Use this to add sizzle to cymbals, and an overall sense of transparency or edge to the keyboard, vocals, guitarsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Turn it down a little to recude sibilance, or to hide tape hiss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Sys Requirements\n\nWindows Minumum\n\nXp Sp2\nRam 2 Gb\nHd 120 Gb\nScreen Resolution 1024x768\nAudio Host VST compatible\nCPU Dual Core\n\nWindows Recommended\n\nLatest 64 bits version\n\nRam 24 Gb\nHd 120 Gb SSD\nScreen Resolution Full Hd\nAudio Host VST compatible\nLatest multicore CPU\n\n\n\n\n[Installation]\n\n  UnRaR\n\n1.Uninstall previous versions.\n2.Install the plugin.\n3.Run our keygen.\n4.Select a product.\n5.Click GENERATE to generate *.AUT file.\n6.Save *.AUT to the same location to the plugin.\n\n\nOur Keygen gets Challenge Code automatically from your computer.\nHowever, you can get that code manually.\nChallenge Codes are identical for all plugins.\n(You don't need to load *.SER file one by one).\n\n1.Uninstall previous versions.\n2.Install the plugin.\n3.Run the plugin.\n *.SER (Challenge Code File) will be generated.\n4.Run our keygen.\n5.Select a product.\n6.Click &quot;Get From File&quot; and open that *.SER file.\n7.Click GENERATE to generate *.AUT file.\n8.Save *.AUT to the same location to the plugin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
