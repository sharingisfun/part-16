Jung proposed and developed the concepts of the extraverted and the introverted personality, archetypes, and the collective unconscious. His work has been influential in psychiatry and in the study of religion, literature, and related fields.\n\nIndividuation is the central concept of analytical psychology. Jung considered individuation, the psychological process of integrating the opposites, including the conscious with the unconscious while still maintaining their relative autonomy, to be the central process of human development.\n\nJung created some of the best known psychological concepts, including the archetype, the collective unconscious, the complex, and synchronicity. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), a popular psychometric instrument, has been developed from Jung's theories.\n\nJung saw the human psyche as &quot;by nature religious&quot;, and made this religiousness the focus of his explorations. Jung is one of the best known contemporary contributors to dream analysis and symbolization.\n\nThough he was a practicing clinician and considered himself to be a scientist,[5] much of his life's work was spent exploring tangential areas, including Eastern and Western philosophy, alchemy, astrology, and sociology, as well as literature and the arts. His interest in philosophy and the occult led many to view him as a mystic.\n\n\n--- eBooks [PDF] ---\n\nAion: Researches into the Phenomenology of the Self\n\nContributions to Analytical Psychology (1928)\n\nFour Archetypes\n\nFreud and Psychoanalysis\n\nJung on Christianity (Encountering Jung)\n\nMan and His Symbols\n\nMemories, Dreams, Reflections\n\nModern Man in Search of a Soul\n\nPsychological Types\n\nPsychology and Alchemy\n\nPsychology and Religion: East and West\n\nPsychology and the Occult\n\nPsychology of the Unconscious\n\nSeven Sermons to the Dead\n\nStudies in Word-Association (1916)\n\nThe Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious\n\nThe Association Method (1910)\n\nThe I Ching (or Book of Changes)\n\nThe Portable Jung\n\nThe Practice of Psychotherapy: Essays on the Psychology of the Transference and Other Subjects\n\nThe Psychology of Dementia Praecox (1909) [Schizophrenia]\n\nThe Psychology of Kundalini Yoga\n\nThe Red Book [Liber Novus]\n\nThe Spiritual Problem of Modern Man (1928)\n\nThe Structure and Dynamics of the Psyche - [Synchronicity]\n\nTheory of Psychoanalysis (1915)\n\nTwo Essays in Analytical Psychology\n\nC.
