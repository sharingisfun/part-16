Xubuntu is a desktop Linux distribution focusing on usability and performance through its classic Xfce desktop. From the release announcement: &quot;The Xubuntu team is pleased to announce the immediate release of Xubuntu 14.10. To celebrate the 14.10 code name 'Utopic Unicorn' and to demonstrate the easy customisability of Xubuntu, highlight colors have been turned pink for this release. You can easily revert this change by using the theme configuration application under the Settings Manager; simply turn Custom Highlight Colors 'Off' and click 'Apply'. Of course, if you wish, you can change the highlight color to something you like better than the default blue. Starting with Xubuntu 14.10, you should use pkexec instead of gksudo for running graphical applications with root access from the terminal for improved security.&quot; See also the release notes for a full changelog and a list of known issues","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99cb6864b28574d0f38408ee6a1e2696aaf01396","amp;dn":"Xubuntu+14.10+x64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99cb6864b28574d0f38408ee6a1e2696aaf01396","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,203,104,100,178,133,116,208,243,132,8,238,106,30,38,150,170,240,19,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
