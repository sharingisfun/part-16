Still, it does a good job of mixing monster hits by Barry McGuire, Sonny Bono, Dion, the Kingston Trio, the Temptations, and Edwin Starr with more obscure cuts. Country Joe's &quot;I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-To-Die Rag&quot; is here, as well as Sonny Bono's self-pitying &quot;Laugh at Me,&quot; the pre-electric Donovan cover of Buffy Sainte-Marie's &quot;Universal Soldier,&quot; and Manfred Mann's fine, overlooked cover of Dylan's &quot;With God on Our Side.&quot; The most hard-to-find songs span the opposite ends of the spectrum. &quot;It's Good News Week,&quot; a 1966 hit for the Jonathan King-led group Hedgehoppers Anonymous, is a lightweight catalog of social ills that retains considerable period charm. Far more earnest is Phil Ochs' &quot;I Ain't Marching Anymore,&quot; represented here by the non-LP, electric folk-rock version released as a single in 1966. Although it made no commercial impact, it holds up to the best protest anthems of the era, both musically and lyrically.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/songs-of-protest-r23754&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/songs-of-protest-r23754&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000032M5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000032M5&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
