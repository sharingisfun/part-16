It ran for two series, of six and seven episodes, in 1988 and 1990.\n\nThe series was located in the British town of Chelmsford in AD 123, and concerned the power struggle between Roman governor Aulus Paulinus (Jimmy Mulville) and the British chieftain, Badvoc (Rory McGrath). Britain is a miserable place, cold and wet ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ just the place to exile Aulus for accidentally insulting the Emperor&amp;#039;s horse, but also give him something useful to do. Aulus was a rather delicate Roman, who was usually outwitted by the scheming Badvoc, who hadn&amp;#039;t had a haircut for twenty-five years. Many of the other regular &quot;Hat Trick&quot; actors, previously seen in shows such as Who Dares Wins, also appeared.\n\nThe first series is now available to rent from 4 on Demand.\n\nPrincipal cast\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tRory McGrath -- Badvoc, British chieftain \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tJimmy Mulville -- Aulus Paulinus, Roman Governor of Britain \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tPhilip Pope -- Grasientus, Aulus&amp;#039; Brother in-law.
