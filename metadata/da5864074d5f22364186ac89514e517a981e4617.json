I found it while searching.\nMost of it downloaded in no time at all, but it took several days to\nget the last pieces.  So, I've decided to upload it here in the hope\nthat it will see a little more TLC.  I'll seed it for awhile when I can.\n\nI've been wanting this old album for years.  Unfortunately, this rip\nis from a badly damaged source.  See the readme.txt file.  The\noriginal uploader did what he could with what he had.  I'd love\nto get ahold of original wav files for this album and do a full\nrestoration on it.  If anyone has a better rip, or torrent of one\nplease leave comments.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da5864074d5f22364186ac89514e517a981e4617","amp;dn":"Gordon+Lightfoot%281962%29+-+Two+Tones+at+the+Village+Corner+%28with+T","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da5864074d5f22364186ac89514e517a981e4617","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,88,100,7,77,95,34,54,65,134,172,137,81,78,81,122,152,30,70,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
