Ellie is young enough to still schlep to auditions back and forth across L.A., changing wardrobes and slapping on makeup en route, but just old enough that the future feels &quot;more like a threat than a promise.&quot; She lives with her vacant musician boyfriend (Mark Pellegrino), who leaves her just about as dissatisfied as any other part of her life, and has a loose definition of the word &quot;fidelity.&quot; Helping make sense of their surreal and humiliating Hollywood existence is her best friend Sam (Rebecca Rigg), another out-of-work actress trying her hand at design, who attends acting classes with Ellie to stay sharp. When Ellie gets into a fender bender with a guy who claims he's a cinematographer (Scott Coffey), her perspective on her work and the dating world starts to change. Chevy Chase also makes an appearance in this series of Hollywood vignettes, playing Ellie's agent. Watts, Coffey, and Pellegrino all worked together on David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, where Watts had her breakout performance, and Ellie Parker grew out of the friendship forged between Watts and director/screenwriter Coffey. It was shot on digital video over the course of five years, having begun its life as a series of shorts featuring Watts' character.\n\nAlso known as: Ellie Parker - Schauspielerin, ÃÂ­ÃÂ»ÃÂ»ÃÂ¸ ÃÅ¸ÃÂ°Ã‘â‚¬ÃÂºÃÂµÃ‘â‚¬.\nCountry: USA\nStudio: Kailua Films, Strand Releasing\nDuration: 1:35:29\n\nInfo:\n\n[mediainfo]\n\nVideo\nID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP : 1\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 35mn\nBit rate : 2 963 Kbps\nWidth : 704 pixels\nHeight : 400 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.421\nStream size : 1.98 GiB (87%)\nWriting library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness : Big\nCodec ID : 2000\nDuration : 1h 35mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 306 MiB (13%)\nAlignment : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duratio : 500 ms\n\n[/mediainfo]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d059236e7cb2a263d23ea35510b1299152d6f6cc","amp;dn":"Ellie+Parker+2005+DVDRip+Naomi+Watts%2C+Keanu+Reeves%2C+Chevy+Chase","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d059236e7cb2a263d23ea35510b1299152d6f6cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,89,35,110,124,178,162,99,210,62,163,85,16,177,41,145,82,214,246,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
