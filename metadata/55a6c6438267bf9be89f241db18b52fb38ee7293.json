He includes the fundamental considerations and the physics of the necessary laser, UV, IR and RF technologies, as well as coding and information theory considerations.\n\nThe author explores future possibilities providing the reader with a comprehensive view of the many ways signals from aliens could be sent and explains why the search using RF leaves more than 99% of the electromagnetic spectrum unexamined. He also demonstrates the many parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, considering the next likely steps in this unique enterprise. Given manÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s intrinsic nature to explore, the search will continue in one form or many, until success is achieved, which may be tomorrow or a millennium away.\n\nIn summary, Monte Ross proposes to get around the failure of a fruitless search at radio frequencies by developing, in a precise way, the argument for searching for transmissions in the optical region of the electromagnetic spectrum.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55a6c6438267bf9be89f241db18b52fb38ee7293","amp;dn":"The+Search+for+Extraterrestrials+-+Intercepting+Alien+Signals+20","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55a6c6438267bf9be89f241db18b52fb38ee7293","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,166,198,67,130,103,191,155,232,159,36,29,177,139,82,251,56,238,114,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
