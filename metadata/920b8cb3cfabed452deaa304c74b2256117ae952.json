The album was released on November 30, 1982 by Epic Records as the follow-up to Jackson's critically and commercially successful 1979 album Off the Wall. Thriller explores similar genres to those of Off the Wall, including funk, soul, pop, easy listening, R&amp;B, rock and post-disco music. With a production budget of $750,000, recording sessions took place between April and November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California.[13] Assisted by producer Quincy Jones, Jackson wrote four of Thriller's nine tracks. In just over a year, Thriller becameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and currently remainsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the best-selling album of all time, with estimated sales between 65-110 million copies worldwide, as well as the best-selling album in the United States. Seven of the album's nine songs were released as singles, and all reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards at the 1984 Grammys. Thriller cemented Jackson's status as one of the preeminent pop stars of the late 20th century, and enabled him to break down racial barriers via his appearances on MTV and meetings with President Ronald Reagan at the White House. The album was one of the first to use music videos as successful promotional toolsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the videos for &quot;Thriller&quot;, &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and &quot;Beat It&quot; all received regular rotation on MTV. In 2001, a special edition issue of the album was released, which contains additional audio interviews, a demo recording and the song &quot;Someone In the Dark&quot;, which was a Grammy-winning track from the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial storybook. In 2008, the album was reissued again as Thriller 25, containing re-mixes that feature contemporary artists, a previously unreleased song and a DVD. Thriller ranked number 20 on Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list in 2003, and was listed by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers at number three in its Definitive 200 Albums of All Time. Thriller was preserved by the Library of Congress to the National Recording Registry, as it was deemed &quot;culturally significant&quot;.\n\nAmazon.co.uk Review By John Milward - Michael Jackson's Thriller is the bestselling album of all time, with 45 million worldwide sales powered by eight Grammy Awards. The 1982 album was also a success from which the pop superstar never really recovered--subsequent albums seemed to have no other goal than to beat the records set by Thriller. The highly- polished sound of Quincy Jones's production sounds almost organic compared to Jackson's more recent work, and in the same regard, Thriller was significantly slicker than its predecessor, Off the Wall. Both albums established a Jackson style that aimed for the dance floor with songs built on a state-of-the-art bed of percussion and keyboards. Elements of milestone Thriller tracks like &quot;Billie Jean&quot; (arguably Jackson's best-ever performance) and &quot;Beat It&quot; (with its hard- rock solo by guitarist Eddie Van Halen) influenced not just Jackson's records, but those of the entire dance-pop world. On the song &quot;Thriller&quot;, Jackson indulged his taste for the juvenile and invited Vincent Price to rap in a really scary voice. With Thriller the album, Jackson created a different kind of monster--a hit album of such magnitude that it would have an irrevocable impact not just on the singer's art, but on his altogether kooky life. \n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\n[02] Baby Be Mine\n[03] The Girl Is Mine                \t&gt; With Paul MacCartney\n[04] Thriller\n[05] Beat It\n[06] Billie Jean\n[07] Human Nature\n[08] P.Y.T.
