I'll just give the description for the first book,due to the other books' descriptions revealing spoilers. This is an independent author, couldn't even find an ISBN number.\n\nMarcus Rainwater was barely 13 when the N47Q virus struck. Everyone he knew or loved died within a two week span. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lived on his own and survived for the past five years. With the training he was taught by his parents, he has set up a small protected compound in the southern region of the Appalachian Mountains where he lives alone. For a person living alone, danger can come from anywhere and sharing his little slice of Appalachia with resurrected prehistoric creatures isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t going to make it any easier.\n\n\nSupport the author if you like the books!!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ff05d06d55e3f0b31b546ed5b9b0fd989793176","amp;dn":"Everette+Morgan+-Tommorow%27s+Past+%281-5%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ff05d06d55e3f0b31b546ed5b9b0fd989793176","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,240,93,6,213,94,63,11,49,181,70,237,91,155,15,217,137,121,49,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
