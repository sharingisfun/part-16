That is to smuggle opium. Aierdesi is a honest English officer and he tried to prevent them from their criminal conducts but was murdered by Linsa and Fengchu. What was worse, in order to stamp out the source of trouble and avoid his offspringÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s revenge, they determine to get rid of his son who is only 10 years old. Fortunately, he was saved by Hong Lianhui (a religion organization in ancient China). They taught him a lot of skills, including the martial art. He grew up together with his good pals like Qian Hua, Tian Ying, Shan Gang etc in a small village.\n\nAs Johnson grows up, he devotes himself to the fighting with Linsa and Feng Chu. The fighting is beset with difficulties and obstacles and really nothing short of a heroic spirit can help surmount them.
