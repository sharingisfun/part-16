Scott, Sue Lyon, and Harry Morgan\nWritten by William Rose\nDirected by Irvin Kershner\n\n\nIt's hard to believe that a film of this pedigree has yet to receive a proper DVD (let alone Blu-Ray) remastering and re-release. Written by William Rose (&quot;It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;), directed by Irvin Kershner (&quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;) and featuring a tour de force performance from George C. Scott, this film is on its way to being a great lost classic. \n\nMordecai Jones (George C. Scott) is a rural con artist who takes on young army deserter Curley (Michael Sarrazin) as his protÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© and teaches him the tricks of the trade. Sheriff Slade (Harry Morgan, of &quot;M*A*S*H*&quot; fame) is in hot pursuit of the pair, and rich girl Bonnie Lee Packard (the stunning Sue Lyon) becomes romantically involved with Curley and helps the fleeing duo stay one step ahead of the sheriff. Playing a con artist allows Scott the opportunity to trot out just about every accent under the sun, and he does so with zest. People primarily familiar with Scott as General George S. Patton, or perhaps Ebeneezer Scrooge, will be amazed at his gift for comedy. \n\nI transferred this version directly from an import DVD. While not digitally remastered, it's a very good copy--at least comparable to broadcast cable television. Here in its original aspect ratio of 16:9 (widescreen), this is about as good a copy as you are going to get until someone bothers to release this gem. Here's hoping you get as big a kick out of this movie as I did!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97e55cb7bc0799fcab71c23feab13f3bf6f34bb2","amp;dn":"The+Flim+Flam+Man+%281967%29+George+C.+Scott","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97e55cb7bc0799fcab71c23feab13f3bf6f34bb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,229,92,183,188,7,153,252,171,113,194,63,234,177,63,59,246,243,75,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
