It was the first Survival Horror game, it was also the first to feature a fully 3D character walking on pre-renderized backgrounds.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe player assumes the role of either Edward Carnby, a private investigator who is sent to find a piano in the loft for an antique dealer, or Emily Hartwood, Jeremy's niece, who is also interested in finding the piano because she believes a secret drawer in it has a note in which Jeremy explains his suicide. The player, either as Carnby or Hartwood, goes to the mansion to investigate. As the player enters the house, the doors mysteriously slam shut behind him or her. Reluctantly, he or she continues up to the attic. In that room, the action begins.\n\n\nPlot\n\nIt is the year 1923. The owner of the Louisiana mansion Derceto, Jeremy Hartwood, died a few days ago. The police report, filed after a cursory investigation, concluded that the well-known artist had taken his own life. His devoted butler confirmed that Hartwood had been suffering from considerable mental depression for some months. He had placed even more strain on his already delicate health by translating the many ancient manuscripts contained in Derceto's extensive library. He also suffered from insomnia and the few hours of sleep he had were troubled by particularly disturbing nightmares. He appeared to be convinced of a mysterious presence in the old house.\n\nDerceto is now empty. Rumours abound of a curse or of an evil power dwelling within its walls. Such stories are not uncommon with houses like Derceto, especially in this particular area. For some days now, however, a cloud of doubt has hung over your mind...\n\nWhat are those strange lights inside the house during nightfall? What could account for the eerie noises to be heard each time you approach? Why did Jeremy commit suicide? What compels you towards the house? What is DercetoÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs terrible secret?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9a274362a458114b052a0a9717e7a91bdaef96f","amp;dn":"Alone+In+The+Dark+1+%5BPCDOS1992%5D+-+Portable.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9a274362a458114b052a0a9717e7a91bdaef96f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,162,116,54,42,69,129,20,176,82,160,169,113,126,122,145,189,174,249,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
