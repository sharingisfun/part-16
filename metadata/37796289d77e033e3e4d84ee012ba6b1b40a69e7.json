When his father Montrose goes missing, 22-year-old Army veteran Atticus Turner embarks on a road trip to New England to find him, accompanied by his Uncle Georgeâ€”publisher of The Safe Negro Travel Guideâ€”and his childhood friend Letitia. On their journey to the manor of Mr. Braithwhiteâ€”heir to the estate that owned one of Atticusâ€™s ancestorsâ€”they encounter both mundane terrors of white America and malevolent spirits that seem straight out of the weird tales George devours.\r\n\r\nAt the manor, Atticus discovers his father in chains, held prisoner by a secret cabal named the Order of the Ancient Dawnâ€”led by Samuel Braithwhite and his son Calebâ€”which has gathered to orchestrate a ritual that shockingly centers on Atticus. And his one hope of salvation may be the seed of hisâ€”and the whole Turner clanâ€™sâ€”destruction.\r\n\r\nA chimerical blend of magic, power, hope, and freedom that stretches across time, touching diverse members of two black families, Lovecraft Country is a devastating kaleidoscopic portrait of racismâ€”the terrifying specter that continues to haunt us today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Kevin Kenerly\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37796289d77e033e3e4d84ee012ba6b1b40a69e7","amp;dn":"Matt+Ruff+-+Lovecraft+Country","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37796289d77e033e3e4d84ee012ba6b1b40a69e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,121,98,137,215,126,3,62,62,77,132,238,1,43,166,177,180,10,105,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
