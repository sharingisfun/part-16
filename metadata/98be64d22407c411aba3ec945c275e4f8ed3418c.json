Through much hard work and a slew of infamous live performances at New York area clubs like LÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Amours, Overkill established a reputation as a blue-collar, working manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s metal band. After the band released a self-financed EP in 1984, Overkill broke onto the scene in 1985 with Feel The Fire, a crushing thrash assault on Megaforce Records, the label to beat when it came to 80ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s thrash. The self-proclaimed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWrecking CrewÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ - originally consisting of vocalist Bobby ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlitzÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Ellsworth, bassist D.D. Verni, guitarist Bobby Gustafson, and drummer Rat Skates - were on a tear, borrowing heavily from punk rock roots while adding a venomous metal crunch that allowed them to compete favorably with peers like Testament, Anthrax, and Megadeth.\n\n- By 1987ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Taking Over, the band had worked their way up to a deal with Atlantic Records. This relationship would last another 7 years based on the strength and consistency of OverkillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music.\n\n- 1988ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Under The Influence and 1989ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s The Years Of Decay represent Overkill in their prime. Sid Falck would replace Rat Skates on drums to bring his own brutal percussive assault to VerniÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s already powerful rhythm section. The band had already established a rabid fan base with songs like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRotten To The CoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHammerheadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (as well as their infamous cover of D.O.A.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFuck YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), and new songs like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEvil Never DiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHello From The GutterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ would become Overkill mainstays as well. A video for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHello From The GutterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was garnering much fan response when it received play on MTVÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHeadbangers BallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\n\n\nAlbum List:\n\n(1983) Power In Black [Demo] [256]\n(1984) Feel The Fire Demo [160]\n(1984) Rotten To The Core Demo [160]\n(1985) Feel the Fire [V0]\n(1987) Taking Over [V0]\n(1988) Fuck You [V0]\n(1988) Under the Influence [V0]\n(1989) Power In Black - And Then Some [160]\n(1989) The Years of Decay [V0]\n(1991) Horrorscope [V0]\n(1993) I Hear Black [V0]\n(1994) W.F.O.
