Benzi (Yftach Katzur) is the sensitive romantic, Yudale is shy and overweight (Zachi Noy) and Momo (Jonathan Sagall) is the ladies' man. Hugely popular in Israel, Going Steady was the first of many Lemon Popsicle sequels, including Hot Bubblegum and Baby Love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7221913ccd6ad0c94014b290206a14e4fd672581","amp;dn":"Going+Steady+%281979%29+Fart_Toy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7221913ccd6ad0c94014b290206a14e4fd672581","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,33,145,60,205,106,208,201,64,20,178,144,32,106,20,228,253,103,37,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
