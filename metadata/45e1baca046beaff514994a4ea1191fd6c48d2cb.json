It depicts the band arriving at a large mansion where a large party is occurring along with many women. Andrew Dice Clay stands at the door and acts as a bouncer. Intercuting with scenes of the band performing the song in front of the houseguests, the video follows a mysterious blonde woman. This woman proceeds to seduce and have sex with all the members of the band. The climax occurs when the blonde walks past the band and they realize that they all have slept with her. It ends with them toasting to their conquests and praising the madness of the party.\n\nHinder is an American band from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma that was formed in 2001 by drummer Cody Hanson, guitarist Joe Garvey, and Singer Austin Winkler.
