Fascinating and engaging, this text illustrates the scientific method and guides students to answer these fundamental questions: What are we? and How do we know? In discussing the interplay between evidence and hypothesis, the authors provide not just facts but a conceptual framework for understanding the logic of science. The book vividly conveys their love of astronomy and illustrates how students can comprehend their place in the universe by grasping a small set of physical laws. Crafting a story about astronomy, the authors show students how to ask questions to gradually puzzle out the beautiful secrets of the physical world. The revision addresses new developments in astrophysics and cosmology, plus the latest discoveries, including evidence of a new world beyond Pluto and new evidence of dark energy and the acceleration of the universe.\n\nBeen using tpb for years. This is my very small attempt to say thank you.\n\nOh yea FUCK SOPA!!!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87462748be4d6e29c9cf7baeed4806178752ca5d","amp;dn":"Universe+Solar+System%2C+Stars%2C+and+Galaxies+-+7th+Edition.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87462748be4d6e29c9cf7baeed4806178752ca5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,70,39,72,190,77,110,41,201,207,123,174,237,72,6,23,135,82,202,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
