However, tracks such as N-R-G, his first hit, the catchy I Dream of You, and quirky late chart-troubling singles such as the Elvis-sampling Space Jungle and rave-oriented Flashback Jack, from the underwhelming Doctor Adamski's Musical Pharmacy long-player, stand the test of time surprisingly well, and remind us that Adamski should be remembered as more than just a footnote on the early 90s Electronic revival.\nAmazon Review by By Scaroth, Last of the Jagaroth.\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Killer\n[02] N-R-G\n[03] I Dream Of You\n[04] Tekno Krisna\n[05] The Bass Line Changed My Life\n[06] In Your Face\n[07] Magik Piano\n[08] A Brand New World\n[09] M25\n[10] I Love Technology (Part 1)\n[11] Into Orbit\n[12] Back To Front (The Rub It Vocal Mix)\n[13] The Space Jungle\n[14] Flashback Jack (Flashback Of The Club Mix)\n[15] Never Goin' Down' (Incorporating Future Freak)\n[16] Get Your Body\n[17] Killer (Remix)\n\nCD Play Time - 01h:17m:37s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 185mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
