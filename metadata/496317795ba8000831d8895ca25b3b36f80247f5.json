From their humble beginnings as a 2 1/2-acre raspberry field, Earthbound now grows and distributes organic produce nationally. Co-founder Myra Goodman and her daughter Marea are skillful home cooks, and the proximity to their fields of fresh vegetables and fruits made it easy to develop creativeÃ¢â‚¬â€and definitely deliciousÃ¢â‚¬â€dishes that are not only heavy on the produce, they just happen to be vegan!\n\nUsing the freshest ingredients and offering intriguing flavor combinations, these 100 plant-based recipes are completely free of meat or dairy. As you gain insight on organics and essential components like nuts and seeds, soy, and coconut, you'll also learn about the practical and personal reasons to go vegan.\n\nTaking you from breakfast and lunch to dinner and dessert with such satisfying delights as Quinoa Banana Skillet Bake, Slow Simmered Beans with Tuscan Kale, Thai Lettuce Rolls, and Very Chocolately Chocolate Brownies, Myra and Marea share their diverse and delicious collection of recipes. They excel in salads and Marea's deliciously skewed Eccentric Caesar with its cashew and curry based dressing are just a taste of what's to offer. Choosing a more plant-based diet was a simple choice for them and much too tempting to resist. Their goal?
