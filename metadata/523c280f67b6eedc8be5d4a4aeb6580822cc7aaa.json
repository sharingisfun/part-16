In conclusion, before he ever had a recording contract. I particularly enjoy the version of &quot;Fixin' to Die&quot; on this recording, love that early, gritty Dylan sound.\n\nThe first session is a series of home recordings at fellow folk enthusiast's Sid Gleason's home, while the second is a concert put up for Dylan by Izzy Young at the Carnegie Chapter Hall.\n\nA must have for any Dylan fans, let's you truly see how he progressed through the years and what the roots of his folk style are (all the songs are pretty much covers, he didn't really start writing songs for another two years).\n\nRecorded on vintage 50's equipment, so quality ranges from &quot;Good&quot; to &quot;Average&quot;. Definitely not horrible, but not up par to studio quality (naturally)\n\nCould not find the FLAC fingerprints, so I apologize to our audiophiles...\n\nYou can change the .nfo file into a .txt file if you are unsure on how to open a .nfo file (though you can always download &quot;DAMN nfo&quot; for free online).\n\nWill be seeding this forever, though my PC will not always be on so if the seeds die, just wait until a point in the day that I am actually online, it's not dead (though, I should count on you folks to seed, too)!\n\nOnto the Upload Details:\n\n\nBob Dylan\n\nDylan's Root(s)\n\nSource: East Orange &amp; Chapter Hall Tracks [1961] \n\nReleased: 1991\n\nAudio Type: FLAC\n\nQuality: Good to Average\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nEast Orange Recordings (February-March 1961):\n1.

The english page can be seen here (http://www.bobsboots.com/CDs/d-41i.jpg).\nThe CD itself is silk-screened with the image on the front of the booklet. Highly recommended. \t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:523c280f67b6eedc8be5d4a4aeb6580822cc7aaa","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Dylan%5C%27s+Roots+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Rare+Bootleg+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"523c280f67b6eedc8be5d4a4aeb6580822cc7aaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,60,40,15,103,182,238,220,139,229,212,164,174,182,88,8,34,204,122,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
