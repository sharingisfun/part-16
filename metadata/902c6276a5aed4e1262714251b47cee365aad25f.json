That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh! Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and M.C. Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC super-heroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heroes are Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and among many others. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will be some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c. 925gb in total. It will take as long as it takes, but it's nearly done. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n\n=================================\n\nProjected remaining torrents start and stop letters and approximate size\n\n 14gb 51 Won - Wonder Woman, Wonder Girl\n 16gb 52 Woo-Wz\n 14gb 53 X-Z\n 19gb 54 Fill Torent a-c\n 17gb 55 Fill Torent d-j\n 17gb 56 Fill Torent k-z\n\n=================================\nFifty We have Fifty! From 14 May, 2011 up to now, I have uploaded  817.31gb + today = 830.5  I'm expecting reductions to the fill torrent folders, but taking the last six torrents folders as they stand now, that's 97gb to go.\n\nGrand total  c.928gb\n =================================\nSo why is fifty anything to brag about? Why is this the golden anniversary for a married couple? The romans used the Letter L for fifty. I know the ancient Greeks and Israelites both used letters for their numbers too. I'm sure  a lot of people did the same. I don't know if anyone invented separate numbers with a positional value system before the Arab scholars invented arabic numerals  and the ever important concept of zero.  But they didn't start counting at zero. To this day no one says &quot;0 comics, 1 comic, 2 comics&quot;. Because it's stupid. Nobody much used it for ordinal numbers either. Because it leads to things like &quot;Taking the lead at the last moment for zeroeth place, we have Superman,  with Flash coming up for strong first place finish.  or  &quot;Darling, love of my life, I want you to know you'll always be zero in my heart&quot;    and   &quot;We're number zero, we're number zero!&quot;  \n\nUntil, that is, DC did their &quot;Zero Month&quot; in 1994. They may not have been the first time, but I think they popularized using zero as a comic book number. Since then many series have simply started with zero instead of one. Others have imitated DC by sticking one that is zero in at random. Think of it .how can one comic be zero?!? If one is zero all of mathematics is worth zero! There are of course the other horrors. The Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ issues - but you pay full price, of course. Marvel's  -1 issues. So when you buy them you have to give the shop a comic?? The there's Marvel's use of roman numerals for a volume number while simultaneously using the Arabic for a different series of the same name. Apparently they were unaware that the set of integers (and for that matter titles) is infinite  and thought they should conserve. What DC did was especially evil because those zero issues did not come before issue one. This blows the whole concept of ordinal number to hell, and with it everything ever counted (hold your cheers). I'm surprised accountants didn't commit mass suicide. Or maybe they did. Who would miss them? Don't kid yourself accountants. You know the real reason noone ever asks you how work is going, not even your Mom. You know why you are not invited to parties unless you have the party yourself, and invite clients, not friends. That way you can deduct it as a promotional expense. And become the Key Master, so the Gate Keeper will let you insert your key and unlock her gate. Sigourney Weaver  quite hot in her  Gate Keeper role in Ghostbusters, don't forget. This is the only way you can get someone like her, so start planning that party now. And learn what a cougar looks like. Both kinds. You do not  want to be confused about this like the original Key Master.\n\nWhat, what, WHAT does this have to do with fifty being golden? I don't know  - but I didn't know the answer to that original question so I wandered off to look at some shiny thing, like I always do..  Well I do know how golden got associated with fifty, or at least the common story is germanic folks long ago started giving golden wreaths/necklaces or the like on fiftieth wedding anniversaries. But that doesn't explain why 50 is special in the first place. I mean zeroeth place.\n\n=================================\nOne of the surprising things to me when I rediscovered comics after decades of abstinence was the existence of swimsuit issues, such as the Wildstorm ones included today. I was also surprised how much superhero uniforms of women had shrunk, while their breasts in many cases had moved into a realm as fantastic and fantasy derived as super-heroes themselves. Not that there's anything wrong with that. I did show one of the covers with four exceptionally super-powered mammary glands to my wife (from a  DC else-worlds with Superwoman Batwoman I believe), and she burst out laughing. She doesn't do that often. Might mean this art could be taken too far, but who could take a crazy idea like that seriously?\n\n Me personally, I'd rather go with photographs of the real thing (go - know I mean, eh? know what I mean - nudge nudge), but there is a lot to be said for &quot;good girl art&quot;. If you are not familiar with that comic's world phrase - good goes with art, not girl. But not as in &quot;good art, girl&quot; because unless you are talking to your dog or your horse, the artist might not appreciate being called &quot;girl&quot; . Your dog and horse probably cannot draw or paint so you won't have much use for that phrase. There are elephants who can paint. I'm not making this up! (thank you Dave Berry for the use of the catch phrase) So go find a painting elephant cow if you're dying to try out this phrase. But unless you live near Toledo, Ohio ( by near I mean  in the western hemisphere),  your nearest painting elephant may speak Thai, Sri Lankan or Cambodian. Those may not be real language names and if they are, the elephants still might speak a different indigenous tongue (elephant tongues are big so they might speak several at once). For example in thailand &quot;Hog badger&quot; or Bumble Bee Bat. are known to some of the locals. Even longtime Toledo resident and pachyderm-amercan Renee, who was one of the original members of the &quot;Grey School Movement&quot; in modern art c.1995,  is probably an immigrant and may have limited english vocabulary even now. She doesn't get out  much. So speak slowly and loudly. Speaking very loudly is a very long established method of helping non-english speakers understand you. It should work exceptionally well with Renee who is a rare African painting elephant, and thus has much larger ears than the more common Asian Painting Elephant.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.elephantart.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.elephantart.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy the way, a common mistake you want to avoid as an animal art novice is to confuse the &quot;Grey School Movement&quot;  in elephant art with the &quot;Grade School Movement&quot;  of children's art (c. A long Time Ago, in a (probably) Middle Eastern country far, far away).  Much of the confusion likely stems from the fact that Elephant art, while more expensive to buy than a typical children's finger painting, may well be indistinguishable to the laymen from &quot;Something my kid could do&quot;. All I can say is when your kid can paint by holding a paintbrush in his nose,  we'll talk. Jamming the handle up a nostril does not count. It's also generally not a sign of artistic ability. In a grade school kid, it's generally not a good sign at all. It may be a sign your wife has been cheating on you with Homer Simpson.\n=================================\n\nI think the Simpsons ratings would go up if Marge and Mrs Krabappel  made  clothing and body changes similar to what the SuperBabes have done since the comics of my youth. But not the elephants. Lord you don't wanna see that on an elephant.\n\n=================================\n\nToday's offering: DC from Wh-Wom\n\nEnjoy!\n\nWhere in the World Is Carmen Sandiego 01-04 (1996-1997)\nWhite Lama 01-06 (Humanoids(2000)\nWhite Lama v1 TPB-Reincarnation 145p (2004)\nWhite Lama v2 TPB-Road to Redemption (Double pages) 82p (2004)\nWhite Lama v2 TPB-Road to Redemption 159p (2004)\n\n\nWhiz Comics\n     Whiz Comics 001-155 (1940-1953)\n     Whiz Comics 002-Millennium Edition)\n     Whiz Comics 029-B&amp;W (R)(Australian) (alt)\n     Whiz Comics 120-original art 11p\n     Whiz Comics 122 (Canadian(06-1950)\n\n\nIn reality the official titles of some of these &quot;Who's Whos&quot; in the indicia does not start with &quot;Who&quot; but I didn't notice till I got to them and checked, and this is where most people will expect them anyway.\n\nWho's Who\n     Who's Who in Star Trek 01-02 (1987)\n     Who's Who in The !mpact Universe Phase 2 (Model sheets)\n     Who's Who in the !mpact Universe 01-03 (1992)\n     Who's Who in the DC Universe 01-16 (1990-1992)\n     Who's Who in the DC Universe Update 1993 01-02 (1992-1993)\n     Who's Who in the Legion of Super-Heroes 01-07 (1988)\n\n     Who's Who-Completist's Who's Who in the DC Universe-Fan produced 01-24 A-Z (08-2006 - Release date) - this one is a remix of who's who pages from different sources with some actual fan written material included where needed.

I assume the mini was very successful so they decided to do more, but why they didn't just start volume 2, I don't know.  Volume numbers are a complete mess anyway. Despite this one being called &quot;WildC.A.T.S.-Covert Action Teams&quot; in the indicia, and the DC-Wildstorm monthly being called simply &quot;WildC.A.T.S.&quot; the DC is usually called v2. Most people probably don't know or care what the indica of v1 says. Sometimes it's not worth going your own way on things, so I stuck with the traditional volume numbering even though it's clearly inspired by Satan-Squared. I care nothing for Satan's numbers much less his older, less hip relative's numbers. The nothing I care squared is nothing so you can see that once again zero is ruining my life.\n\n     WildC.A.T.S.-Covert Action Teams 01-04 (billed as a mini) (1992-1993)\n     WildC.A.T.S.-Covert Action Teams v1 00, 05-50 (1992-1998)\n     WildC.A.T.S.-Spawn 01-04 (1996)\n     WildC.A.T.S.-X-Men (1997-1998)\n     WildC.A.T.S.-X-Men TPB 189p (1998)\n     WildC.A.T.S.-X-Men-The Dark Age\n     WildC.A.T.S.-X-Men-The Golden Age\n     WildC.A.T.S.-X-Men-The Modern Age (08-1997)\n     WildC.A.T.S.-X-Men-The Silver Age 001 (1997)\n\nWildC.A.T.S. 1999-20xx DC\n     WildC.A.T.S.
