The book focuses on the meaning of the major works and innovations. It features nearly 600 illustrations (approximately half in color) representing art since 1940, both in Europe and America. It explores the full range of periods, artists, and movements: New York in the Forties; Calder, Hofmann, Gorky, Motherwell, De Kooning; Existentialism (Pollock, Newman, Rothko, David Smith); The New European Masters of the Late Forties (Dubuffet, Giacometti, Bacon), plus so much more. For anyone interested in Postwar Art.\n\nPS. Text is OCR-ed but of average quality. Illustrations are OK. But this is important and very informative book on Artists you may never heard off - and relative rare book in comparison on books about classic or famous artists..\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b72f53632055c48e0bd1066b276a437aac07495","amp;dn":"Art+Since+1940+-+Strategies+of+being+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b72f53632055c48e0bd1066b276a437aac07495","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,114,245,54,50,5,92,72,224,189,16,102,178,118,164,55,170,192,116,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
