You have to use a 32bit OS for it to correctly interface and recover the Media Smart Server. After it is recovered, do all the system downloads and then you will be able to use a 64bit OS to access the server.\n\n\nAnyone needing help with the Media Smart Server can get it at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mediasmartserver.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mediasmartserver.net/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThey are a great community of Media Smart users.\n\n\nThanks to all and if this helps you, please seed for others!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5a3f8fe1d018cad67015a15207cae93f92e866e","amp;dn":"HPMSSRecovery","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5a3f8fe1d018cad67015a15207cae93f92e866e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,163,248,254,29,1,140,173,103,1,90,21,32,124,174,147,249,46,134,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
