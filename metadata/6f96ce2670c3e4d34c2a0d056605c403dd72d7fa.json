What do they do all day? How did they know which career path to follow? What training and education do they have? Do they like their jobs? These questions are important because you will one day enter the world of work. Exploring Careers helps you answer the questions above, learn more about the jobs that interest you, and perhaps even decide on a career. Deciding on a career is like climbing a ladder: Take it one rung at a time, and you will steadily and surely get to your goal. Skip a rung or two, and you may feel shaky and unsure about reaching the top.
