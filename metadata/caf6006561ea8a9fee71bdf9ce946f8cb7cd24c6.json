The Western Pacific was a late comer to Americaâ€™s railroad scene â€“ WP was not incorporated to build its main line from Salt Lake City to the San Francisco Bay Area until 1903, and its final spike was not driven until 1909. As a result, the Western Pacific was constructed to exceptional engineering standards that featured numerous high trestles, bridges, and tunnels, and a routing that topped the rugged Sierra Nevada Mountains with an eastbound ruling grade of 1 percent.\r\n\r\nTrain Simulatorâ€™s Feather River Canyon route recreates the dramatic Western Pacific main line from Oroville to Quincy Junction, California, as it existed in the late 1960s and early 1970s and the route also includes a segment of the Inside Gateway (Western Pacificâ€™s important connection with the Great Northern and later Burlington Northern) from Keddie to Crescent Mills, as well as the trackage of the lumber-hauling Quincy Railroad short line. \r\n\r\nThe route brings to life the remarkable locations and features of the Feather River Canyon, including famous Keddie Wye and Spanish Creek trestle, bustling Oroville yard and roundhouse, the iconic rail and road bridges of Pulga, and the nearly countless tunnels, such as the â€œHoneymoon Tunnelsâ€ near Belden, that Western Pacificâ€™s visionary builders used to form the WP into a railroad engineering marvel. \r\n\r\nIncluded with the Feather River route are General Electric U30B and EMD F7 diesels in Western Pacificâ€™s flashy orange and silvery livery and a selection of period-authentic freight rolling stock including a Western Pacific bay-window caboose. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScenarios \r\n\r\nSeven career scenarios and eight railfan scenarios are included for the route: \r\n\r\nKeddie Consignment: Part 1 \r\nKeddie Consignment: Part 2 \r\nKeddie Consignment: Part 3 \r\nCrescent Mills to Keddie \r\nOroville Bound: Part 1 \r\nOroville Bound: Part 2 \r\nOroville Bound: Part 3 \r\nPlus 8 railfan scenarios\r\n\r\n\r\nKey Features \r\nWestern Pacificâ€™s fabulous Feather River Canyon route from Oroville to Quincy Jct., California, including a segment of the Inside Gateway and the Quincy RR short line \r\nGeneral Electric U30B diesel in WP orange and silver livery \r\nElectro-Motive F7A and F7B diesels in Western Pacific livery \r\nPeriod-authentic freight rolling stock including a WP bay-window caboose \r\nScenarios for the route \r\nQuick Drive compatible","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caf6006561ea8a9fee71bdf9ce946f8cb7cd24c6","amp;dn":"RailWorks+-+Feather+River+Canyon+Route+AddOn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caf6006561ea8a9fee71bdf9ce946f8cb7cd24c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,246,0,101,97,234,138,159,238,113,189,249,206,148,111,140,183,205,36,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
