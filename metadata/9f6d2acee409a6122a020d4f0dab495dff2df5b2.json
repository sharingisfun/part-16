At further inspection there is much to it.\nConsider how easy it could be disproved: Take a few snapshots off a satellite that is near each pole (or hole, for that matter), and let those snapshots clearly show the icecaps on the poles without cloud-cover. \nThis should be as easy as - say - taking snapshozs from the stars when on the moon (the equipment for that purpose would weigh considerably less than a totally unnecessary moonrover, which they took purportedly to the moon), such pictures would have proven once and for all the authenticity of the manned moon-landings, for they could not have been faked on earth - but that is another story.\nAnyway, until proven wrong by said photographs I will adher to this theory.\n\ncontents:\n\nfolders:\n1829 Olaf Jansen - the smoky god\n1896 ETIDORHPA\n1897-Nansen-FarthestNorth\n1906 William Reed - THE PHANTOM OF THE POLES\n1920 Marshall B.
