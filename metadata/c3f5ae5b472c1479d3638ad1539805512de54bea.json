It even distresses me more that somebody might try pull this off as a Hoax to try to create some kind of false reality concerning the Need for Banning guns in America. This whole thing could be a Hoax or Partial Hoax. Funny how NO ambulances were ever seen or photographed leaving the School for Any Hospitals. Also Adam Lanza hasn't been seen or heard of for over 3 years and The Dead Shooter body who ever it may be was reported to have been at least 24 hours before the shooting and who was the guy they caught running through the forest and how come the Rifle he possibly used was found outside the School and he was killed inside the School. Just a few things that come to mind. To me this is just another 911 deception. But you decide.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3f5ae5b472c1479d3638ad1539805512de54bea","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Conspiracy+-+020+-+The+Sandy+Hook+School+Shooting+Hoax+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3f5ae5b472c1479d3638ad1539805512de54bea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,245,174,91,71,44,20,121,211,99,138,209,83,152,5,81,45,229,75,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
