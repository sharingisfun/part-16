This is AT40, I'm Casey Kasem, and the countdown rolls on.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nCasey plays part of a song that sold a million copies 9 years before it appeared on the hot 100. The man who sang it hit the chart more times than anybody else, except Elvis Presley.\n\nA listener wants to know, &quot;Who is the all-time top British solo artist?&quot; This artist has hit the top 40 seventeen times, had 13 top ten hits, and 5 number one songs as of this countdown.\n\nThere is a song by the first act on the legendary Motown label ever to sell a million singles (and Casey plays the song that did it as an extra).\n\nCasey tells of Johnny Mercer, a man who wrote the lyrics for more than a thousand published songs; songs that have won him 2 Grammys, 4 Oscars, and 15 Oscar nominations. There is a disco version of one of his songs in this countdown.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;In what year did the most British acts hit number 1 on the American charts.&quot; He says it was the only year when the British acts held the top spot more weeks than the Americans did.\n\n40: Bop - Ohio Players\n39: Lorali - Styx\n38: He's A Friend - Eddie Kendricks\n37: Livin' For The Weekend - OJ's\n36: I Do I Do I Do I Do I Do - ABBA\n35: You Lose A Good Thing - Freddie Fender\n34: Lookin' For Space - John Denver\n33: Love Fire - Jigsaw\n32: Inseparable - Natalie Cole\n31: Slow Ride - Foghat\n30: Only Love Is Real - Carole King\n29: 50 Ways To Leave Your Lover - Paul Simon\n28: Theme From &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; - Rhythm Heritage\n27: Love Hurts - Nazareth\nEXTRA: Shop Around - The Miracles\n26: Good Hearted Woman - Waylon Jennings &amp; Willie Nelson\n25: Boogie Fever - The Sylvers\n24: There's A Kind Of Hush - Herman's Hermits\n23: Action - Sweet\n22: Cupid - Tony Orlando &amp; Dawn\n21: Love Machine - The Miracles\n20: Junk Food Junkie - Larry Gross\n19: Tangerine - The Salsoul Orchestra\n18: Show Me The Way - Peter Frampton\n17: Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen\n16: Take It To The Limit - The Eagles\n15: Sweet Love - The Commodores\n14: Deep Purple - Donny &amp; Marie Osmond\n13: Only Sixteen - Dr. Hook\n12: Fanny Be Tender With My Love - The Bee Gees\n11: Golden Years - David Bowie\nExtra: I Am, I Said - Neil Diamond\n10: Money Honey - Bay City Rollers\n9: Right Back Where We Started From - Maxine Nightengale\n8: Let Your Love Flow - The Bellamy Brothers\n7: Dream On - Aerosmith\n6: Sweet Thing - Rufus Featuring/ Chakakahn\n5: Disco Lady - Johnny Taylor\n4: All By Myself - Eric Carmen\n3: Lonely Night - The Captain and Tennille\n2: Dream Weaver - Gary Wright\n1: December 1963 - The Four Seasons\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33a3e83dbaa3ad8c2a24e048aa0254f905094ab1","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1976_March_27th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33a3e83dbaa3ad8c2a24e048aa0254f905094ab1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,163,232,61,186,163,173,140,42,36,224,72,170,2,84,249,5,9,74,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
