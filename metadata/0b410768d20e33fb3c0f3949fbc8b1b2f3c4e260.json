The track features AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© 3000 of OutKast and is &quot;narrated&quot; by Lil' Wayne. Lyrically, the song is about a girl who had an affair while Lloyd was on vacation. It was released on August 9, 2011.\n\nThe clean and radio versions replace the word &quot;pussy&quot; with &quot;lovin'&quot;. (e.g. I miss that lovin', that lovin', that lovin', that lovin'). Some critics, including Rolling Stone, compared the song to Cee-Lo Green's &quot;Fuck You&quot; and praised the song's energy, production, singing, song-writing, and profanity.\n\nSeed and enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b410768d20e33fb3c0f3949fbc8b1b2f3c4e260","amp;dn":"Dedication+To+My+Ex+%28Clean%29+-+Lloyd+ft.+Andre+3000+256Kbps+iTune","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b410768d20e33fb3c0f3949fbc8b1b2f3c4e260","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,65,7,104,210,14,51,251,60,15,57,73,251,200,177,178,243,196,226,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
