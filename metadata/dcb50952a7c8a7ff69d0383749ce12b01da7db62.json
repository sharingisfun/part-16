As Gogol's wily antihero, Chichikov, combs the back country wheeling and dealing for &quot;dead souls&quot;--deceased serfs who still represent money to anyone sharp enough to trade in them--we are introduced to a Dickensian cast of peasants, landowners, and conniving petty officials, few of whom can resist the seductive illogic of Chichikov's proposition.
