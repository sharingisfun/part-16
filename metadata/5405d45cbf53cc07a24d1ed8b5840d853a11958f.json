HyperCam supports text annotations, sound, and screen notes (great for creating automated software demos!). You can also select Frame rate and compression quality prior to video capture. This format can be played under Windows, as well as the Internet, unlike other programs that use proprietary formats that may need special viewers and be difficult, if not impossible, to edit.\n\nHyperCam captures the action from your Windows screen and saves it to AVI (Audio-Video Interleaved) movie file. Sound from your system microphone is also recorded. Please note that HyperCam is not intended for re-recording of other video clips from the screen (e.g. playing in Media Player, RealVideo, QuickTime etc.), but rather for creating regular software presentations, tutorial, demos etc.\n\nFeatures include:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ New in ver. 6 TextSnapÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ feature to capture editable text from almost anywhere on the screen, when running under Windows 2000, XP, Vista or newer.
