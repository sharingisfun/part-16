He was encouraged by Dominic Aitchison, and their ideas would lay the backbone for Crippled Black Phoenix.\n\nAlthough originally having an unorthodox start, since all the band members were part of and busy with other projects at the time of the band's founding, Crippled Black Phoenix remained committed to staying together and forged their sound. The band writes what they call &quot;endtime ballads,&quot; signifying both the slightly macabre nature of their songs and their unusual blend of styles as the final evolution in music. This blend has led to them being called everything from stoner-prog to freak-folk to doom.\n\nCrippled Black Phoenix have made live shows a focus and have performed in unusual venues, using Victorian-era instruments in tandem with more modern instruments.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Troublemaker\n02.We Forgotten Who We Are\n03.Fantastic Justice\n04.Bastogne Blues\n05.Of A Lifetime\n06.Burning Bridges\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c03448c5383865d3675db543c985f01da31784ae","amp;dn":"Crippled+Black+Phoenix+-+I%2C+Vigilante+%282010%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c03448c5383865d3675db543c985f01da31784ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,52,72,197,56,56,101,211,103,93,181,67,201,133,240,29,163,23,132,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
