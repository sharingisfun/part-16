Stone\nRichard Eyer\nPhilip Abbott\nDiane Brewster\nRobby the Robot\nRobert H. Harris\n\nThough Richard Eyer and Philip Abbott get top billing, the real star of The Invisible Boy is Robby the Robot of Forbidden Planet fame. Based on a short story by Edmund Cooper (which, incidentally, contained no robots!), the film finds electronics genius Dr. Merrinoe (Abbott) developing a huge talking computer. While Merrinoe is the master of his laboratory, he has trouble controlling his rambunctious son Timmie (Eyer). When the doctor takes Timmie to the lab with him, hoping to impress his son with the importance of his work, Timmie is interested only in reassembling a robot left behind by Merrinoe's predecessor. \n\nThough the robot has been programmed not to bring harm to human beings, the poor clunking creature falls under the spell of Merrinoe's &quot;super computer,&quot; which has developed a demonic mind of its own. The computer arranges to launch a rocket, with the robot at the controls, that will enable it to control the earth's orbit. But Timmie, who has stowed away on board the rocket, is able to bring the robot to its &quot;senses&quot; and save the day. \n\nImpressive on a technical level, The Invisible Boy is relentlessly silly storywise, which of course adds to the enjoyment. Best line: &quot;Timmie, if you don't bring that rocketship back this instant, you'll get the spanking of your life!&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcf7a3eac4509c5a4e8593012395f5b29a18a7ab","amp;dn":"The+Invisible+Boy+%28SF%2C+1957%29+-+with+Robby+the+Robot.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcf7a3eac4509c5a4e8593012395f5b29a18a7ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,247,163,234,196,80,156,90,78,133,147,1,35,149,245,178,154,24,167,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
