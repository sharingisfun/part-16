Tamar is a talented singer but a very quiet and insecure girl who comes to Jerusalem in search of her brother. She has left everyone behind including her family, and has a makeover by buzzing her hair to become unrecognizable. Tamar makes ends meet by playing guitar and singing in the streets. Her impromptu performances attract the attention of Pesach, who claims to look after the city's sidewalk performers but in truth is a criminal. On the other hand, Asaf is a 17-year-old boy who is working at a boring summer job at City Hall. Asaf is clumsy, naÃ¯ve, and a very shy boy. One day he is assigned the job of finding the owners of an uncontrollable stray dog so that the owners may be fined. Unsure where to start, Asaf decides to follow the lead of the dog. Thus he is led to various people and parts of the city and combining the clues he gets from them, Asaf learns that the dog belongs to Tamar.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 716x574, 25.000 fps, 2449 Kbps, 01h56m36s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, 6 channel, 384 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, Hebrew audio\r\n\r\nOptional subtitles Bulgarian, English, Hebrew, Russian, Spanish\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/6a8o8f8bb/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/ljtimtwpb/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/5vsbg1h3j/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/w2tibzzdb/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/z8e427hzj/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cc45ee0e1ed6032def16a57fa77af5740380ccc","amp;dn":"Someone+to+Run+With+-+Mishehu+Larutz+Ito+%5B2006+-+Israel%5D+drama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cc45ee0e1ed6032def16a57fa77af5740380ccc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,196,94,224,225,237,96,50,222,241,106,87,250,119,175,87,64,56,12,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
