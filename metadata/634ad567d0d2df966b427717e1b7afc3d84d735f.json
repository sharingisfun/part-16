The case seems routine a dispute over an unpaid marriage dowry but it opens an unexpected window into the dramatists famously obscure life. Using the court testimony as a springboard, acclaimed nonfiction writer Charles Nicholl examines this fascinating period in Shakespeare's life. With evidence from a wide variety of sources, Nicholl creates a compelling, detailed account of the circumstances in which Shakespeare lived and worked during the time in which he wrote such plays as Othello, Measure for Measure, and King Lear . The case also throws new light on the puzzling story of Shakespeare's collaboration with the hack author and violent brothel owner George Wilkins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:634ad567d0d2df966b427717e1b7afc3d84d735f","amp;dn":"The+Lodger+Shakespeare+by+Charles+Nicholl+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"634ad567d0d2df966b427717e1b7afc3d84d735f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,74,213,103,208,210,223,150,107,66,119,23,225,183,175,195,216,77,115,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
