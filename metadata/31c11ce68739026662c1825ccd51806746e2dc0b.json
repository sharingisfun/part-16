Former Miles Davis sidemen Tony Williams and Ron Carter also add an organic touch to the proceedings and a warm contrast to the electric pianos and Moogs that flow through Don Sebesky's arrangements. Alternate takes of the title track and others including &quot;I'm Getting Sentimental Over You/You've Changed,&quot; &quot;The Best Thing for You,&quot; and &quot;If You Could See Me Now&quot; make this double-disc set a more complete look at one of Baker's most important latter-day albums.
