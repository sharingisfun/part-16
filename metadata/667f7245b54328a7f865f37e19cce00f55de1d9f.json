The program looked at how buccaneer capitalists were allowed to shape the climate of the Thatcher years, focusing on the rise of Colonel David Stirling, Jim Slater, James Goldsmith, and Tiny Rowland, all members of The Clermont club in the 1960s. It received the BAFTA Award for Best Factual Series or Strand in 2000.\n\nEpisode List:\nEpisode 1 - Who Pays Wins\nEpisode 2 - Entrepreneur Spelt S.P.I.V.\nEpisode 3 - Destroy the Technostructure\nEpisode 4 - The Twilight of the Dogs\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mayfair_Set&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mayfair_Set&lt;/a&gt;\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\n2002 - THE CENTURY OF THE SELF\n\n\n\n&quot;This series is about how those in power have used Freud&amp;#039;s theories to try and control the dangerous crowd in an age of mass democracy.&quot; - Adam Curtis\n\nSigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, changed the perception of the human mind and its workings profoundly. His influence on the 20th century is widely regarded as massive. The documentary describes the impact of Freud&amp;#039;s theories on the perception of the human mind, and the ways public relations agencies and politicians have used this during the last 100 years for their &quot;engineering of consent&quot;.The Century of the Self asks deeper questions about the roots and methods of modern consumerism, representative democracy and its implications. It also questions the modern way we see ourselves, the attitude to fashion and superficiality.\n\nThe business and, increasingly, the political world uses PR to read and fulfill our desires, to make their products or speeches as pleasing as possible to us. Curtis raises the question of the intentions and roots of this fact. Where once the political process was about engaging people&amp;#039;s rational, concious minds, as well as facilitating their needs as a society, the documentary shows how by employing the tactics of psychoanalysis, politicians appeal to irrational, primitive impulses that have little apparent bearing on issues outside of the narrow self-interest of a consumer population.\n\nEpisode List:\nEpisode 1 - Happiness Machines\nEpisode 2 - The Engineering of Consent\nEpisode 3 - There is a Policeman Inside All Our Heads: He Must Be Destroyed\nEpisode 4 - Eight People Sipping Wine in Kettering\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Century_Of_The_Self&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Century_Of_The_Self&lt;/a&gt;\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\n2004 - THE POWER OF NIGHTMARES (The Rise of the Politics of Fear)\n\n\n\nThe series consists of three one-hour films, consisting mostly of a montage of archive footage with Curtis&amp;#039;s narration, which were first broadcast in the United Kingdom in late 2004 and have been subsequently aired in multiple countries and shown in several film festivals, including the 2005 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe films compare the rise of the American Neo-Conservative movement and the radical Islamist movement, making comparisons on their origins and noting strong similarities between the two. More controversially, it argues that the threat of radical Islamism as a massive, sinister organised force of destruction, specifically in the form of al-Qaeda, is in fact a myth perpetrated by politicians in many countriesÃƒÂ¢??and particularly American Neo-ConservativesÃƒÂ¢??in an attempt to unite and inspire their people following the failure of earlier, more utopian ideologies.\n\nThe Power of Nightmares has been praised by film critics in both Britain and the United States. Its message and content have also been the subject of various critiques and criticisms from conservatives and progressives.\n\nEpisode List:\nPart 1 - Baby It&amp;#039;s Cold Outside\nPart 2 - The Phantom Victory\nPart 3 - The Shadows in the Cave\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_Nightmares&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_Nightmares&lt;/a&gt;\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\n2007 - THE TRAP (What Happened to Our Dream of Freedom?)\n\n\n\nThe Trap: What Happened to Our Dream of Freedom is a BBC documentary series by British filmmaker Adam Curtis, well known for other documentaries including The Century of the Self and The Power of Nightmares. It began airing on BBC Two on 11 March 2007.\n\nThe series consists of three, one-hour programmes which explore the concept and definition of freedom, specifically &quot;how a simplistic model of human beings as self-seeking, almost robotic, creatures led to today&amp;#039;s idea of freedom.&quot;\n\nEpisode List:\nPart 1 - Fuck You Buddy\nPart 2 - The Lonely Robot\nPart 3 - We Will Force You to be Free\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trap_%28television_documentary_series%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trap_%28television_documentary_series%29&lt;/a&gt;\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\nRAFFLES - A Gentleman Thief... Robbing knowldge from the rich and giving it to the poor.\n\n\n\nAlso,\n\nPersonally I have been desparately looking for a great Paul Newman film called &quot;HARPER&quot; from 1966. It was called &quot;The Moving Target&quot; in the UK. I&amp;#039;ve been looking for it for years! I only managed to get an ed2K copy but that was in Spanish. So if anyone has a copy of it IN ENGLISH:\nPlease Please Please!!!
