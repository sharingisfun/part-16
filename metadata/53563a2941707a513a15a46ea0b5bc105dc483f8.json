For the next 10 years as millions of kids discovered the joy of these miniature marvels, one small characteristic came to define this radical die-cast era: the thin red line on the cars tires. Hot Wheels Classics: The Redline Era proudly showcases more than 500 spectacular color photos (so come of the finest cars of this groundbreaking time.) Sprinkled throughout the visual and historical feast, you'll enjoy the commentary from legendary car designer Larry Wood and other Mattel designers. More than 40 years of introduction, Hot Wheels cars have experienced a multitude of changes, incredible success, trials and tribulations, and ultimately crafted one of the greatest American toy stories of all time. Yet is one single feature from decades past that skill defines for many their greatest: the Redline.\n\n\n\nBy Angelo Von Bogart\nPublished by Krause Publications in 2011\nEPUB, Retail, 224 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53563a2941707a513a15a46ea0b5bc105dc483f8","amp;dn":"Hot+Wheels+Classics+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53563a2941707a513a15a46ea0b5bc105dc483f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,86,58,41,65,112,122,81,58,21,164,110,160,181,188,16,93,196,131,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
