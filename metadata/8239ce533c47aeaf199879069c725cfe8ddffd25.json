The scientist and philosopher...the greedy moneylender and middle man...the impoverished immigrant...the elite of politics and finance...the prophet...the revolutionary. All of these have been faces of the Jewish people over the centuries. They have inspired admiration, envy, suspicion, and hatred and overflowed with world-changing personages. The historian Yuri Slezkine claimed that the 20th century was nothing less than the Jewish century, so indispensable were Jews to the creation of the modern world.\n\nWith The Chosen People, Richard Lynn undertakes a systematic inquiry into the general intelligence of Jews worldwide. Calling upon history as well as the latest advances in genetic analysis and evolutionary theory, Lynn demonstrates that in the past 250 years, high IQ has been the foundation of Jewish influence, success, and power. This study is integrated with concise narratives of the Jewish experience in various countries and regions, as well as a discussion of the cultural and genetic divisions within the Jewish ethos. The Chosen People will be valued by historians, evolutionary scientists, and anyone who wants to understand more fully this remarkable people.\n\n408 pages\nPublisher: Washington Summit Publishers; 1st edition (September 5, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1593680368\nISBN-13: 978-1593680367","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8239ce533c47aeaf199879069c725cfe8ddffd25","amp;dn":"The+Chosen+People+%282011%29+by+Richard+Lynn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8239ce533c47aeaf199879069c725cfe8ddffd25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,57,206,83,60,71,174,175,25,152,121,6,156,114,92,254,141,223,253,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
