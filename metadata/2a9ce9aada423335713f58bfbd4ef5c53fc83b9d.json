The episode was not strictly taped as a live episode there however, but was prefaced by an introduction by O'Brien taped in New York. The Finland episode came as the culmination of a long running joke on the show. Earlier in the season, Conan had been informed by some Finnish audience members that he bore a resemblance to their (female) president Tarja Halonen, who was running for re-election. Conan subsequently made a running joke of the resemblance, often putting a picture of Halonen side by side with his own face. Conan's interest in the joke increased when he discovered that Late Night was quite popular in Finland, and that his running joke had made its way into actual news commentary about the Finnish election. After this discovery, Conan began making satirical commercials in support of Halonen and vowed to travel to Finland to meet her if she won re-election. When she did indeed win re-election in January 2006, Conan traveled to Finland and met with Halonen as well.\n\n\nVIDEO:\nLength\n41 mins 28 seconds\nResolution\n704 x 576\nAspect ratio\n16:9 letterboxed\nFormat\nXVID\nBitrate\n870 kbps\nFrames per second\n25.000\nSelected codec\nffodivx\n\nAUDIO:\nFormat\n85\nBitrate\n128 kbps\nRate\n48000 Hz\nChannels\n2\nSelected codec\nmp3\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a9ce9aada423335713f58bfbd4ef5c53fc83b9d","amp;dn":"Conan.O.Brien.2006.03.10.Finland.Special.DSR.XviD-amis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a9ce9aada423335713f58bfbd4ef5c53fc83b9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,156,233,170,218,66,51,53,113,63,88,191,189,78,245,197,63,200,59,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
