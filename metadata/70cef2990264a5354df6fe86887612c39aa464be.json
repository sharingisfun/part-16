BananaScreen adds face recognition login to your webcam-enabled Windows computer. To use, just install BananaScreen and create a face model. \nThen set up BananaScreen to lock after a predefined amount of inactivity (or hit Alt-L to lock at any time). Once locked, BananaScreen will keep an eye on faces coming and going in front of the camera. When it matches yours, it immediately unlocks your computer. Pretty Cool \n \n \nNote : I have tested it on my own Laptop and it works perfectly 100% guaranteed! It will particularly recognize your eyes so don&amp;#039;t bother wearing any eyeglasses when using this stuff!
