The appropriate term for this constellation of behaviors is Ã¢â‚¬Å“reactivity.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ This book helps dog owners and trainers to understand the reactive dog and help him change for the better. \n\nThe process is easy to grasp, and once the changes begin to take shape, owners become so encouraged that improving their dog's behavior suddenly becomes fun and exciting! If your dog can't pay attention to you in public places, doesn't behave like a good member of the family when guests visit, and looses control when other dogs are nearby, this book has a lot to offer. \n\nAll training methods and classroom techniques are non-force and based on developing a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœworking relationshipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ with your dog. Easy to read and understand, 148 pages, with 68 photographs and graphics to help you improve behavior and solve problems. This 2009 edition includes more specific examples, and more and better photos to give you a better idea of what to look for and how to handle your reactive dog.\n\nYou will learn:\n\n- Easy to read and implement how-to book on fearful and reactive dogs\n- Many pictures to illustrate key points\n- Originally published in 2004, and revised and expanded in 2009\n- How to develop a simple program addressing the stimuli which causes fear\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction | Animals / Dogs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36231c2f13ff0b8d14c4bddc3d89507c0f15df4f","amp;dn":"Scaredy+Dog%21+Understanding+and+Rehabilitating...","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36231c2f13ff0b8d14c4bddc3d89507c0f15df4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,35,28,47,19,255,11,141,20,196,189,220,61,137,80,124,15,21,223,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
