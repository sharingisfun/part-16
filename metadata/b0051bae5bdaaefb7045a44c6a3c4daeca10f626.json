His first mystery, Canto for a Gypsy (1973) Ã¢â‚¬â€ featuring Roman Grey, a gypsy art dealer in New York City, New York Ã¢â‚¬â€ was nominated for an Edgar Award. Nightwing (1977), also an Edgar nominee, was his breakthrough novel, and he adapted it for a feature film of the same name (1979).\n\nHowever, he is best known for the 7 Arkady Renko novels uploaded in this torrent.
