As radio transceivers constitute the major bottleneck in a wireless chipset in terms of power consumption and die size, the radio must be designed in the context of the entire system, end to end. Therefore the book will address wireless systems as well as the DSP parts before it gets into coverage of radio design issues. To that end, the book contains three parts:\r\n\r\nPart 1: a general part discussing current and future wireless networks, chipset evolution over the past decade and ending with a discussion on radio requirements for software defined radio(SDR).\r\n\r\nPart 2: will focus on the digital baseband of a wireless chip set, flexible DSP cores for multi-standard wireless platforms and system-on-chip SoC implementation and design flow issues.\r\n\r\nPart 3: will be devoted to radio design issues starting at the transceiver level and going down to discuss critical issues facing design of future multi band multi standard radios for emerging wireless standards such as UMTS, WiMaX, MIMO and WLAN in a way that is consistent with the prevailing vision of SDR.\r\n\r\nAs such, the book is the first volume that looks at the integrated radio design problem as a &quot;piece of a big puzzle&quot;, namely the entire chipset or single chip that builds an entire wireless system. This is the only way to successfully design radios to meet the stringent demands of todayâ€™s increasingly complex wireless systems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79ef7846d1e98d79906c54691b89e4569f64dde5","amp;dn":"Radio+Design+in+Nanometenologies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79ef7846d1e98d79906c54691b89e4569f64dde5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,239,120,70,209,233,141,121,144,108,84,105,27,137,228,86,159,100,221,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
