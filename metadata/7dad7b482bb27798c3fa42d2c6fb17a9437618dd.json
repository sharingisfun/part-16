Mark Lewis (Cane Toads: An Unnatural History) explores one of Australia s greatest environmental catastrophes as he follows the unstoppable march of the cane toad across the Australian continent. Despised by many, venerated by some, the toad has occupied a nationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s consciousness achieving both cult and criminal status. Despite its international origin the cane toad has become uniquely Australian yet, for a world wrestling with the idea that we have irretrievably altered our own ecosystem, its story holds universal relevance. Featuring a host of engaging characters as well as thousands of toads, Cane Toads: The Conquest is a humorous yet thought-provoking journey into the issue of invasive species.\nReview\nFascinating...very ambitious...I can t think of a movie IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve seen [at Sundance] that was as enjoyable and unusual as Cane Toads --LA Times\n\nMichael Moore Meets Monty Python --Toronto Star\n\nHugely Enjoyable - **** (FOUR STARS) --The Metro\n\nHugely Enjoyable - **** (FOUR STARS) --The Metro\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1600 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.778:1\nVideo Resolution: 832x464 (16.9)\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 80mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.01 GB\nSource: DVD\nEncoded by: Harry65","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dad7b482bb27798c3fa42d2c6fb17a9437618dd","amp;dn":"Cane.Toads.The.Conquest.x264.AC3..mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dad7b482bb27798c3fa42d2c6fb17a9437618dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,173,123,72,43,178,119,152,195,250,66,210,198,251,23,169,67,118,24,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
