However, this contains the fixed version of 06. If you got stuck at 99.7% when downloading RummyKid's torrent with 05 and 06, now you can finally get 06! And just f.y.i. this series is not subtitled &quot;Where Were You,&quot; that's the first storyline.\n\n------\n\n\nFrom IDW:\n\nThe sizzling collaboration between IDW Publishing and HBO heats up again! Proving that there are helpings yet to be had in this buffet of twisted Southern hospitality called TRUE BLOOD, comics luminaries Ann Nocenti, Michael McMillian, and Michael Gaydos are joining forces with series creator Alan Ball to take readers on a brand-new ride through the supernatural underbelly of Bon Temps, Louisiana, in an all-new ongoing series beginning in May.\n\nIn Where Were You?, the series' first arc, readers will learn the beloved cast of charactersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roles in and reaction to the &quot;Great Revelation&quot;; the day when vampires revealed themselves to the world, which makes TRUE BLOOD the devilishly unique and dynamic series it is. Loved by fans and critics alike, TRUE BLOOD has become a force in both comics and television with a mythology sure to thrill and delight for years to come.\n\nRenowned artist Tim Bradstreet (Vampire: The Masquerade, Hellblazer) rounds out the team, providing striking covers for the series, which will also feature hugely popular photo covers for each issue.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a53601fe3fdf38383a898ab6b15133b737140366","amp;dn":"True+Blood+%282012+IDW+ongoing+series%29+01+to+07","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a53601fe3fdf38383a898ab6b15133b737140366","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,54,1,254,63,223,56,56,58,137,138,182,177,81,51,183,55,20,3,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
