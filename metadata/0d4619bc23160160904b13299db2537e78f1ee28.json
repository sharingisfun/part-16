It asks one simple question Ã¢â‚¬â€œ how will you die?\n\nIn the towns of Muldraugh and West Point, survivors must loot houses, build defences and do their utmost to delay their inevitable death day by day. No help is coming Ã¢â‚¬â€œ your continued survival relies on your own cunning, luck and ability to evade a relentless horde.\nCurrent Features\n\n    Hard-core Sandbox Zombie Survival Game with a focus on realistic survival.\n    Online multiplayer survival with persistent player run servers.\n    Full line of sight system and real-time lighting, sound and visibility mechanics.
