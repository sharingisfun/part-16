Blues From The Rain Forest\n2. Sunrise Over Haleakala\n3. Blue HIll Ocean Dance\n4. Afro Pearl Blue\n5. Dance Of The Fireflies\n6. Sri Lanka\n\n\nThis meditative record is a departure from the bluesier and funkier organ work for which Merl Saunders is best known. Experimenting with a number of synthesized sonic textures, Saunders establishes a peaceful mood that borders at times on New Age, but is anchored significantly by Jerry Garcia's guitar. Garcia (Grateful Dead) again shows his ability to be comfortable in a variety of musical settings, and his playing here is inventive and interesting without ever disturbing the mellow atmosphere. Saunders calls it &quot;environmental earth music&quot; and the sounds are both inspired by and in honor of the rainforest. A lovely record that offers ample rewards even without undivided attention.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9a91e3ca13f9e68f5f24d06b2190e1ef5cd7ccc","amp;dn":"Merl+Saunders+and+Jerry+Garcia+-+Blues+From+the+Rainforest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9a91e3ca13f9e68f5f24d06b2190e1ef5cd7ccc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,169,30,60,161,63,158,104,245,242,77,6,178,25,14,30,245,205,124,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
