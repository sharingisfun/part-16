Death, however, remains the proverbial elephant in the room--real and looming, but ignored. Death deserves more credit than it receives. Together with birth, death forms the container that shapes our lives. If we choose to acknowledge it, death offers a framework for examining life and living it more consciously, meaningfully, and lovingly.\n'#DEATHtweet Book01' seeks to disarm and demystify death, to expose its teachings, to guide us toward a life filled with purpose and meaning, allowing us to experience ourselves and our world in all its abundance.\n\nIn 140 bite-sized perspectives, Timothy Tosta--attorney, author, cancer survivor, and seasoned volunteer hospice worker--shares with us the lessons he has learned from his own encounters with death.\n\n'#DEATHtweet Book01' inspires us to see our life experience as an incredible gift, to approach every human interaction with awareness and generosity, and to find meaning, balance, and happiness in our lives.\n\nAbout the Author\n___\n\nTimothy Tosta is a cancer survivor, a seasoned hospice volunteer, and executive coach to the legal and business communities.
