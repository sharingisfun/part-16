When Britain entered the war, two-thirds of all Britain's food was imported - and now it was under threat from a Nazi blockade. To save Britain from starvation, the nation's farmers were tasked with doubling food production in what Churchill called 'the frontline of freedom'. This meant ploughing up 6.5 million acres of unused land - a combined area bigger than the whole of Wales.\nDue to audio problems with the last upload of this release , i have re-done it from the DVD , SO THIS IS A NEW UPLOAD\n\n\n\n4)  Part 4 \nThe team discovers that Wartime Farmers could lose everything - their home and their land - if the government did not think they were productive enough. Over 2,000 farmers deemed 'not good enough' were thrown off their farms during the war. Ruth, Peter and Alex face a World War Two-style government inspection, meeting an expert who tells them to grow and to get their milking operation up and running. In the process they confront the wave of mechanisation that government regulation brought to wartime farming, grappling with a new tractor and getting to grips with a milking machine. Yet they are dealt a bitter blow with the loss of a prime dairy cow. Peter also launches a rabbit-breeding concern and they take in the latest release from the Ministry of Information, who made films urging farmers to use the very latest techniques in the fields. The team also discovers the chilling story of a local farmer who lost his life in a dramatic shoot-out with the police after the authorities tried to remove him from his farm for failing to meet his required targets With their hard work completed the inspector returns to judge the state of the farm and award them their all-important official 'grade' - determining whether their efforts have been a success or a failure.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/1222/wartimefarmscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/1222/wartimefarmscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img259.imageshack.us/img259/4766/wartimefarmscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img259.imageshack.us/img259/4766/wartimefarmscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/3338/wartimefarmscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/3338/wartimefarmscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/6236/wartimefarmscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/6236/wartimefarmscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/2343/wartimefarmscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/2343/wartimefarmscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img132.imageshack.us/img132/2118/wartimefarmscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img132.imageshack.us/img132/2118/wartimefarmscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img209.imageshack.us/img209/5361/wartimefarmscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img209.imageshack.us/img209/5361/wartimefarmscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/9240/wartimefarmscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/9240/wartimefarmscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img717.imageshack.us/img717/2865/wartimefarmscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img717.imageshack.us/img717/2865/wartimefarmscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1578 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59mins\n * Number Of Parts: 8\n * Part Size: 745 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.wartimefarm.co.uk/the-farm-at-war/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.wartimefarm.co.uk/the-farm-at-war/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f31f1a6f66367757f084f5d1ae218fd0b9361a0","amp;dn":"BBC+Wartime+Farm+4of8+DVDrip+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f31f1a6f66367757f084f5d1ae218fd0b9361a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,49,241,166,246,99,103,117,127,8,79,93,26,226,24,253,11,147,97,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
