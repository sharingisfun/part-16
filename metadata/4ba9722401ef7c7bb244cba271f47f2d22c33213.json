Adapted from the 2004 novel by David Mitchell, the film features multiple plotlines set across six different eras. The official synopsis for Cloud Atlas describes the film as: &quot;An exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one another in the past, present and future, as one soul is shaped from a killer into a hero, and an act of kindness ripples across centuries to inspire a revolution.&quot;[10]\n\nDuring four years of development the project met difficulties securing financial support; it was eventually produced with a $102 million budget provided by independent sources, making Cloud Atlas one of the most expensive independent films of all time. Production began in September 2011 at Studio Babelsberg in Potsdam-Babelsberg, Germany.\n\nThe film premiered on 9 September 2012 at the 37th Toronto International Film Festival[11] and was released on 26 October 2012 in conventional and IMAX cinemas.[12]\n\nCloud Atlas polarized critics, and has subsequently been included on various Best Film and Worst Film lists.[13][14][15] The film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score for Tykwer (who co-scored the film), Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heil\n\nSoftware :AnyDVD\n\nCompression :No\n\nFile :DVD9 Full\n\nLanguage :Ita / Eng\n\nSub :Italiano\n\nExtra :Yes\n\nMenÃƒÂ¹: Yes\n\nSize :7,56 GB\n\nFile :Folder\n\n Use NERO to burn .iso, burn to DVD a low speed for best results, or use DEAMON TOOLS to mount .iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ba9722401ef7c7bb244cba271f47f2d22c33213","amp;dn":"Cloud+Atlas+DVD9+ENG+ITA+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ba9722401ef7c7bb244cba271f47f2d22c33213","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,169,114,36,1,239,124,123,178,68,203,162,113,244,127,45,34,195,50,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
