The impoverished child of Irish immigrants, she grows up to become one of the wealthiest and most controversial women of her day.\n\nIn vivid prose, Axie recounts how she is forcibly separated from her mother and siblings, apprenticed to a doctor, and how she and her husband parlay the sale of a few bottles of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lunar Tablets for Female ComplaintÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ into a thriving midwifery business. Flouting convention and defying the law in the name of womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reproductive rights, Axie rises from grim tenement rooms to the splendor of a mansion on Fifth Avenue, amassing wealth while learning over and over never to trust a man who says Ã¢â‚¬Å“trust me.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nWhen her services attract outraged headlines, Axie finds herself on a collision course with a crusading officialÃ¢â‚¬â€Anthony Comstock, founder of the Society for the Suppression of Vice. It will take all of AxieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cunning and power to outwit him in the fight to preserve her freedom and everything she holds dear.\n\nInspired by the true history of an infamous female physician who was once called Ã¢â‚¬Å“the Wickedest Woman in New York,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ My Notorious Life is a mystery, a family saga, a love story, and an exquisitely detailed portrait of nineteenth-century America. Axie MuldoonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inimitable voice brings the past alive, and her story haunts and enlightens the present.\n================\n\nDovah","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5211e868553b6e995d38a8e6a6959d24e12bdadd","amp;dn":"Kate+Manning%2C+My+Notorious+Life+kindle+epub+dovah","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5211e868553b6e995d38a8e6a6959d24e12bdadd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,17,232,104,85,59,110,153,93,56,168,230,166,149,157,36,225,43,218,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
