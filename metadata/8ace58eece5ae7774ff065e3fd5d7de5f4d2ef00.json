A schoolgirl has gone missing, and Eddie suspects it's one of several crimes dating back six years; the police think not and blame gypsies. Eddie digs; the police stonewall him then two of them beat him after he visits the widowed mother of one of the girls missing for a few years. When a child's body turns up at a construction site of local building magnate John Dawson, Eddie has another thread to pull. By now, he's begun an affair with Paula, the widowed mom, and he suspects collusion among Dawson, the police, and his newspaper - but what are they covering up?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ace58eece5ae7774ff065e3fd5d7de5f4d2ef00","amp;dn":"Red.Riding.In.The.Year.Of.Our.Lord.1974.2009.1080p.Bluray.X264-B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ace58eece5ae7774ff065e3fd5d7de5f4d2ef00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,206,88,238,206,90,231,119,79,240,101,227,253,93,125,229,244,210,239,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
