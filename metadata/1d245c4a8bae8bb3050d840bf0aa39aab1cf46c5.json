A precocious anarchist firebrand, young Victor was sentenced to five years in a French penitentiary in 1912. Expelled to Spain in 1917, he participated in an anarcho-syndicalist uprising before leaving to join the Revolution in Russia. Detained for more than a year in a French concentration camp, Serge arrived in St. Petersburg early in 1919 and joined the Bolsheviks, serving in the press services of the Communist International. An outspoken critic of Stalin, Serge was expelled from the Party and arrested in 1929. Nonetheless, he managed to complete three novels (Men in Prison, Birth of Our Power, and Conquered City) and a history Year One of the Russian Revolution, published in Paris. Arrested again in Russia and deported to Central Asia in 1933, he was allowed to leave the USSR in 1936 after international protests by militants and prominent writers like AndrÃƒÂ© Gide and Romain Rolland. Using his insiderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s knowledge, Serge published a stream of impassioned, documented exposÃƒÂ©s of StalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Moscow show trials and of machinations in Spain, which went largely unheeded. Stateless, penniless, hounded by Stalinist agents, Serge lived in precarious exile in Brussels, Paris, Vichy France, and Mexico City, where he died in 1947. His classic Memoirs of a Revolutionary and his great last novels, Unforgiving Years and The Case of Comrade Tulayev, were written Ã¢â‚¬Å“for the desk drawerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and published posthumously.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following books, and all are in ePUB format unless otherwise stated:\n\nFiction\n\n\n* The Case of Comrade Tulayev - Victor Serge, introduction by Susan Sontag, translated from the French by Willard R.
