The volume presents 5 parts which cover fabrication techniques, material properties, characterization techniques, processing and applications. Much attention was given in the past to its luminescent properties, but increasingly it is the biodegradability, mechanical, thermal and sensing capabilities that are attracting attention. The volume is divided into focussed data reviews with, wherever possible, quantitative rather than qualitative descriptions of both properties and performance. The book is targeted at undergraduates, postgraduates and experienced researchers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98ab1058fc20f0892e03fbede12b0857d4268cd8","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Porous+Silicon+-+Leigh+Canham","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98ab1058fc20f0892e03fbede12b0857d4268cd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,171,16,88,252,32,240,137,46,3,251,237,225,43,8,87,212,38,140,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
