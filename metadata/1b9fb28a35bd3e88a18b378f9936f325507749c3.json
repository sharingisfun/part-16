Indeed it was because of Chuang Tzu and the other Taoist sages that Indian Buddhism was transformed, in China, into the unique vehicle we now call by its Japanese nameâ€”Zen.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese sage abounds in wit, paradox, satire, and shattering insight into the true ground of being. Father Merton, no stranger to Asian thought, brings a vivid, modern idiom to the timeless wisdom of Tao. This re-creation of an ancient sage by a contemporary poet is presented with an introduction on the meaning of Taoism for the West today. Illustrated with early Chinese drawings.\r\n\r\n&quot;Written in a pleasing, readable and poetic style ... it is useful and delightful. ... &quot; - Choice\r\n\r\n&quot;A most admirable introduction to this less known but most important source-book of Taoism.'' - Alan Watts, New York Times Book Review","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b9fb28a35bd3e88a18b378f9936f325507749c3","amp;dn":"The+Way+of+Chuang+Tzu+-+Thomas+Merton+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b9fb28a35bd3e88a18b378f9936f325507749c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,159,178,138,53,189,62,136,161,139,55,143,153,54,243,37,80,119,73,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
