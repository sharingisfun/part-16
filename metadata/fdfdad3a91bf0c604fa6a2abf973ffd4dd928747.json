The album includes 40 tracks spanning over 35 years of music. Four of the songs were new recordings of classic Gibb compositions originally recorded by other artists, including &quot;Emotion&quot; (Samantha Sang), &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; (Dionne Warwick), &quot;Islands In The Stream&quot; (Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton), and &quot;Immortality&quot; (Celine Dion). It also features the Barry Gibb duet with Barbra Streisand, &quot;Guilty&quot;, which originally appeared on Streisand's 1980 album of the same name. The album peaked at #5 twice in the UK, the first time upon its release in 2001 and again in January 2003 (following the death of Maurice Gibb). It has since been certifed triple platinum by the BPI for sales of over 900,000 copies. In the US, the album debuted on the Billboard 200 album chart at #49. It spent a total of 40 weeks on the chart and was certified platinum by the RIAA in February 2002 for sales of over 1 million copies there.\n\nJose F. Promis, All Music Guide - Their Greatest Hits: The Record stands as the best Bee Gees hits package available, assembling both vital European and American hits from their early-'60s period all the way through to 2001. Disc one includes their major '60s and early-'70s hits, up to &quot;You Should Be Dancing.&quot; Included are their major American hits, such as &quot;New York Mining Disaster 1941,&quot; &quot;Massachusetts,&quot; &quot;To Love Somebody,&quot; &quot;Lonely Days,&quot; &quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart,&quot; &quot;Jive Talkin',&quot; &quot;Nights on Broadway,&quot; and &quot;Words,&quot; as well as major European hits, such as &quot;World&quot; and the gorgeous &quot;Don't Forget to Remember.&quot; Also included on disc one is the former B-side &quot;If I Can't Have You&quot; (popularized, of course, by Yvonne Elliman). Disc two continues the formula, beginning with the cultural phenomenon that was &quot;Stayin' Alive&quot; and continuing with &quot;How Deep Is Your Love,&quot; &quot;Night Fever,&quot; &quot;Too Much Heaven,&quot; &quot;Tragedy,&quot; and &quot;Love You Inside and Out.&quot; Disc two also includes Barry Gibb's hit duet with Barbra Streisand, &quot;Guilty,&quot; as well as major European hits such as &quot;You Win Again&quot; and &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls,&quot; and later American hits such as &quot;One,&quot; &quot;Alone,&quot; and their superb 2001 single &quot;This Is Where I Came In.&quot; As a bonus treat, the album includes four newly recorded versions of Bee Gees songs which became hits for other artists. These include &quot;Emotion,&quot; which was popularized by Samantha Sang and later Destiny's Child; &quot;Heartbreaker,&quot; which was a comeback smash for Dionne Warwick; the chart-topping &quot;Islands in the Stream,&quot; which was a hit for Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton; and &quot;Immortality,&quot; a European hit for Celine Dion. A wonderful, stellar collection through and through from one of the rock era's biggest, brightest, most influential, and most exciting acts. As a final note, the European version of this collection includes two songs which were annoyingly left off the American version: &quot;Jumbo&quot; and &quot;My World.&quot;\n\nDisc 01 \n\n[01] New York Mining Disaster 1941 \n[02] To Love Somebody \n[03] Holiday \n[04] Massachusetts \n[05] World \n[06] Words \n[07] I've Gotta Get A Message To You \n[08] I Started A Joke \n[09] First Of May \n[10] Saved By The Bell \n[11] Don't Forget To Remember \n[12] Lonely Days \n[13] How Can You Mend A Broken Heart \n[14] Run To Me \n[15] Jive Talkin' \n[16] Nights On Broadway \n[17] Fanny (Be Tender With My Love) \n[18] Love So Right \n[19] If I Can't Have You \n[20] Love Me \n[21] You Should Be Dancin' \n\nDisc 01 Play Time - 01h:11m:02s\n\nDisc 02 \n\n[01] Stayin' Alive \n[02] How Deep Is Your Love \n[03] Night Fever \n[04] More Than A Woman \n[05] Emotion \n[06] Too Much Heaven \n[07] Tragedy \n[08] Love You Inside Out \n[09] Guilty \t&gt; Barbra Streisand &amp; \n[10] Heartbreaker \n[11] Islands In The Stream \n[12] You Win Again \n[13] One \n[14] Secret Love \n[15] For Whom The Bell Tolls \n[16] Alone \n[17] Immortality \n[18] This Is Where I Came In \n[19] Spicks And Specks \n\nDisc 02 Play Time - 01h:18m:21s\n\nTotal FLAC  Play Time\t&gt; 02h:29m:23s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 1.05GB (Including FLAC, Art Covers &amp; File)\nMusic File Type\t&gt; Exact Audio Copy V1.0 beta 1 - FLAC Level 8\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop Rock Disco\nRelease Date\t&gt; 12 November 2001 [UK[  20 November 2001 [US]\nRecord Company\t&gt; Polydor\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt; http://www.officialbeegees.com\n&gt; http://www.beegees.com\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee_Gees\n&gt; http://www.eddy.mv.ru/bee.html\n&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/b/beegees.html\n&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/beegees\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdfdad3a91bf0c604fa6a2abf973ffd4dd928747","amp;dn":"%5B2001%5D+The+Record+%28Their+Greatest+Hits%29+-+Bee+Gees+FLAC+%5Bonly1jo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdfdad3a91bf0c604fa6a2abf973ffd4dd928747","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,253,173,58,145,191,12,96,79,166,162,171,249,115,255,212,221,146,135,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
