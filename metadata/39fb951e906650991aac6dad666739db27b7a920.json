This is an unofficial port of CorsixTH to Android.\n\nPlease read this first!\n\nIt's highly recommended that you play on a tablet, but a SGS3 / Galaxy Nexus / Nexus 4 might just be big enough to play comfortably.\n\nPlease be aware that CorsixTH isn't complete yet, and this port is still in its own experimental stage. EXPECT BUGS, THINGS TO BE BROKEN (or not even exist!) AND GENERAL WEIRDNESS. You have been warned.\n\nYou can play the demo version out of the box, but YOU WILL NEED THE FULL VERSION OF THEME HOSPITAL ON YOUR DEVICE IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THE FULL GAME. Instructions on how to do that can be found here\n\nIf you have any problems at all, please do contact me because I can't reply to comments left in the reviews and if I'm not aware of the exact problem, I can't make any attempt to fix it! I try to reply to every email, but this is a product of my spare time so please be patient.\nControls\n\nTap and hold to pick up objects/staff and to rotate\n\nDrag with two fingers to move the map","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39fb951e906650991aac6dad666739db27b7a920","amp;dn":"Theme+Hospital+Android","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39fb951e906650991aac6dad666739db27b7a920","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,251,149,30,144,102,80,153,26,172,109,173,102,103,57,219,39,183,169,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
