Taking place (appropriately enough) in\n1156 B.C., you play Ramose, a young Egyptian man who hopes to prove himself a\nworthy investigator for the current rulers of Egypt. Your first assignment is\nnot an easy one, as a Tomb of Sethi I, a pharaoh has been desecrated and\nlooted and your own father has been accused of the crime. You have three days\nto prove his innocence and stay the sentence of execution.\n\nGameplay takes place in a first person mode similar to fans of this kind of\nadventure game. Unlike some games that give you a static, unmoving image to\nlook at, Egypt 1156 B.C. allows you to look around at any location in a\nsmooth turn (similar to QuickTime VR, but with better results). This gives\nyou a 'you are there' feel that many other games lack. All graphics are 3-D\nrendered and occassionally actions will give you a third person cutscene as a\nreward. Communication is through a simple branch tree and both talking and\npuzzle solving involves the manipulation of objects, both in and out of your\ninventory.\n\nIn addition to being a mystery/adventure game, Egypt 1156 B.C. also comes\nwith reference material about ancient Egypt, its people, and its culture.\nThese are available whenever you discover something interesting in the middle\nof the game or can be accessed via the main menu.\n\nUnpack,mount,install and play.\nRuns fine on Windows 7 32-bit.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99b6bcf9edcb7ef6513c582260d9b0600131f0dc","amp;dn":"Egypt+1156+B.C.%3A+Tomb+of+the+Pharaoh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99b6bcf9edcb7ef6513c582260d9b0600131f0dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,182,188,249,237,203,126,246,81,60,88,34,96,217,176,96,1,49,240,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
