(certified guitar player):\na DVD entitled Live at Her Majesty&amp;#039;s Theatre, Ballarat, Australia, followed by\nthe CD The Mystery.\n\nA finger style guitarist inspired by the legendary Chet Atkins (who became one\nof Emmanuel&amp;#039;s biggest fans and gave him the title c.g.p.), he can simultaneously\nplay multiple parts, much like a pianist does with his left and right hands. But\nhis astounding technique isn&amp;#039;t just for show; Emmanuel uses it to organically\nblend folk, country, jazz, and other influences in his highly personal, emotive\ncompositions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e828a91707cc239ce713c5363d450145dcd33921","amp;dn":"Tommy_Emmanuel-The_Mystery-2006-KzT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e828a91707cc239ce713c5363d450145dcd33921","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,40,169,23,7,204,35,156,231,19,197,54,61,69,1,69,220,211,57,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
