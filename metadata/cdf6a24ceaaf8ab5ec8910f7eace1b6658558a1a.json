ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s even more of that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAh haÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½so thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s how they do it,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ straight-to-the-point, skip-the-techno-jargon stuff you can really use today to make your shots even better.\n\nThis book truly has a brilliant premise, and hereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s how Scott describes it: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf you and I were out on a shoot and you asked me, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Hey Scott, I want the light for this portrait to look really soft and flattering. How far back should I put this softbox?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ I wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t give you a lecture about lighting ratios, or flash modifiers. In real life, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d just turn to you and say, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Move it in as close to your subject as you possibly can, without it actually showing up in the shot.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Well, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what this book is all about: you and I out shooting where I answer questions, give you advice, and share the secrets IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve learned, just like I would with a friendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½without all the technical explanations and techie photo speak.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nEach page covers a single concept on how to make your photography better. Every time you turn the page, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn another pro setting, tool, or trick to transform your work from snapshots into gallery prints. If youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re tired of taking shots that look ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œokay,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re tired of looking in photography magazines and thinking, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhy donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t my shots look like that?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ then this is the book for you.\n\nThis isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t a book of theoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½full of confusing jargon and detailed concepts. This is a book on which button to push, which setting to use, and when to use it. With nearly 200 more of the most closely guarded photographic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtricks of the trade,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ this book gets you shooting dramatically better-looking, sharper, more colorful, more professional-looking photos every time.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nScott Kelby is the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s #1 best-selling author of computer and technology books, as well as Editor and Publisher of Photoshop User magazine, and President of the National Association of PhotoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“shop ProÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“fessionals (NAPP).
