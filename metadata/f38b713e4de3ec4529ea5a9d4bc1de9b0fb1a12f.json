The album received massive acclaim from the music press and was embraced by fans of indie and rock music, as well as fans of garage. The album originally rose to #12 on the UK Albums Chart in 2002, but peaked at #10 in 2004 after the release of his significantly more successful second album A Grand Don't Come for Free. \nIn the United Kingdom, five singles were released from Original Pirate Material: &quot;Has It Come to This?&quot;, &quot;Let's Push Things Forward&quot;, &quot;Weak Become Heroes&quot;, &quot;Don't Mug Yourself&quot; and &quot;The Irony of It All&quot;.\nThe cover artwork photograph of Original Pirate Material is by German photographer Rut Blees Luxemburg called Towering Inferno.
