A biological bomb has just been discovered in the air ducts\nof a busy suburban mall. At first nobody knows if it's even life threatening,\nbut then the entire complex is quarantined, people start getting sick,\nsupplies start running low, and there's no way out. Among the hundreds\nof trapped shoppers are four teens. These four different narrators, each\nwith their own stories, must cope in unique, surprising styles, changing\nin ways they wouldn't have predicted, trying to find solace, safety, and\nescape at a time when the adults are behaving badly.\n\nThis is a gripping look at people and how they can--and must--change\nunder the most dire of circumstances. And not always for the better.\n\n\nNo Safety in Numbers (No Safety in Numbers #1)\nBy: Dayna Lorentz\nFormat: EPUB\nLanguage: EN\nPages: 380","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4241125ea2672cb36878f862d20da494c72ff56","amp;dn":"No+Safety+in+Numbers+%28No+Safety+in+Numbers+%231%29+by+Dayna+Lorentz+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4241125ea2672cb36878f862d20da494c72ff56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,36,17,37,234,38,114,203,54,135,143,134,45,32,218,73,76,114,255,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
