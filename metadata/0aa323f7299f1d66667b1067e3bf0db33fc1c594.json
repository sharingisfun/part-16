Life was more &quot;square&quot; than &quot;groovy&quot; and Dean Martin was topping the Billboard charts--not Jimmy Hendrix. In this blast from the past, Leaf exposes the lies and busts the myths propagated by the liberal establishment. Did you know:\n* The civil rights movement did little to improve the lives of average African Americans?\n* Most Americans actively supported the Vietnam War and the draft?\n* My Fair Lady was one of the most popular albums during the 1960s?\n\nThe Politically Incorrect Guide to the Sixties proves the anti-Vietnam War sentiment and free love slogans that supposedly &quot;defined&quot; the decade were just a small part of the leftist counter culture. The mainstream culture was more politically incorrect--but you'll never hear that from a liberal pundit or read it in a politically correct textbook.
