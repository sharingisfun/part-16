They are hunted and captured by three Indians; however Doug is rescued by the Trumpeter Tim that survived the massacre and is bringing a dispatch from General Crook to General George Armstrong Custer. Doug escapes but the leader of the Indians, Crazy Horse, brings Tony to the Indian camp to get information about the &quot;Yellow Hair&quot;. Meanwhile, the Time Tunnel personnel summon the specialist in the Indian Wars period and Sioux descendent Dr. Charles Whitebird to provide information about the location. The researcher advises that the place is Montana and the day is the eve of the day of The Battle of the Little Bighorn, where Custer and the 7th Cavalry Regiment where defeated and annihilated by the Indians led by Sitting Bull.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e5e573f995c1d2cde0adeb0b9867e9b0b8674bc","amp;dn":"The+Time+Tunnel+-+Massacre+Ep.+8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e5e573f995c1d2cde0adeb0b9867e9b0b8674bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,94,87,63,153,92,29,44,222,10,222,176,185,134,126,155,11,134,116,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
