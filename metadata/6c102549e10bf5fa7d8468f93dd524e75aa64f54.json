It uses a newly developed &quot;blind deconvolution&quot; technique to calculate the blur and to recalculate the original (sharp) image.\n\nIt is possible to achieve results that are far better than the image sharpening in many image editing programs. However, this requires the interactive cooperation of the user.\n\nPhotiosity runs on the CPU or on the graphics card (OpenCL).\nPhotiosity also contains an anti noise filter.\n\nEnglish and German instructions are attached.\n\nWhat's New:\n\n* A better method to find the Ã¢â‚¬Å“blur-freeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ optimum,\n\n* Bug-fixing.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel Mac, OS version: Mac OS X 10.7 or later\nProcessor type(s) &amp; speed: 64 Bit CPU\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c102549e10bf5fa7d8468f93dd524e75aa64f54","amp;dn":"Photiosity+v.+1.7.0+pre%5BK%7Dracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c102549e10bf5fa7d8468f93dd524e75aa64f54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,16,37,73,225,11,245,250,125,132,104,249,61,213,36,231,90,166,79,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
