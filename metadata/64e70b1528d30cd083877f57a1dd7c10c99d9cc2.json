We recorded everything live, in one room without headphones and hardly any overdubs. I&amp;#039;m very proud of On My Way&amp;#039;s spontaneity and honesty. I&amp;#039;m especially proud of the song &quot;On My Way&quot;. I feel it&amp;#039;s one of my best.&quot;\n\nTouring\n\nThe touring band for the album featured John Kent from Radish and Jason Roberts on guitar. On My Way was their first headlining tour in France. Ben Kweller also co-headlined with Death Cab For Cutie and Incubus in the US. Kweller also performed in Japan with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and the White Stripes. Towards the end of touring, Kweller opened for The Black Crowes at one of their Hammerstein reunion shows.\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;I Need You Back&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17\n   2. &quot;Hospital Bed&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37\n   3. &quot;My Apartment&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:57\n   4. &quot;On My Way&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n   5. &quot;The Rules&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:37\n   6. &quot;Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n   7. &quot;Living Life&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02\n   8. &quot;Ann Disaster&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:08\n   9. &quot;Believer&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:59\n  10. &quot;Hear Me Out&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44\n  11. &quot;Different but the Same&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:02\n\nPersonnel\n\n    * Ben Kweller - Lead Vocals, Guitar, Harmonica, Piano, Art Direction\n    * Josh Lattanzi - Bass guitar, Vocals\n    * Mike Stroud - Guitar, Vocals\n    * John Kent - Drums\n    * Fred Eltringham - Drums\n    * Steve Mazur - Engineer\n    * Steve Ralbovsky - A&amp;R\n    * Brett Kilroe - Art Direction\n    * Greg Calbi - Mastering\n    * Ethan Johns - Percussion, Mixing, Engineer, Producer\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64e70b1528d30cd083877f57a1dd7c10c99d9cc2","amp;dn":"Ben+Kweller%3A++On+My+Way--vikingsfreak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64e70b1528d30cd083877f57a1dd7c10c99d9cc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,231,11,21,40,211,12,208,131,135,127,87,161,221,124,16,201,157,156,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
