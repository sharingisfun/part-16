Whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re responsible for just 50 computers or more than 1000 computers, BatchPatch will save you a LOT of time. No more logging on to each computer to initiate the update installation. No more manually rebooting each machine and launching numerous ping windows to keep track of the reboot process. Finally, an app that lets you load a list of computers, and then kick off the Windows update installation and reboot process on all of them, simultaneously. You can now sit back, relax, and watch your computers update themselves.\n\nFeatures:\n\nInitiate the download and / or installation of Windows updates on MANY remote computers simultaneously from a single console. Watch this video tutorial for details.\nChoose to install all available updates or just specific updates, by name. Additional filters are also available, allowing you to select updates by their classification groupings: Critical Updates, Security Updates, Definition Updates, Updates, Update Rollups, Service Packs, Feature Packs, Drivers, and Tools. Or mimic Microsoft Update and choose to install only Ã¢â‚¬Å“ImportantÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and/or Ã¢â‚¬Å“RecommendedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ updates.\nUse your own managed WSUS server, or use BatchPatch in conjunction with Microsoft Update as an effective WSUS alternative.\nDeploy standalone Microsoft or third-party patches such as Adobe or Java updates, as well as registry keys, scripts, and just about anything else to remote hosts. Push install MSIs remotely to multiple computers (.msi .msp .msu .exe .reg .vbs .ps1 .cmd and more). Take a look at this remote installation tutorial or this video tutorial or the BatchPatch AdministratorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Guide for more info.\nInstall software remotely to an entire network of computers with just a few of clicks.\nBatchPatch offers a very convenient method for remote script execution, enabling you to easily and quickly retrieve information from your target computers, push configuration changes, apply custom settings, and do just about anything else you can think of.\nReboot or shutdown remote hosts and monitor status in real-time with integrated pinging.\nNo remote agent installation required! Simply launch BatchPatch and start patching.\nIntegrated job queues: You can create a set of actions to execute sequentially on remote hosts, which allows you to run scripts before and/or after reboot, or string together multiple patch and reboot cycles etc.\nExecute your own custom scripts locally or remotely or add them to job queues for full automation flexibility.\nStart and stop services, remotely.\nTerminate remote processes.\nIntegrated task scheduler: Launch any task or job queue on a specific date and time.\nRetrieve the last boot time from remote hosts (very handy when rebooting computers).\nRetrieve the used/free C: disk space from remote hosts (make sure the remote hosts have enough space available for patch installations).\nRetrieve the list of services that are set to Ã¢â‚¬Å“AutomaticÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ but not currently running on the remote hosts (diagnose bootup issues).\nLaunch remote desktop connections to hosts in the grid.\nWake on LAN.\n\nSupported OS:\n\nWindows 2000 SP3/SP4, XP, Vista, 7, 8/8.1, 2003/2003R2, 2008/2008R2, 2012/2012R2.\n\nHomepage: http://batchpatch.com/\n\nInstallation Instructions: \n\n1) Make sure app is not running.\n2) Copy keygen next to the application.\n3) Execute keygen and apply the patch.\n4) Fill first and last name (edit box 1 and 2).\n5) Execute app. and register it with the regcode computed previously (menu licensing).\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:139371e4aa99f7bc57ce11b271ce06ddb1d2794a","amp;dn":"Cocobolo+Software+BatchPatch+v2014.1.1.16.1+Enterprise+Incl+Keyg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"139371e4aa99f7bc57ce11b271ce06ddb1d2794a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,147,113,228,170,153,247,188,87,206,17,178,113,206,6,221,177,210,121,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
