Australia - Season 6, Episode 1\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Denton\n\nBroadcaster Andrew Denton is perhaps best known for his in-depth interview series 'Enough Rope' but how closely has he interrogated his own story?\nAndrew knows that his father Kit, famed for his book 'The Breaker' about Breaker Morant, was actually born Arnold Ditkofsky and that his parents were Jewish. But while Andrew grew up in a secular household and his father was a proud atheist, the ancestral trail resonates with clashes of faith and family. Could the key be an heirloom kept in the family treasure trove?\nAndrew's journey takes him to London and a great grandfather taking a stand against anti-Semitic street thugs and to Poland into the dark heart of the Holocaust. Finally in Israel he uncovers an enticing possible genetic link to one of the best known stories in the Bible.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 08-Jul-2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db43d8c8f405d9920c8d5041c271d39b95cbaad0","amp;dn":"Who.Do.You.Think.You.Are.AU.S06E01.Andrew.Denton.PDTV.x264-Thena","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db43d8c8f405d9920c8d5041c271d39b95cbaad0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,67,216,200,244,5,217,146,12,141,80,65,194,113,211,155,149,203,170,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
