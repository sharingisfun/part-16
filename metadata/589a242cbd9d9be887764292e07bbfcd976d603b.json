This book provides a fundamental understanding of GIS, including how to develop and analyze geographic data, how to differentiate between the various types of geographic data, and how to assess the operational requirements needed to implement GIS. With an introduction to primary remote sensing as well as methods of interpretation and analysis, the text focuses on how GIS data can be applied to water resource analysis models. Such applications include water supply demand forecasting, hydrologic modeling watersheds, modeling erosion, and non-point sources of water pollution.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:589a242cbd9d9be887764292e07bbfcd976d603b","amp;dn":"Geographic+Information+Systems+in+Water+Resources+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"589a242cbd9d9be887764292e07bbfcd976d603b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,154,36,44,189,157,155,232,135,118,66,146,224,123,191,205,151,109,96,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
