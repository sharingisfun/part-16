I'm Zoe Boutin Perry: A colonist stranded on a deadly pioneer world. Holy icon to a race of aliens. A player (and a pawn) in a interstellar chess match to save humanity, or to see it fall. Witness to history. Friend. Daughter. Human. Seventeen years old.\n\nEveryone on Earth knows the tale I am part of. But you don't know my tale: How I did what I did Ã¢â‚¬â€ how I did what I had to do Ã¢â‚¬â€ not just to stay alive but to keep you alive, too. All of you. I'm going to tell it to you now, the only way I know how: not straight but true, the whole thing, to try to make you feel what I felt: the joy and terror and uncertainty, panic and wonder, despair and hope. Everything that happened, bringing us to Earth, and Earth out of its captivity. All through my eyes.\n\nIt's a story you know. But you don't know it all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c720453759f728747384ea26518f5e6406582540","amp;dn":"Zoe%27s+Tale+-+John+Scalzi.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c720453759f728747384ea26518f5e6406582540","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,32,69,55,89,247,40,116,115,132,234,38,81,143,94,100,6,88,37,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
