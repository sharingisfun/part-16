Only the OBI strip was missing..... Unfortunately the pictures didn't show how nice this one is made. The condition of the record is a clear mint, maybe played a couple times. After a the obligatoric standrad washing procedure on my RCM the record plays extremly quite and virtually without any clicks. (Though I found a few which I removed)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91f9eecfcac80306e7b9d6d57bbf0d397d65f475","amp;dn":"%5B24%2F96%5D+Elton+John+-+Honky+Chateau+-+1972%2C+Vinyl+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91f9eecfcac80306e7b9d6d57bbf0d397d65f475","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,249,238,207,202,200,3,6,231,185,214,213,123,191,13,57,125,101,244,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
