The track listings is showing 18 songs. It should only be showing 12 songs. I have tried to number the tracks as best as I can from tracks 13-18, but I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know if they are remixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s / radio edits etc. These are effectively bonus tracks.\nThe CD came with only a front cover (no booklet or back cover), so I am thinking this was some kind of promo CD Album. \nOn Track 4 the song finishes about 2 seconds early.\n***********************************************************************************\n\nMore Than a Woman is the fourth studio album (fifth overall) by American R&amp;B singerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“songwriter Toni Braxton, released in the United States on November 19, 2002 by Arista Records.
