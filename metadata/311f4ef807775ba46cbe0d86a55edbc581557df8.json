Churuya-san\n\n  Summary:\n\nI thought that when i entered high school, my days of believing in aliens, time\ntravelers and ESPers were going to be over. That is until she introduced herself.\nClaiming to be interested in only aliens, time travelers, and ESPers, Haruhi\nSuzumiya was the Strangest girl I've met in a long time... Before I knew what's \ngoing on. I've been dragged into her weird club,and it look like i'm not the only \none who has been drafted into this 'SOS Brigade' of hers, because there are three\nother students who don't seem to be so ordinary themselves. Either way we've all\nfound ourselves caught up in Haruhi's quest to search for all things extraordinary.\nAnd what's this i hear about us making a movie?\n\nThe Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya Summary:\n\nTen days before Christmas, it seemed like anther ordinary day for the SOS Brigade;\nHaruhi came up with another one of her crazy ideas to hold a Christmas party in the\nclub room. But then things got weirder from there... The next day Kyon woke up to \na world in which Haruhi didn't exist and no one besides him had any memory of her.\nHow can someone like Haruhi Suzumiya, who's supposed to be center of the universe,\njust vanish?\n\nAudio: English,Japanese\n\nSubtitles: English\n\nDisplay aspect ratio: 16:9\n\nFormat: MKV\n\n\n\n                               Please Seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:311f4ef807775ba46cbe0d86a55edbc581557df8","amp;dn":"The+Melancholy+of+Haruhi+Suzumiya+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"311f4ef807775ba46cbe0d86a55edbc581557df8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,31,78,248,7,119,91,164,108,190,13,134,165,94,219,197,129,85,125,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
