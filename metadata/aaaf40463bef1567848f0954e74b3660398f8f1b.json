It was also the final full studio effort from the group, and what a way to bow out ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ there was practically no resemblance to the trash glam flailers on Adolescent Sex anymore. Rather than repeat the sheer restraint on Gentlemen Take Polaroids, Tin Drum is an album of energy, Sylvian's singing still the decadently joyful thing it is, but the arrangements and performances tight, full, and active. The fusion of exquisite funk courtesy of Karn and Jansen's joined-at-the-hip rhythm section and a range of Asian music influences, from instrumentation to subject matter, combined with an even wider use of technological approaches to create the dramatic, sly songs on offer. Only the Talking Heads showed the same attempt at reach and variety at the time, at least in the Western rock world, but Japan arguably outstripped the New York band with its sheer sense of theatrical style. To top it all off, the band was more popular than ever, with &quot;Ghosts,&quot; an appropriately haunting ballad notable for its utterly minimal arrangement, almost entirely eschewing beats for Barbieri's textures and Jansen's work on marimba, becoming a Top Ten hit in the U.K. The wound-up dancefloor art grooves of &quot;The Art of Parties&quot; and especially &quot;Visions of China,&quot; the latter featuring what has to be Karnand Jansen's eternal highlight performance (check out Jansen's jaw-dropping drum break) were also notable efforts. Meanwhile, the evocation of Chinese culture in general continued with such songs as &quot;Canton,&quot; a slightly martial, stately march with clear inspiration from the country's classical music tradition, and the concluding &quot;Cantonese Boy.&quot;&quot;\n\nWikipedia bio &quot;Bamboo Houses&quot;:\n&quot;&quot;Bamboo Houses&quot; is a song by Japanese musician and composer Ryuichi Sakamoto and English musician, composer and singer David Sylvian, released on Virgin Records in 1982. The double A-side single &quot;Bamboo Houses&quot;/&quot;Bamboo Music&quot; was the first solo project by Sylvian, released while he was still a member of the band Japan. It was the second collaboration between the two, the first being the track &quot;Taking Islands in Africa&quot; on the 1980 Japan album Gentlemen Take Polaroids which featured Sakamoto on keyboards. The &quot;Bamboo Houses&quot; single in turn featured drums by Japan member Steve Jansen, who also appeared in the promo video, and was co-produced by Steve Nye.&quot;\n\nWikipedia bio &quot;Forbidden Colours&quot;:\n&quot;&quot;Forbidden Colours&quot; is a song composed by Japanese musician Ryuichi Sakamoto with lyrics by English musician, composer and singer David Sylvian. The song is the vocal version of the theme from the Nagisa Oshima film Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (in certain territories retitled Furyo) and was first released on the soundtrack album. &quot;Forbidden Colours&quot;, also issued as a duet single on Virgin Records in 1983, was the second collaborative single release by Sylvian and Sakamoto, following 1982's &quot;Bamboo Houses&quot;. The title of the song and its lyrics reflect the main themes of the movie; the clashes between not only two countries at war but also two vastly different cultures, difficulties on both sides in accepting or even trying to understand the differences in mentality, the contrasting definitions of honour and shame, as well as the underlying homoerotic tension between the two main characters, Japanese Captain Yonoi (played by Sakamoto himself) and British war prisoner Jack Celliers (David Bowie), and the fine line between love and hate and consequently life and death - hence &quot;my love wears forbidden colours&quot;. In 1984 the track was re-recorded and released as the B-side to &quot;Red Guitar&quot;, the lead single to Sylvian's first solo album Brilliant Trees and was later also included as a bonus track on certain editions of his 1987 album Secrets of the Beehive.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nTRACK LIST\n\nTin Drum\n\n==========\n\n01.
