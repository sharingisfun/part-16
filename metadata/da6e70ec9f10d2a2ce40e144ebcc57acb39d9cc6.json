While providing a thorough analysis of classical short rate models, the primary focus of the volume is on multi-factor stochastic volatility dynamics, in the setups of both the separable HJM and Libor market models. Implementation techniques are covered in detail, as are strategies for model parameterization and calibration to market data.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nVolume II. Term Structure Models \n\n      Part III. Term Structure Models \nOne-Factor Short Rate Models I\nOne-Factor Short Rate Models II\nMulti-Factor Short Rate Models\nThe Quasi-Gaussian Model with Local and Stochastic Volatility\nThe Libor Market Model I\nThe Libor Market Model II\n\n\nABOUT THE AUTHORS\nVladimir V. Piterbarg is a Managing Director and the Global Head of the Quantitative Analytics group at Barclays Capital, and has worked since 1997 as an interest rate quant at top investment banks. He taught at the University of Chicago Mathematical Finance program for a number of years, and is a prolific and respected researcher in the area of interest rate modeling. He won two Risk Magazine's Quant of the Year Awards (2006 and 2011), and holds a PhD in Mathematics (Probability Theory) from the University of Southern California. He serves as an associate editor of the Journal of Computational Finance and the Journal of Investment Strategies.\n\nTogether with Leif B.G. Andersen, Vladimir V. Piterbarg is the author of the authoritative, 1,200 page long, three-volume set of books &quot;Interest Rate Modeling&quot;.
