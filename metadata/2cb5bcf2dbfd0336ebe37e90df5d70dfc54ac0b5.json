Never thinking twice, as VMware is the guru of virtualization.\n\nUntil a few weeks ago, i discovered 'Spoon Studio' formerly known as Xenocode.\n\nBeing an experienced user of ThinApp, i dove right into Spoon Studio. I was\namazed! Spoon Studio offers many more options, the portable apps created peform\nbetter and faster with greater compatibility between OSes and architecture. In\naddition, portable apps created with Spoon Studio are dramatically smaller in\nsize. Spoon Studio offers tons of tweaks, templates, tools, etc. \n\nNoob? no problem. Spoon Studio provides templates for a few common applications\nto help you build your first portable application. \n\nWords cannot describe the shock i was in after trying and realizing Spoon Studio \nis far superior over ThinApp, it's not even close. Try it.. and you'll see!\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Example: Photoshop CS5 Portable &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6202766&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6202766&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cb5bcf2dbfd0336ebe37e90df5d70dfc54ac0b5","amp;dn":"Spoon.Studio.2011.v9.0.1439.1.Incl.Patch.And.License-SSQ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cb5bcf2dbfd0336ebe37e90df5d70dfc54ac0b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,181,188,242,219,253,3,54,235,227,126,144,223,93,112,223,197,74,192,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
