With a snotty lead vocal from keyboardist Ralph Scala and some wild-eyed guitar playing courtesy of then-16-year-old Emil &quot;Peppy&quot; Thielheim, America made the Magoos' debut single a Top Ten hit, sending it to number five in January 1967. With this impetus, the band used all the trappings of marketable psychedelia to promote their second album, Psychedelic Lollipop, which, despite the title's obvious pandering, was a fairly cool chunk of psych-garage rock. The album featured trebly, crappy-sounding guitars, a whiny Farfisa organ, yelled vocals, and a rhythm section that shelved nuance for thudding simplicity. But as the psychedelic era gave way to the hippie era's extended raga-rock proclivities, by 1969, the Magoos seemed anachronistic. Amazingly, they released a third album, with an equally absurd title, Electric Comic Book, that wasn't nearly as bad as it sounds. The original Magoos split up in 1969, but Thielheim couldn't resist beating a dead horse and led a mediocre blues-rock version of the band into 1972.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:d9ftxqr5ldte~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:d9ftxqr5ldte~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nThe Blues Magoos were one of the most underrated U.S. bands of the late '60s, known almost exclusively for their one irresistible hit &quot;(We Ain't Got) Nothing Yet,&quot; which charted at number five in July 1967. Kaleidescopic Compendium: The Best of the Blues Magoos confirms the group's depth. The disc compiles a generous 23 tracks from their first three albums and a brace of single sides. The group's psychedelia holds up better than most from the period. Andy Sandoval's four-page history of the group is concise, complete, and entertaining.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
