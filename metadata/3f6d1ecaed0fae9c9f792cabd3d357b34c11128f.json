That&amp;#039;s an adventure in its own, but Gravel also finds time to moonlight as a combat magician. It&amp;#039;s these two careers, and the character of the man who does them, that has been the focus of six miniseries by writer Warren Ellis and artist Mike Wolfer and published by Avatar Press.\n\nAlthough Warren Ellis is one of the best known writers in comics for such work as Transmetropolitan, The Authority and most recently Thunderbolts, his writings on William Gravel (chronicled in six Strange miniseries) is markedly more visceral and unforgiving. It is published by Avatar Press, with whom Ellis has a long relationship with that has also produced Black Summer, Crecy and Doktor Sleepless.\n\nThis torrent includes the following:\n\nGravel 000 (3 Covers) (2008) (Team-DCP)\nGravel 001 (All 3 Covers) (2008) (Team-DCP)\nGravel 002 (All Three Covers) (2008) (Steam-DCP)\nGravel 003 (2008) (2 covers) (Minutemen-Starsky &amp; Hutch)\nGravel 004 (All Three Covers) (2008) (Steam-DCP)\nGravel 005 (2008) (2 covers) (Minutemen-ReZone)\nGravel 006 (All Three Covers) (2008) (Steam-DCP)\n\n\n\nThanks to all the scanners and original uploaders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f6d1ecaed0fae9c9f792cabd3d357b34c11128f","amp;dn":"Gravel+1-6+%28Warren+Ellis%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f6d1ecaed0fae9c9f792cabd3d357b34c11128f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,109,30,202,237,15,174,156,159,121,44,171,211,211,87,179,76,17,18,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
