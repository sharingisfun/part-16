Day and night, Britain and the United States unleashed massive fleets of bombers to kill and terrorize occupied Europe, destroying its cities. The grisly consequences call into question how Ã¢â‚¬Å“moralÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ a war the Allies fought.\n\nThe Bombers and the Bombed radically overhauls our understanding of World War II. It pairs the story of the civilian front line in the Allied air war alongside the political context that shaped their strategic bombing campaigns, examining the responses to bombing and being bombed with renewed clarity.\n\nThe first book to examine seriously not only the well-known attacks on Dresden and Hamburg but also the significance of the firebombing on other fronts, including Italy, where the crisis was far more severe than anything experienced in Germany, this is Richard OveryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finest work yet. It is a rich reminder of the terrible military, technological, and ethical issues that relentlessly drove all the warÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s participants into an abyss.\n\n592 pages\nPublisher: Viking Adult; First Edition edition (February 20, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0670025151\nISBN-13: 978-0670025152","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a1170409d407e6ddbc47915bfa6afed9b9a14c3","amp;dn":"The+Bombers+%26amp%3B+the+Bombed%3A+Allied+Air+War+Over+Europe+1940-45","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a1170409d407e6ddbc47915bfa6afed9b9a14c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,17,112,64,157,64,126,109,219,196,121,21,191,166,175,237,155,154,20,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
