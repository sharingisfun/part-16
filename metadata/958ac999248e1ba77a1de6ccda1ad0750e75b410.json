After numerous delays those who pre-ordered Frank ZappaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Roxy By Proxy have finally received their CDs. \n\nThe 13-track release was recorded at The Roxy in Los Angeles on December 9 and 10, 1973. Frank is listed as the producer of the project, which was mixed in 1987, though Gail Zappa and Joe Travers are listed as producers for the CD and compilation. \n\nJohn Polito mastered the CD in 2011 and it includes liner notes from band member Ruth Underwood.\n\nA hard start to handle after such a long wait, so, leaving some old questions behind (why now?), straight, no chaser: this is going to be one of the most entertaining albums among those issued by the Zappa Family Trust in the XXI century. It could be a slight biased view, since here we truly enjoy those Ã¢â‚¬â„¢73-Ã¢â‚¬â„¢74 years, but on the other hand it is not easy to find a Frank Zappa enthusiast not fond of that period. Not only, if you are into it, you probably consider Roxy &amp; Elsewhere the best outcome in the Zappa catalog from those years. Those Roxy performances, that have been the core of the 1974 release, are back in a great shape and with some fresh new material awaiting to be discovered.\n\nActually the news department consists mainly of three previously unreleased arrangements out of a total of 12 tracks (track 1 is a spoken intro). Two of them, namely Inca Roads and the Kong/Chunga/Genes medley, being quite familiar to guerilla live tapes listeners (e.g. zappateers). \nHowever there is a chance that the third one, Cheepnis- Percussion, will sound as a great surprise for many. This rarely played number (just two marks in the FZShows document) consists of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“rhythm track of the next songÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a sort of Cheepnis karaoke for two drums and percussion, amazing and entertaining, sing along if you dare!\n\nThe album comes with a long and detailed essay by Ruth Underwood, a valuable companion for the set.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - ''Carved In The Rock''\n02 - Inca Roads\n03 - Penguin In Bondage\n04 - T'Mershi Duween\n05 - Dog Breath Variations - Uncle Meat\n06 - RDNZL\n07 - Village Of The Sun\n08 - Echidna's Arf (Of You)\n09 - Don't You Ever Wash That Thing\n10 - Cheepnis - Percussion\n11 - Cheepnis\n12 - Dupree's Paradise\n13 - King Kong-Chunga's Revenge-Mr. Green Genes\n\n\n*2014 Zappa Records / ZFT | ZR 20017\n\nPersonnel:\nFrank Zappa - guitar, vocals\nNapoleon Murphy Brock - tenor sax, flute, vocals\nGeorge Duke - keyboards, vocals\nBruce Fowler - trombone\nRuth Underwood - percussion\nTom Fowler - bass\nRalph Humphrey - drums\nChester Thompson - drums\n\n\nSome Frank Zappa Albums:\n\n\nFrank Zappa &amp; The Mothers of Invention - Carnegie Hall (2011) [4CD] [EAC-FLAC]:\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9342996/Frank_Zappa__amp__The_Mothers_-_Carnegie_Hall_(2011)_[4CD]_[EAC-&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9342996/Frank_Zappa__amp__The_Mothers_-_Carnegie_Hall_(2011)_[4CD]_[EAC-&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFrank Zappa - One Shot Deal (2008) [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10585193/Frank_Zappa_-_One_Shot_Deal_%282008%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10585193/Frank_Zappa_-_One_Shot_Deal_%282008%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFrank Zappa &amp; The Mothers - Ahead Of Their Time (1993) [EAC-FLAC]:\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10175562/Frank_Zappa__amp__The_Mothers_-_Ahead_Of_Their_Time_(1993)_[EAC-&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10175562/Frank_Zappa__amp__The_Mothers_-_Ahead_Of_Their_Time_(1993)_[EAC-&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFrank Zappa - Congress Shall Make No Law (2010) [EAC-FLAC]:\n         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9291125/Frank_Zappa_-_Congress_Shall_Make_No_Law_(2010)__[EAC-FLAC]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9291125/Frank_Zappa_-_Congress_Shall_Make_No_Law_(2010)__[EAC-FLAC]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nFrank Zappa - Joe's Album Collection (2004-2008) [4CD]:\n\n\nFrank Zappa - Joe's Menage (2008) [EAC-FLAC]:\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.ac/torrent/9315068/Frank_Zappa_-_Joe_s_Menage_(2008)__[EAC-FLAC]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.ac/torrent/9315068/Frank_Zappa_-_Joe_s_Menage_(2008)__[EAC-FLAC]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFrank Zappa - Joe's Corsage (2004) [EAC-FLAC]:\n        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9280442/Frank_Zappa_-_Joe_s_Corsage_(2004)_[EAC-FLAC]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9280442/Frank_Zappa_-_Joe_s_Corsage_(2004)_[EAC-FLAC]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFrank Zappa - Joe's Domage (2004) [EAC-FLAC]:\n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9298888/Frank_Zappa_-_Joe_s_Domage_(2004)_[EAC-FLAC]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9298888/Frank_Zappa_-_Joe_s_Domage_(2004)_[EAC-FLAC]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFrank Zappa - Joe's XMasage (2005) [EAC-FLAC]:\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9309564/Frank_Zappa_-_Joe_s_XMasage_(2005)__[EAC-FLAC]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9309564/Frank_Zappa_-_Joe_s_XMasage_(2005)__[EAC-FLAC]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n Enjoy, SEED and SHARING...
