Especially when that someone is Betty Corrigall, the Orcadian girl who in the 17702s killed herself having been cast out by her village after becoming pregnant by a visiting sailor?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nIn January 2011, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the spark that led Orcadian singer-songwriter Erland Cooper to group together his Erland &amp; The Carnival band mate Simon Tong and singer/orchestral arranger Hannah Peel (of last yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s solo The Broken Wave album) to form a new group, The Magnetic North, with a distinct purpose: the recording of Ã¢â‚¬ËœOrkney: Symphony Of The Magnetic NorthÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ, a new album due for an early May release on Full Time Hobby.\nBetty Corrigall was quite specific, handing Cooper a list of track names based on places in Orkney (beaches Rackwick and Warbeth, sea port Stromness, the rock formation Old man of Hoy etc) and even playing him some snippets from the finished album. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It seemed he had no choice but to follow orders and make the record,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Tong.\nThe resulting project took Cooper, Peel and Tong from South London to the far, far north, the Orkney Islands themselves. Setting up a portable studio in the living room of ErlandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ old house on the Stromness harbour front, they wrote and recorded songs overlooking the forbidding Atlantic Ocean. At the Hoy Kirk (church), they recorded with the Stromabank Pub Choir, which comprises almost half of the Isle Of HoyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s population, and Cooper recorded vocals in Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Dwarfie StaneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, a huge neolithic rock on Hoy with a person-sized chamber hollowed out inside. Ã¢â‚¬Å“A crazy English spy/soldier called Guilemus Mounsey stayed a few nights there alone in the 19th century and went loopy,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Cooper. Ã¢â‚¬Å“He carved his thoughts in Persian on the walls of the chamber.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nImmersing themselves in Orcadian folklore, poetry and geography, the trio were guided by a 1930s book titled Orkney: The Magnetic North, which seemed to lend itself perfectly to the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s title.\n\ncd ripped by X lossless decoder\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/03/25/the-magnetic-north/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/03/25/the-magnetic-north/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14dc04a568b873954b3b60ab871829063b625c2c","amp;dn":"The+Magnetic+North...Orkney+Symphony+Of+The+Magnetic+North%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14dc04a568b873954b3b60ab871829063b625c2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,220,4,165,104,184,115,149,75,59,96,171,135,24,41,6,59,98,92,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
