Marty is barely a friend any more, and the roommate from hell is doing Naked Guy on my couch again. It's bad enough that it feels like my life is coming apart at the seams. There's one man that has held it together for the past few weeks, but things change. All it takes is a few words and everything shatters. \n\nThe Arrangement 11: Sean Ferro is my addiction. I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t tell him no, no matter what he asks for, and I know there are so many dark questions behind those blue eyes, so many things he wants me to do with him. \n\nWhen I watch him go down on one knee, with his sexy body covered in sand, and hold up a glittering ring, I can barely stand. It looks like heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to propose, and I know exactly what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m going to say.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46fa2770e53d3aecbcafc56d3d88bd84161cffd0","amp;dn":"The+Arrangement+Series+by+H.M.+Ward+%28The+Arrangement+8+%26amp%3B+11%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46fa2770e53d3aecbcafc56d3d88bd84161cffd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,250,39,112,229,61,58,236,188,175,197,109,61,136,189,132,22,28,255,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
