All aspects from building the baseboard to scenery and basic operation are covered.\n\nIan explains how to lay the track, connect it up and make it look more realistic. He shows how to create hills, roads and greenery to provide a scenic setting for your trains. With the addition of a backscene and detail items the layout is then transformed into a realistic scene.\n\nThe disc also includes two &quot;pdf&quot; files to be read on your home computer. These will give you even more details and in-depth coverage of the topics. They explain how you can operate trains realistically. and also show the construction of a second layout.\n\nThis DVD does not assume any prior knowledge and makes a perfect introduction to the fascinating and rewarding hobby of railway modelling.\n Among the topics covered in detail are:\n\n Contents of the DVD\n\n Making Choices\n Building the Baseboard\n Getting Started\n Planning the Layout\n Wiring the Layout\n Laying the Track\n Painting the Track\n Ballasting\n Scenery\n Footpaths and Roads,\n Laying Grass\n Building the Platform\n Coarse Turf\n Detailing the Station. \n\n[b]Important: Resolution = 768 x 576. However, I have encoded these from 8GB to a reasonable uploading size, so there will be the odd loss of definition here and there.\nI used the H265 format, so if you have difficulty playing this file I suggest you download a media player like VLC.[/b]\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20bc9650fc9fcf6cccadb266e1f88312a4b203fc","amp;dn":"Model+Railways+-+Right+Track+Intro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20bc9650fc9fcf6cccadb266e1f88312a4b203fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,188,150,80,252,159,207,108,204,173,178,102,225,248,131,18,164,178,3,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
