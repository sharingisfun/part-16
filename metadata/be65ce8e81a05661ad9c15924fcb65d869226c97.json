HTML5 for Web Designers is 85 pages and fun to read. Easy choice.\n\nHTML5 is the longest HTML specification ever written. It is also the most powerful, and in some ways, the most confusing. What do accessible, content-focused standards-based web designers and front-end developers need to know? And how can we harness the power of HTML5 in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s browsers?\n\nIn this brilliant and entertaining userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guide, Jeremy Keith cuts to the chase, with crisp, clear, practical examples, and his patented twinkle and charm.\n\nContents:\n- A Brief History of Markup\n- The Design of HTML5\n- Rich Media\n- Web Forms 2.0\n- Semantics\n- Using HTML5 Today\n\nAbout the Author\nJeremy Keith is an Irish web developer living in Brighton, England, where he works with the web consultancy firm Clearleft. He has written two previous books, DOM Scripting and Bulletproof Ajax, but what he really wants to do is direct. His online home is adactio.com and his latest project is Huffduffer, a service for creating podcasts of found sounds. When heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not making websites, Jeremy plays bouzouki in the band Salter Cane. His loony bun is fine benny lava.\n\nBook Details\nPaperback: 96 pages\nPublisher: A Book Apart (2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0984442502\nISBN-13: 978-0984442508","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be65ce8e81a05661ad9c15924fcb65d869226c97","amp;dn":"HTML5+For+Web+Designers+V413HAV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be65ce8e81a05661ad9c15924fcb65d869226c97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,101,206,142,129,160,86,97,173,156,21,146,79,203,101,216,105,34,108,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
