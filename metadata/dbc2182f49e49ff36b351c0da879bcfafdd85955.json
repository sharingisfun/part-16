There's no complicated setup; just install Growl once and your apps can start displaying notifications right away.\nEverything in one place.\nGrowl centralizes all your notification preferences into its preferences - you can control them all from one place, and you know exactly how they are going to behave.\nKnow what happened while you were away.\nKeeps working even when you are not. Come back to your mac and review what happened while you were gone with Rollup.
