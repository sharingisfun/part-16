So Steph built walls long before she truly understood why and thought she was protecting herself by using sex as a weapon.\n\nBut by 37, she realized that her own self-destructive behavior wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t protecting her at all. All it did was prevent her from ever getting close to anyone.\n\nReady to remake herself with a new job, the challenge isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the work, but rather creating her new identity and trying to be the person she wants to be. Unlearning everything she ever knew is difficult, but it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t compare to the news that her mother and best friend has cancer.\n\nThe diagnosis creates a new reality for both Steph and Barb.\nTheir quality time goes from shopping and errands to a gut-wrenching maze of procedures, hospitalizations and suffering. Like with anything else, they tackle it the only way they know how: together.\n\nThe disease not only gives Steph perspective, it also introduces her to her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prick of an oncologist, Dr. Brad Rosenberg.\nPerhaps because she recognizes a broken soul when she sees one, Steph begins to slowly let Brad in.\n\nTheir budding relationship isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t without hurdles, but dealing with BarbÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illness accelerates the changes in StephÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own life. If only it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take losing her mother to start finding herself.\n\nGenre: Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b51d8786f2d8eafb436ff7c931ca8f60ababc61","amp;dn":"Better+Than+None+by+Olivia+Jake","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b51d8786f2d8eafb436ff7c931ca8f60ababc61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,81,216,120,111,45,142,175,180,54,255,124,147,28,168,246,10,186,188,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
