Ella&amp;#039;s unique vocal abilities enabled her to perform vocal gymnastics and athletics as easily as breathing. Whisper Not gives us an incredible track set that showcases Ella&amp;#039;s fine talents and the arrangements by Marty Paich complement Ella&amp;#039;s vocals to a tee!\n\nThe CD set opens with &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown.&quot; The horns start with quite a flourish and Ella comes in with her voice in perfect form. Ella&amp;#039;s voice is rich, warm and vibrant. Ella scats and romps through the octaves to make this number really swing. The number becomes even more electric as it progresses; you will like &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown.&quot;\n\nThe set continues with &quot;Whisper Not.&quot; Ella sings this romantic ballad with passion and sensitivity. Ella&amp;#039;s voice gets the spotlight instead of sharing it with the musicians as it did on &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown.&quot; Ella&amp;#039;s excellent diction bolsters her performance; and she scats a bit, too. &quot;Thanks For The Memory&quot; features Ella singing this classic number in a soft, sweet, and supple style that glows like gold. Ella begins this number in the spotlight but she eventually shares it with the musicians. Marty Paich&amp;#039;s arrangement works well.\n\n&quot;Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most&quot; is a pensive, melancholy ballad that Ella treats carefully. Ella&amp;#039;s vocals convey sensitivity as she jumps through an octave or two and Ella plays with the tempo of her vocals just a bit. &quot;Old MacDonald&quot; gets Ella&amp;#039;s usual fine treatment; but I doubt &quot;Old MacDonald&quot; is the best choice for this album. Yes, &quot;Old MacDonald&quot; is a breakneck jazzy number; but I suspect that it may have also been thrown in for a little shock effect!\n\n&quot;You&amp;#039;ve Changed&quot; gives us as a romantic, slow tempo ballad with a distinctly melancholy mood that Ella delivers with panache and sensitivity as she sings her heart out. &quot;Lover Man (Oh Where Can You Be)&quot; is another melancholy number that Ella massages to make this her own. Ella may sing &quot;Lover Man (Oh Where Can You Be)&quot; without too many vocal tricks but make no mistake about it--Ella&amp;#039;s interpretation of &quot;Lover Man&quot; reigns supreme.\n\nThe CD ends on an upbeat note with &quot;Matchmaker&quot; from &quot;Fiddler On The Roof.&quot; The melody is infectiously catchy and there&amp;#039;s just enough of a girlish quality in Ella&amp;#039;s voice to convey a young woman&amp;#039;s desire to marry the man of her dreams. The big band style arrangement by Marty Paich uses horns, percussion and drums to carry the bulk of the melody; and this works well. Ella&amp;#039;s hopeful attitude makes this a strong ending for the album.\n\nThe liner notes include the original liner notes by Leonard Feather; and the cover artwork reflects good taste.\n\nElla Fitzgerald remains a true star in the entertainment world; and I doubt that we&amp;#039;ll ever see another star quite like her. When the CD ends you want more just as Ella&amp;#039;s audiences always wanted more after her concerts. We still reap the benefits of having Ella give her gifts to us; and anyone who enjoys Ella or classic jazz vocals will be charmed by this CD.\n\nPersonnel:\nTracks 3-6\nElla Fitzgerald - Vocals\nHarry Edison - Trumpet\nJimmy Rowles - Piano\nChuck Berghofer - Bass\nLouie Bellson - Drums\nMarty Paich - Arranger, Conductor.\n\nTracks 1-2, 7-12\nElla Fitzgerald - Vocals\nStu Williamson - Trumpet\nBill Perkins - Tenor Saxophone\nJimmy Rowles - Piano\nAl Viola - Guitar\nJoe Mondragon - Bass\nShelly Manne - Drums\nMarty Paich - Arranger, Conductor\n\nRecorded July 20, 1966 at United Western Recorders, Hollywood, Los Angeles\n\nTrack listing:\n1.
