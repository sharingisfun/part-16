WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your predicament: breakfast on a harried school morning? The Mom 100Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s got itÃ¢â‚¬â€Personalized Pizzas are not only fast but are nutritious, and hey, it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get any better than pizza for breakfast. Kids making noise about the same old lunch? The Mom 100Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s got itÃ¢â‚¬â€three different Turkey Wraps, plus a Wrap Blueprint delivers enough variety to last for years.\nKatie Workman, founding editor in chief of Cookstr.com and mother of two school-age kids, offers recipes, tips, techniques, attitude, and wisdom for staying happy in\nthe kitchen while proudly keeping it homemadeÃ¢â‚¬â€because homemade not only tastes best, but is also better (and most economical) for you. The Mom 100 is 20 dilemmas every mom faces, with 5 solutions for each: including terrific recipes for the vegetable-averse, the salad-rejector, for the fish-o-phobe, or the overnight vegetarian convert. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fork-in-the-RoadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ variations make it easy to adjust a recipe to appeal to different eaters (i.e., the kids who want bland and the adults who donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t). Ã¢â‚¬Å“What the Kids Can DoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sidebars suggest ways for kids to help make each dish.\n\nAbout the Author\nKatie Workman was a kid who loved to cook, and a kid who loved cookbooks.
