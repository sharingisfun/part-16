IraQ&amp;Apos;s Insurgency and the Road to Civil Conflict is Anthony Cordesman's latest assessment of the Iraqi conflict and documents its entire evolution, from the history of ethnic tensions through the current U.S. surge. He identifies each actor in the arena, analyzes their motivations, and presents a detailed record of their actions, tactics, and capabilities. Cordesman's exhaustive study, based on meticulous research, is the most thorough account of the war to date.\n\nBeginning with the consequences of imperial colonialism and touching upon the ethnic tensions throughout SaddaM&amp;Apos;s regime, Cordesman examines and details the confluence of forces and events that have paved the way toward IraQ&amp;Apos;s current civil conflict. He analyzes major turning points, including elections, economic developments, and key incidents of violence that continue to shape the war. Finally, he outlines the lessons learned from this history and what can and cannot be done to stabilize the nation.\n\n\nBook Description\n\nDocuments the entire evolution of the Iraqi conflict from its historical roots through the latest U.S strategy to stabilize Baghdad.\nAbout the Author\nAnthony H.
