It has developed a huge cult following ever since.\n\n  It is the zaney story of a mild mannered, conservative couple who dream of opening a Restaurant in the country, only to see their dream thwarted by the crude, vulgar and insensitive people around them (Swingers). They stumble upon a scheme (and a &quot;Frying Pan&quot;) that will both rid society of this scum, and at the same time raise money for their dream.\n\n  Warning: This Movie is R-Rated. Due to nudity, sexual situations and language. (Nothing hardcore).\n\n  Starring: Paul Bartel, Mary Waronov, Robert Beltran, Susan Saiger.\n\n  Directed by: Paul Bartel.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 23min.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid DVD Rip.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 480.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b936d6eb587a4787d97ffc9e0acc2c7f460a5a9","amp;dn":"Eating+Raoul+%281982%29+AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b936d6eb587a4787d97ffc9e0acc2c7f460a5a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,147,109,110,181,135,164,120,125,151,255,201,224,172,194,199,244,96,165,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
