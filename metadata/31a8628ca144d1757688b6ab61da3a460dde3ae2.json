It was their first album released on the major label Atlantic Records (although that label re-released the previous album, Recipe for Hate) and also its last release with guitarist Brett Gurewitz, who left just prior to the 1994-1995 world tour and would return to the band seven years later. On tour, Gurewitz was replaced by Brian Baker, who would stay with the band permanently.\n\nWith sales continuing sixteen years after its release, Stranger Than Fiction is one of Bad Religion's most successful albums, featuring two of their well-known hit singles, &quot;Infected&quot; and the re-recorded version of &quot;21st Century (Digital Boy)&quot;, which both earned airplay on MTV and radio stations, such as KROQ. The album included one more hit single, &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot;, though the last one, &quot;Incomplete&quot;, failed to make any national chart. As of 2009, Stranger Than Fiction remains the only Bad Religion record to obtain gold status in the United States.\n\nFormat: CD\nReleased: 1994\nLabel: Atlantic\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Punk\nQuality: FLAC\n\nTracks:\n\n   1.
