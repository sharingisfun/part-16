Providing in-depth descriptions of how audio really works, using common sense plain-English explanations and mechanical analogies with minimal math, the book is written for people who want to understand audio at the deepest, most technical level, without needing an engineering degree. It's presented in an easy-to-read, conversational tone, and includes more than 400 figures and photos augmenting the text.\n\nThe Audio Expert takes the intermediate to advanced recording engineer or audiophile and makes you an expert. The book goes far beyond merely explaining how audio &quot;works.&quot; It brings together the concepts of audio, aural perception, musical instrument physics, acoustics, and basic electronics, showing how they're intimately related. Describing in great detail many of the practices and techniques used by recording and mixing engineers, the topics include video production and computers. Rather than merely showing how to use audio devices such as equalizers and compressors, Ethan Winer explains how they work internally, and how they are spec'd and tested. \n\nMost explanations are platform-agnostic, applying equally to Windows and Mac operating systems, and to most software and hardware. TheAudioExpertbook.com, the companion website, has audio and video examples to better present complex topics such as vibration and resonance. There are also videos demonstrating editing techniques and audio processing, as well as interviews with skilled musicians demonstrating their instruments and playing techniques. \n\n* Explains clearly the innermost details of audio hardware and software * Contains numerous practical tips, tricks, advice, and lots of myth-busting * Provides videos and audio examples on the companion website for comprehensive understanding\n\n\nBy Ethan Winer\nPublished by Focal Press in 2012\nEPUB, Retail, 696 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48633a039145d3df1841c9a0b3a52143d8e85665","amp;dn":"The+Audio+Expert+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48633a039145d3df1841c9a0b3a52143d8e85665","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,99,58,3,145,69,211,223,24,65,201,160,179,165,33,67,216,232,86,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
