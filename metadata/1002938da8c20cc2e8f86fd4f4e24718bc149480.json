The dood is a legend.\n\n- Big Papi[/i]\n\n[quote]By F. Hagan \n\nMore than half of one of the greatest comedy teams of all time, more than a Rat Packer, and more than the host of a highly rated variety show, the man who made a tuxedo look as comfortable as a t-shirt: Dean Martin was the substance of cool. The Essential Dean Martin (Capitol) stands out among other greatest hits collections, in that it combines the Capitol and Reprise hit singles into one stunning package of memorable excellence. The liner notes and accompanying booklet studied alone are a treasure, with words from Stevie Van Zandt and Dean's children Deanna and Gail, the release dates for each song and its peak chart position, and the obligatory black &amp; white photos of the master song stylist himself.\n\nIt's safe to say that it's all here, from the recognizable standard to some of the most sought after ballads. From the beautiful and hard to find waltz &quot;Under the Bridges of Paris&quot; to the quintessential rumba &quot;Sway,&quot; listening to Dean's velvety, smooth vocals is only pure joy. At a time when rock n' roll ruled the charts, Dean was slipping through gems like &quot;That's Amore,&quot; and attaching his name forever to Italian themed hits like &quot;Volare&quot; and &quot;Inamorata.&quot; Dean was charming and swinging with &quot;Ain't That a Kick in the Head&quot; and &quot;You're nobody `Til Somebody Loves You.&quot; He knocked the Beatles off of #1 with &quot;Everybody Loves Somebody,&quot; and swept the girls away with love songs like &quot;Return to Me&quot; and &quot;I'll Always Love You.&quot; Western styled selections from the 60's are here as well, like &quot;Houston,&quot; and &quot;Gentle on My Mind.&quot; Truly, from &quot;Powder Your Face With Sunshine&quot; to &quot;Just In Time,&quot; this is a wonderful starting place for a new fan of Dean, or a great summation of his career for a loyal follower. There's a comforting spirit of truth and optimism in the relaxed styling of a man who was the world's coolest crooner. This is the Dean Martin collection to own, for its diversity, its history, and its warm and tipsy dedication to the handsome tan man in the tuxedo.[/quote]\n\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/15/891/ei5r3vlo2Y.jpg[/img]\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nDean Martin - Dino: The Essential Dean Martin (Capitol 72435-98487-2 3)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Dean Martin\nAlbum................: Dino: The Essential Dean Martin (Capitol 72435-98487-2 3)\nGenre................: Vocal\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2004 06 01\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 47 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
