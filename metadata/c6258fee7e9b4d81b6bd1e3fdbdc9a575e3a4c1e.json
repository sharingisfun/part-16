A mysterious anarchist named &quot;V&quot; works to destroy the totalitarian government, profoundly affecting the people he encounters.\n\nThe series is set in a near-future Britain after a limited nuclear war, which has left much of the world destroyed. In this future, an extreme fascist party called Norsefire has arisen and is now the ruling power. &quot;V&quot;, an anarchist revolutionary dressed in a Guy Fawkes mask, begins an elaborate, violent and theatrical campaign to bring down the government.\n\nThis book, while read somewhat drably, is a wonderful adaptation from its original graphic novel and screenplay. The detail and description of the reading allows you to truly understand where they were trying to go with the film. If you haven&amp;#039;t read it, seen it, or simply would like to give it a shot...in my humble opinion this title was far underrated.\n\n~L","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6258fee7e9b4d81b6bd1e3fdbdc9a575e3a4c1e","amp;dn":"V+for+Vendetta+-+Audiobook+by+Steve+Moore+%28RARE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6258fee7e9b4d81b6bd1e3fdbdc9a575e3a4c1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,37,143,238,126,155,77,129,182,189,30,63,219,220,154,87,94,58,76,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
