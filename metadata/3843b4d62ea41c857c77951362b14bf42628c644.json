I want to share this with the torrent community's population of those interested in opiates, drugs, addiction, etc. If you download this, please seed for as long as you can. I want this movie to be available any time so please do what you can to keep this torrent alive. Thanks guys. \n\nAlso, don't show this film to people who are very impressionable or judgemental, as we don't need anymore exposure than we have to have already. Don't want anybody to end up in the emergency room or stupid shit like that so please show discretion in who you choose to share this with. Otherwise, enjoy, this has the best shots I've ever seen of real-life poppies so its definitely something to hold onto.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3843b4d62ea41c857c77951362b14bf42628c644","amp;dn":"Poppies%3A+Odyssey+of+an+Opium+Eater","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3843b4d62ea41c857c77951362b14bf42628c644","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,67,180,214,46,164,28,133,124,119,149,19,98,177,75,244,38,40,198,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
