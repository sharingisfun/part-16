Not only is her music authentically traditional, but in her mid-twenties Smith has the lyrical wherewithal to perform mostly original material. She was named BBC Young Traditional Musician of the Year in 2002 and is the only winner of the USA Songwriting Competition in 2005.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/02/03/emily-smith/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:349bcfe2e71e35fbb18282fc47269434543abf6f","amp;dn":"Emily+Smith...A+Different+Life%282004%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"349bcfe2e71e35fbb18282fc47269434543abf6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,155,207,226,231,30,53,251,177,130,130,252,71,38,148,52,84,58,191,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
