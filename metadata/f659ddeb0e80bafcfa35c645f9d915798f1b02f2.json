I\\'d goes as far as to say it\\'s going to be the most unique film put out this year. The purpose of this film is hilarious in itself. According to the narrator THE CRAP KEEPER (played by Lloyd Kaufman, he better get an oscar nod for costume design) this movie was designed from the remains of two awful films they had made. As awesome as Troma is rather than putting out 2 boring BAD films they decided to make it one kicka** double feature. A double feature like no other, the adr work, narration, editing, and BONER-VISION make this one of Troma\\'s finest gems. Lots of people will probably disagree, but these people have been cinematically brain washed. I enjoyed it more than Citizen Toxie, it was more from the hip, looser, as though it was pure creative freedom. Lloyd is the king of this stuff, he hasn\\'t hung up his hat like Waters and so many others, he keeps exploring far away from the realms of safety.\n\n\nSCREENS:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img3.imageshack.us/img3/7845/vlcsnap2010110514h58m32.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img3.imageshack.us/img3/7845/vlcsnap2010110514h58m32.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img248.imageshack.us/img248/6572/vlcsnap2010110515h01m39.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img248.imageshack.us/img248/6572/vlcsnap2010110515h01m39.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img135.imageshack.us/img135/479/vlcsnap2010110515h02m39.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img135.imageshack.us/img135/479/vlcsnap2010110515h02m39.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img825.imageshack.us/img825/1811/vlcsnap2010110515h03m31.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img825.imageshack.us/img825/1811/vlcsnap2010110515h03m31.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img219.imageshack.us/img219/8809/vlcsnap2010110515h08m34.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img219.imageshack.us/img219/8809/vlcsnap2010110515h08m34.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSEED AND ENJOY FOLKS!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f659ddeb0e80bafcfa35c645f9d915798f1b02f2","amp;dn":"Tales+From+The+Crapper+%282004%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f659ddeb0e80bafcfa35c645f9d915798f1b02f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,89,221,235,14,128,186,252,250,53,198,69,249,217,21,121,143,27,2,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
