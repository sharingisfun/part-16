The album takes songs from six of the band's seven full-lengths (only the seldom-heard Ignition is skipped), and includes&quot;Self Esteem&quot; and &quot;Gotta Get Away,&quot; from Smash, &quot;The Kids Aren't Alright,&quot; from Americana, and &quot;Jennifer Lost the War&quot; from The Offspring. Maybe it's the simple but catchy hooks and lyrics, maybe it's the teenage angst that Dexter Holland captured so well, but for whatever reason, The Bluegrass Tribute to the Offspring ends up being rather, and unexpectedly, enjoyable. ~ Marisa Brown, All Music Guide. \n\nPlease help SEED &amp; RATE for the next downloader.\n\nThanks &amp; Enjoy,\n(Strgazer)\n \n\nTrack\t Duration\t\n\n1\t All I Want\t         3:04\t\n2\t Self Esteem\t         3:42\t\n3\t Want You Bad\t         3:56\t\n4\t The Kids Aren't Alright 3:40\t\n5\t Gone Away\t         3:51\t\n6\t Gotta Get Away\t         3:58\t\n8\t Can't Repeat\t         4:00\t\n9\t Staring at the Sun\t 3:05\t\n10\t Hit That\t         3:28\t\n11\t Something to Believe In 3:50","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb590ab586da6fe1693768052c1223aaf37f274c","amp;dn":"Bluegrass+Tribute+to+the+Offspring-Americana","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb590ab586da6fe1693768052c1223aaf37f274c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,89,10,181,134,218,111,225,105,55,104,5,44,18,35,170,243,127,39,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
