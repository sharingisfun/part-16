Meaning, it's like a box, with video and audio inside it. How you use what is inside the box greatly depends on what is inside it. I used MKV because of how easy it is to include multiple audio tracks. Trying to use MP4 presented great difficulty. \n\n\n\nHow do i play these?!\nAs mentioned above, these videos are MKV contained x264 video and AAC audio. Now how you play them is up to you. \nOption 1: I personally use KMplayer, its cool looking, and plays almost any codec out there with no other filters or downloads. Much like VLC, except it looks cool. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.free-codecs.com/download/kmplayer.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.free-codecs.com/download/kmplayer.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOption 2: Install VLC, which plays almost anything.\nhttp://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html\n\nOption 3: Install ffdshow mpeg-4 decoder and haali splitter, that combo will let you play these in windows media player. Downside is that you can't switch audio tracks.\nhttp://www.free-codecs.com/download/FFDShow.htm\nhttp://www.free-codecs.com/download/Haali_Matroska_Splitter.htm\n\n\n\nI dont use windows, i use mac OSX!\nWell, ok, good for you. Go buy the dvd's then.\nj/k, you have options too...\nOption 1: Install VLC....lets you switch audio tracks.\n[code]http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html[/code]\nOption 2: Or if you are obsessed with mac programs as many mac enthusiest are, you can install a quicktime component called perian. It will allow you to play MKV along with other containers/codecs natively in quicktime. Downside is again...that you can't switch audio tracks.\nhttp://perian.org/#download\n\n\n\nIf you use linux, then you should well know how to encode video, and don't need help.\n\n\n\nHow do i switch audio tracks to listen to the commentary track?\nWell in windows media player, and quicktime, you can't.\n\nKMplayer:\nRight click anywhere on the video&gt;Audio&gt;Stream Selection&gt;then select track\nAlternatively, if you can remember it, ctrl+X will switch through audio tracks.\n\n\nVLC:\nAudio&gt;Audio Track&gt;Track 2\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36de4c687f869b8de05bc425522576ee7085237a","amp;dn":"Chappelles+show+%2B+standup+acts+%2B+dvd+extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36de4c687f869b8de05bc425522576ee7085237a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,222,76,104,127,134,155,141,224,91,196,37,82,37,118,238,112,133,35,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
