It was first published in Mexico in 1950, by Talleres GrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ficos de la NaciÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n. Neruda began to compose it in 1938.\n\n&quot;Canto General&quot; consists of 15 sections, 231 poems, and more than 15,000 lines. This work attempts to be a history or encyclopedia of the whole continent of Hispanic America.\n\n\nThe &quot;Canto General&quot; was intoned by several musicians. The best known intonation is by Mikis Theodorakis, a leftist composer and politician from Greece; the vocals in the original recording are by Maria Farantouri and Petros Pandis, who both sang in Spanish language. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCD 1\n\n01.
