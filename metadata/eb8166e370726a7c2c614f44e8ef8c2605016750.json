Recent attempted attacks like the Times Square bombing, the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œunderwear bombingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on a flight over Detroit, and the attack on a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Oregon were all isolated plots that failed anyway. In the words of Homeland Security secretary Janet Napolitano, &quot;The system worked.&quot;\n\nDon't believe it. In The Terrorist Next Door, investigative reporter Erick Stakelbeck exposes the staggering truth about our national security: the Obama administration is concealing and whitewashing the enormous terrorist threat growing right here within AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s borders.\n\nIf you believe terrorism is only a problem for other countries, Stakelbeck's on-the-ground reporting will open your eyes. He has been inside America's radical mosques, visited U.S.-based Islamic enclaves, and learned about our enemies by going straight to the source--interviewing al-Qaeda-linked terrorists themselves. In this shocking book, Stakelbeck reveals:\n\n* How Islamic radicals have established separatist compounds and even jihadist training camps throughout rural America\n* That an overt disciple of Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini now leads one of the largest mosques in America\n* How mega-mosques aren't just planned for Ground Zero--they're being built in the heart of the Bible Belt as part of a plan for Islamic domination\n* What a former U.S. covert agent inside the Iranian regime says about Iran's program to recruit Americans into terror groups\n* How the Obama administration's beguiling counter-terrorism policies are increasing the threat of another 9/11\n\nThe Terrorist Next Door sounds the alarm on a growing threat to every American--one that the U.S. government refuses to face honestly or even to name. As we struggle against a relentless and adaptable Islamist enemy that is committed to destroying our nation, we can't say we weren't warned.\n\nAuthor: Erick Stakelbeck\nPublisher: Regnery Publishing\nPublication Date: May 2, 2011\n\nFormats:\n.mobi (compatible with Amazon Kindle, etc.)\n.epub (compatible with Sony Reader, Cruz Reader, iPad, iPodTouch/iPhone, etc.)\n\nFree Calibre eBook reader: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb8166e370726a7c2c614f44e8ef8c2605016750","amp;dn":"Erick+Stakelbeck+-+The+Terrorist+Next+Door+%28mobi%2C+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb8166e370726a7c2c614f44e8ef8c2605016750","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,129,102,227,112,114,106,124,44,97,79,68,232,239,140,38,5,1,103,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
