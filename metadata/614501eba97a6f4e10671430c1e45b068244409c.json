He was married to six distinctly different women, and in this richly detailed and meticulously researched history, these remarkable, often misunderstood queens come to life once again: Katherine of Aragon, stubborn and devoutly Catholic; Anne Boylen, proud and fiercely ambitious; Jane Seymour, deceptively strong-willed; Anne of Cleves, unappealing and uncomplaining; Katherine Howard, young and foolish and finally, Katherine Parr, brave, practical and intelligent. Their full histories and personalities emerge at last, giving voices to the six extraordinary women who left their distinctive marks on the English throne and thereby changed the course of British history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:614501eba97a6f4e10671430c1e45b068244409c","amp;dn":"The+Six+Wives+of+Henry+VIII.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"614501eba97a6f4e10671430c1e45b068244409c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,69,1,235,169,122,111,78,16,103,20,48,193,228,91,6,130,68,64,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
