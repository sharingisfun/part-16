Both rappers are former members of Project Wyze. Blood music is a re-upload of Bonescraper's work (with slightly modified/upgraded tags and file names), and The Throwaway Kids (minus the youtube extended version) came from kingdomleaks. All of these files have accurate (and matching) id3 tags, written by me.\n\nBlood Music\n-Intro                                                   (320 kb/s)\n-We Fall, We Fall (Ft.
