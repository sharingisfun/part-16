Is he dead? Is he alive? Why is everyone shooting at him? And when did he fall behind the strength portion of the battle of the sexes?\n\nThere are nothing but questions for Luck until a little, green, shape-shifting alien appears and changes his life forever. Now, with the help of Decoy, he can rid the world of crime - including Nabob, who wants to take over the world.\n\nNow Luck and Decoy must depend on each other for survival and along with Luck's senior partner, Tessa Moreno, they must stop Nabob from taking over the city - all while keeping Decoy a secret. Who know who else would be after Luck if they knew he was harboring an alien?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e32134cbad189763133e0b2231ef15e71628ca3c","amp;dn":"Decoy+%282010%29+%28Digital%29+%28DR+%26amp%3B+Quinch-Empire%29.cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e32134cbad189763133e0b2231ef15e71628ca3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,33,52,203,173,24,151,99,19,62,11,34,49,239,21,231,22,40,202,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
