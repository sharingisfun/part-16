To check out the rest of the Pimps News and whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coming in Alpha 9 read on.\n\n7 Days on Youtube\nThe popular YouTube Channel Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Achievement HuntersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ under the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rooster TeethÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ umbrella are doing a series on 7 Days to Die! Head on over to one of the first 2 videos and thumbs up it to show your support if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to see a regular series by these hilarious guys.\nLetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Play 7 Days to Die Part 1\nLetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Play 7 Days to Die Part 2\n\nAlpha 9 Status\nOk now for the news youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve all been waiting for. The word on the street is that the Pimps have decided to accelerate their Alpha 9 schedule shuffling a few features around moving some things forward and a few things back to post Alpha 9 to get you guys a kick ass new build sooner. If all goes well youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get it as soon as August 8th. Here are the planned features going in.\n\n    Randomly Generated Infinite Worlds which include all biomes types with custom elevations, lakes, natural deeper rivers, curvy roads, random locations, and a procedurally generated centralized wasteland city with some never before seen locations!\n    A kickass new AAA GUI with all new art including belt, backpack, character screen, map, friends list, new minimalist compass and player stats. The GUI also includes added functionality including our new data driven in game map system with fog of war, a searchable recipe list and friend compass tracking\n    New leg sprain, leg fracture, leg break and dysentery de-buff systems\n    Under water effects and drowning system\n    World improvements including decorations adhering to the terrain to altering what is found out and about while scavenging. All major prefabs have been given a container overhaul. We thinned out the cabinets and other things that can hold loot, but increased the odds that things will be found within them. This has the dual benefit of making longer scavenging ventures more profitable while not spreading too much more loot into the world as a whole.\n    And lastly if time permits watch out for our new Gore block system where zombie bodies decompose into bloody piles that stack up and can work in the zombies favor.\n\n\nDerpTeam Server IP:  DerpTeamGames.com  Port: 25000","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcfeb6f3622bc5584a2558bf1e7d8073c19254a7","amp;dn":"7+Days+To+Die+Alpha+8.8+%5BDerpTeam%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcfeb6f3622bc5584a2558bf1e7d8073c19254a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,254,182,243,98,43,197,88,74,37,88,191,30,125,128,115,193,146,84,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
