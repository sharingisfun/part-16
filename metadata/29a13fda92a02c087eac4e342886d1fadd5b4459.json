We learn about a new apology given by ESPN, talk Uzi's, Chelsea Handler leaving late night TV, and we catch a glimpse of Chip Chipperson. Chip then calls into the hotline, Ant takes a few more calls, and we end the show with a video that Nick DiPaolo suggested.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29a13fda92a02c087eac4e342886d1fadd5b4459","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-08-27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29a13fda92a02c087eac4e342886d1fadd5b4459","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,161,63,218,146,160,44,8,126,172,78,52,40,134,209,250,221,91,68,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
