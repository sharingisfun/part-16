But in 1971, the Louisiana native moved to Woodstock, New York and recorded an overlooked masterpiece that combines Charles' Cajun roots with R&amp;B and country influences on ten timeless tracks. Released in 1972 on Bearsville Records, Bobby Charles features Charles leading a session stacked with top-shelf talent, including Mac &quot;Dr. John&quot; Rebennack, pedal steel ace Ben Keith, guitarist Amos Garrett, saxophonist David Sanborn, as well as Levon Helm, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel, and Garth Hudson of The Band. This &quot;lost&quot; classic with a three-disc Deluxe Edition that combines a remastered version of the original with a wealth of unreleased material recorded during those sessions and others recorded at Bearsville Studios throughout 1974. The set closes with a newly unearthed, 30-minute interview Charles did that was recorded shortly before the Bobby Charles album was released in August 1972. Along with the original album, the first disc also features &quot;New Mexico,&quot; &quot;Homemade Songs,&quot; &quot;Rosie,&quot; and the single version of &quot;Small Town Talk&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ four songs that first surfaced on the now out-of-print import, Bearsville Box Set. Four unreleased tracks are also included on the first disc: &quot;Save Me Jesus,&quot; (mono single version); &quot;He's Got All The Whiskey&quot; (long version); &quot;Don't Be Surprised&quot; and &quot;You Were There.&quot; The set's second disc contains 17 tracks for more than an hour of unreleased music. It begins with four songs from the Bobby Charles sessions: take one of &quot;He's Got All The Whiskey&quot;; a demo for &quot;New Mexico&quot;; plus a pair of languid country shuffles Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;Homemade Songs&quot; and &quot;Done A Lot Of Worse Things&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that rank among Charles' finest work. The remainder of the disc gathers more than a dozen songs Charles recorded with producer Paul Rothchild at Bearsville Studio in 1974, including the New Orleans pop and R&amp;B of &quot;Better Days,&quot; &quot;Jealous Kind&quot; and &quot;Whatever Happened&quot; and the Southern funk of &quot;Please Please&quot; and &quot;Why Are People Like That.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2234e323289ae3d1756883e6a9edaac3a4bf400b","amp;dn":"Bobby+Charles+-+Bobby+Charles+%28Rhino+Handmade%29+v0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2234e323289ae3d1756883e6a9edaac3a4bf400b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,52,227,35,40,154,227,209,117,104,131,230,169,237,170,195,164,191,64,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
