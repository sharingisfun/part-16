Michael Caine plays an aging intelligence agent who picks up clues that the ingredients for such an apocalypse are being smuggled piece-by-piece into the U.K.--but he cannot seem to get his superiors to care. Caine is outstanding in a role that seems tailor-made for him, and Pierce Brosnan is very good as the Russian agent working undercover in England to effect the planned tragedy. The film perfectly captures a spreading suspicion and resentment toward superpower adventurism, even though such sentiments are, in fact, being exploited by the bad guys. Caine, as always, suggests a man walking a narrow line through a gauntlet of moral compromises.\n\nStarring: \nMichael Caine\nPierce Brosnan\n\nIMDB (The Internet Movie Database) link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093044/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093044/&lt;/a&gt;\n========================================================================\nThe best video/audio players to play movies are: \n\nFree DivX Player\nWindows:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.divx.com/divx/windows/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.divx.com/divx/windows/&lt;/a&gt; \nMac:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.divx.com/divx/mac/?cid=DP0000279&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.divx.com/divx/mac/?cid=DP0000279&lt;/a&gt; \n\nVLC (VideoLan) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.videolan.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.videolan.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe KM Player &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kmplayer.com/forums/showthread.php?t=4094&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kmplayer.com/forums/showthread.php?t=4094&lt;/a&gt;\n==========================================================================\nPlease be patient &amp; continue to share after your download completes. \nThe more who share, the faster everyone can get the file. \n\nTo all who post comments below: Thank you &amp; we appreciate your feedback.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cd87040d3035acbeaa3618fb5b2471ccf4d7691","amp;dn":"The+Fourth+Protocol+%5B1987-1h54m%5D%5BA+LordOfWar+Release%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cd87040d3035acbeaa3618fb5b2471ccf4d7691","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,216,112,64,211,3,90,203,234,163,97,143,181,178,71,28,207,77,118,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
