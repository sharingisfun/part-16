Company, the  livelihood of  its loyal\n        fleet  of salesmen  threatens to  go, as  they say,  into the\n        toilet.  Enter  estranged  daughter  Rosemary,  a   high-class\n        - cosmetics salesgirl,  who steps in  to take control.  She is\n        not sure she has  a nose for the  family business, but she  is\n        determined to make foul into profit. Little does she know that\n        a  ruthless,  slick-talking  fertilizer  rep  is  plotting   a\n        takeover. Whether she likes it or not, she must trust her  top\n        salesman,  Patrick Fitzpatrick,  to devise  a plan  to regain\n        Rose's rightful position on top of the heap.\n\n     \n                                           \n                      CAST                       \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n            Billy Bob Thornton       ....
