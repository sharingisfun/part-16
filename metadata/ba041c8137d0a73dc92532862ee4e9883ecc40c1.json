Schlesinger, Jr., chronicles the short life of the Kennedy family's second presidential hopeful in &quot;a story that leaves the reader aching for what cannot be recaptured&quot; (Miami Herald). Schlesinger's account vividly recalls the forces that shaped Robert Kennedy, from his position as the third son of a powerful Irish Catholic political clan to his concern for issues of social justice in the turbulent 1960s. ROBERT KENNEDY AND HIS TIMES is &quot;a picture of a deeply compassionate man hiding his vulnerability, drawn to the underdogs and the unfortunates in society by his life experiences and sufferings&quot; (Los Angeles Times).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba041c8137d0a73dc92532862ee4e9883ecc40c1","amp;dn":"Robert+Kennedy+and+His+Times","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba041c8137d0a73dc92532862ee4e9883ecc40c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,4,28,129,55,208,167,61,201,37,50,134,46,228,233,136,62,204,64,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
