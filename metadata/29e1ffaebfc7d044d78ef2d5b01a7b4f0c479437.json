With a program of seven Peterson originals plus the Ellington-Strayhorn standard, &quot;Satin Doll,&quot; this group cooks.  &quot;Backyard Blues&quot; and &quot;Nigerian Marketplace&quot; are especially exciting and contemporary-sounding originals, while &quot;When Summer Comes,&quot; &quot;Evening Song&quot; and &quot;Love Ballade&quot; are beautiful ballads.  Bassist Niels-Henning Oersted Pedersen lays down the nimble-fingered lines for which he is known, while guitarist Ulf Wakenius is a most complementary figure in dialogue with the leader.  Drummer Martin Drew keeps the proceedings on track rhythmically, taking a tasty solo turn on the set closer, &quot;Sushi.&quot; With this fine recording, Peterson shows that even in his seventies, he's still got the goods. ~ Jim Newsom, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nOscar Peterson (Piano) \nUlf Wakenius (Guitar) \nNiels Henning Oersted-Pedersen (Double Bass) \nMartin Drew (Drums) \n\nOscar Peterson - A Summer Night in Munich Tracks:\n01  Backyard Blues (Oscar Peterson) 7:06 \n02  When Summer Comes (Oscar Peterson) 9:16 \n03  Nigerian Marketplace (Oscar Peterson) 9:46 \n04  Evening Song (Oscar Peterson) 6:24 \n05  Satin Doll (Duke Ellington/Bill Strayhorn) 8:31 \n06  Love Ballade (Oscar Peterson) 8:58 \n07  Hymn to Freedom (Oscar Peterson) 6:00 \n08  Sushi (Oscar Peterson) 8:04\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29e1ffaebfc7d044d78ef2d5b01a7b4f0c479437","amp;dn":"Oscar+Peterson+-+A+Summer+Night+in+Munich+%281998%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29e1ffaebfc7d044d78ef2d5b01a7b4f0c479437","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,225,255,174,191,199,208,68,215,142,242,213,176,26,123,79,12,71,148,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
