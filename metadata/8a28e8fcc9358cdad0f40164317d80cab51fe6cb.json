His first two albums, &quot;Answering Machine Music&quot; and &quot;Pocket Symphonies for Lonely Subway Cars,&quot; were made using nothing but small, battery-operated keyboards and Ashworth&amp;#039;s own voice (along with occasional accompaniment by guest musicians). These early albums are now available on one CD, appropriately titled &quot;The First Two Albums by Casiotone for the Painfully Alone.&quot;\n\nAshworth has released numerous EPs and full-length albums, with a trademark austere lyrical style that conveys emotions through its simplicity and directness.\nCFTPA expanded its sound in 2006 with Ashworth&amp;#039;s newest release &amp;#039;Etiquette,&amp;#039; now using more instruments and effects (as well as more professional production and vocals from Jenny Herbinson). This album has given Ashworth room for experimentation and thinking space.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n-- alphabet series 7&amp;#039;&amp;#039; [2005]\n\n-- etiquette [2006]\n\n-- pocket symphonies for lonesome subway cars\n\n-- split 7&amp;#039;&amp;#039; w. fox pause [2005]\n\n-- twinkle echo [2003]\n\n-- young shields [2005]\n\n\nHappy Listening \n\n/Synthpopper","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a28e8fcc9358cdad0f40164317d80cab51fe6cb","amp;dn":"Casiotone+for+the+painfully+alone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a28e8fcc9358cdad0f40164317d80cab51fe6cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,40,232,252,201,53,140,218,208,244,1,100,49,125,128,202,181,31,230,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
