This is a hard-to-find CD that was only available at performances. This was ripped from a CD, so it is perfect audio quality. I was not able to find the album artwork on the internet, and may just have to scan my copy in.\n\nHope you enjoy, and please re-seed this rare CD!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83ed099f96e0860759128a6ffc7461a67ac0744f","amp;dn":"%5BWoody+Allen+Jazz+Music%5D+-+Davis%2C+Allen+%26+Fowkes+-+Woody+With+St","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83ed099f96e0860759128a6ffc7461a67ac0744f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,237,9,159,150,224,134,7,89,18,138,111,252,116,97,166,122,192,116,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
