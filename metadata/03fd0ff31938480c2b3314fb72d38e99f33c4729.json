With violinist StÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©phane Grappelli he cofounded the Quintette du Hot Club de France, described by critic Thom Jurek as &quot;one of the most original bands in the history of recorded jazz.&quot; Reinhardt's most popular compositions have become jazz standards, including &quot;Minor Swing&quot;, &quot;Tears&quot;, &quot;Belleville&quot;, &quot;Djangology&quot;, &quot;Swing '42&quot; and &quot;Nuages&quot; (French for &quot;Clouds&quot;).\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
