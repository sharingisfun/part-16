A controlled voice increases self-confidence and enhances charisma, approachability, and trustworthiness. Yet an astounding 30 percent of professionals develop preventable vocal problems that could ruin their careers. And most do not know that both the quality and tone of oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice can be changed.\n \nThe Voice Book: Caring For, Protecting, and Improving Your Voice is a one-of-a-kind reference that will save and improve your voice, your job, and your personal life. With dozens of vocal exercises and a detailed guide to the anatomy and physiology of voice, the book covers the full range of vocal health, from protecting against hoarseness and laryngitis to expanding speaking range and enhancing voice tone and quality.\n \nIllustrations, photographs, FAQs, and an accompanying CD make The Voice Book the first vocal self-help book of its kind and a must-read for anyone who wants a dependable, strong, and engaging voice.\n\n-\n\nBiography\nKate DeVore is a theatre voice/speech/dialect trainer, voice/speech pathologist, and Personal Development Coach.
