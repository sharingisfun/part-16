At the setting of the new Image Comics/Shadowline mini-series by Jimmie Robinson (BOMB QUEEN), FIVE WEAPONS, students train in the martial arts, pledging their loyalty to one &quot;club&quot;: Knives, Staves, Archery, Exotics, and Guns.\n\nThe School of Five Weapons is turned upside down when a new student arrives, one carrying a name that all the students and teachers know: Shainline. The clubs vie for Tyler's loyalty, but it becomes apparent very quickly that this kid isn't someone who is easy to pin down. Tyler has just the edge he needs to succeed at Five Weapons Ã¢â‚¬â€ a razor-sharp mind!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ac74869db91c14e1d841e67a11acc8a5582fdbe","amp;dn":"Five+Weapons+%28001+-+010%29+%282013+-+Ongoing%29+%28Digital%29+%28Son+of+Ultr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ac74869db91c14e1d841e67a11acc8a5582fdbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,199,72,105,219,145,193,78,29,132,30,103,161,26,204,138,85,130,253,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
