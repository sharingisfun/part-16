Indeed, it seems that each generation of whites and Indians will have to read and re-read Vine Deloria's Manifesto for some time to come, before we absorb his special, ironic Indian point of view and what he tells us, with a great deal of humor, about U.S. race relations, federal bureaucracies, Christian churches, and social scientists. This book continues to be required reading for all Americans, whatever their special interest.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nVine Deloria, Jr., Professor of Political Science at the University of Arizona, is the author of a number of books and articles on events affecting the lives of American Indians. He serves as the Executive Director of the National Congress of American Indians and is an active spokesman and leader for the American Indian community throughout the nation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2c1b0e6accea8a760e8022505e2245fa1b6cc6c","amp;dn":"Custer+Died+for+Your+Sins%3A+An+Indian+Manifesto+by+Vine+Deloria","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2c1b0e6accea8a760e8022505e2245fa1b6cc6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,193,176,230,172,206,168,167,96,232,2,37,5,226,36,95,161,182,204,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
