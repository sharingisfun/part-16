If you think that science is just another religion,\nthat religion is about our higher values, or that scientists are\njust as dogmatic as believers, then read this book and see if you\ncan counter Dawkins's arguments. They are passionately stated and\npoetically expressed but are rooted in reason and evidence.&quot;\n\n  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Steven Pinker, Johnstone Professor at Harvard University and\nauthor of The Language Instinct, How the Mind Works, and The Blank\nSlate\n\n&quot;Oh, it's so refreshing, after being told all your life that it is\nvirtuous to be full of faith, spirit, and superstition, to read\nsuch a resounding trumpet blast for truth instead. It feels like\ncoming up for air.&quot;\n\n  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Matt Ridley, author of Genome and Francis Crick\n\n----\n\nA preeminent scientistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and the world's most prominent\natheistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½asserts the irrationality of belief in God and the grievous\nharm religion has inflicted on society, from the Crusades to 9/11.\n\nWith rigor and wit, Dawkins examines God in all his forms, from the\nsex-obsessed tyrant of the Old Testament to the more benign (but\nstill illogical) Celestial Watchmaker favored by some Enlightenment\nthinkers. He eviscerates the major arguments for religion and\ndemonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows\nhow religion fuels war, foments bigotry, and abuses children,\nbuttressing his points with historical and contemporary evidence.\n\n----\n\nRichard Dawkins is the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public\nUnderstanding of Science at Oxford University. The New York Times\nBook Review has hailed him as a writer who &quot;understands the issues\nso clearly that he forces his reader to understand them too.&quot; His\nprevious books include The Ancestor's Tale, The Selfish Game, and\nThe Blind Watchmaker.\n\n----\n\nThe God Delusion is narrated by the author and Lalla Ward, who is\nbest known for her role on the popular Doctor Who series. She is\nthe wife of Richard Dawkins.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99c0da71fff805afcfe2dc66e7a230ddd7f8ffe6","amp;dn":"Richard+Dawkins+-+The+God+Delusion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99c0da71fff805afcfe2dc66e7a230ddd7f8ffe6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,192,218,113,255,248,5,175,207,226,220,102,231,162,48,221,215,248,255,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
