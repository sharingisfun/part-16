Aided by a TV advertising campaign it would become Purple's\nthird UK #1 album.\n\nIt was at one point the longest album ever released as a single LP, but it was overtaken by Def Leppard's Hysteria album in 1987.\n\nThis also marked the debut of &quot;Demon's Eye&quot; for the North American release, where it was replaced by &quot;Strange Kind of Woman&quot; on Fireball.\n\nAll songs from this album later appeared on Rhino's The Very Best of Deep Purple, along with 3 additional songs.\n\nA 30th Anniversary Edition (released in the UK, October 25th, 2010 and US, November 2nd, 2010) containing tracks from\nthe Mark 1 &amp; 4 eras have been introduced to the classic compilation, plus a bonus DVD containing previously\nunreleased video footage and an exclusive track by track commentary from founding member Jon Lord.\n\n\n\nDVD contents:\n\n\n01. - Hush\n02. - Speed King\n03. - Child In Time\n04. - Black Night\n05. - Fireball\n06. - Strange Kind Of Woman\n07. - Demon's Eye\n08. - Highway Star\n09. - Never Before\n10. - Smoke On The Water\n11. - Woman From Tokyo\n12. - Made in Japan (contains Space Truckin excerpt)\n13. - Burn\n14. - You Keep On Moving\n15. - Stormbringe\n\n\nLength: 1:39:44\nQuality: DVD 5\nFormat: DVD video\nVideo codec: MPEG2\nAudio Codec: AC3\nVideo: NTSC 16:9 720x480 bitrate 5-6 Mbps\nAudio: AC3 bitrate 256Kbps, 2ch\nFormat: MPEG-PS\nGenre: Music,Documentary,Biography\n\nVideo\n\nID: 224 (0xE0)\nFormat: MPEG Video\nFormat_Version: Version 2\nFormat_Profile: Main@Main\nFormat_Settings_BVOP/String: Yes\nFormat_Settings_GOP: M=2, N=15\nBit rate: 9 800 Kbps\n720 X 480 pixels\n16:9\nFrame rate: 29,970 fps\nStandard: NTSC\n8 bits\nColorimet: 4:2:0\nScanType/String: Interlaced\nScanOrder/String: Bottom Field First\nBits/(Pixel*Frame): 0.946\n\nAudio\n\nID: 128 (0x80)\nFormÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡t: AC-3\nFormÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡t/: Audio Coding 3\nFormat_Settings_ModeExtension: CM (complete main)\nBit rate: 256 Kbps\nChannels: 2\nChannel positions: Front: L R\nSampling rate: 48,0 KHz\n\n\n\n\n\nCD TrackList:\n\n\n01. - Black Night (Single Version)\n02. - Speed King\n03. - Fireball\n04. - Hush\n05. - Strange Kind of Woman\n06. - Child In Time\n07. - When a Blind Man Cries (1997 Remix)\n08. - Woman From Tokyo\n09. - Highway Star\n10. - Space Truckin'\n11. - Burn\n12. - Stormbringer\n13. - Soldier of Fortune\n14. - Demon's Eye\n15. - You Keep On Moving\n16. - Smoke On the Water\n\nCodec: Monkey's Audio (APE)\nVersion: Monkey v3.99\nQuality: Normal, (avg. compression: 158 %) 871 kbps\nChannels: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTime: 01:19:07\nSize: 493,18 MB\nGenre: Hard Rock\nCover: Yes(complete)\nCountry: United Kingdom\n\nUploaded by Matesio\nEnjoy &amp; Seed into a coma !!\nThanks Motivates\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:047dd78bcd7f011c23f41265d589b980195c4a13","amp;dn":"DEEP+PURPLE+-+Deepest+Purple+DVD+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"047dd78bcd7f011c23f41265d589b980195c4a13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,125,215,139,205,127,1,28,35,244,18,101,213,137,185,128,25,92,74,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
