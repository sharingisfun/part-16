With\nauthentic driver controls, you experience life in the cockpit with the same\ntechnological wizardry available to this seasonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Formula One racers, or\nswitch off the controls and rely on your raw driving skills. Take the\nwheel in F1 2002 and take aim at the 2002 Formula One World Championship.\n\nReal drivers, teams, cars, and tracks all taken straight from the actual\n2002 racing season, will once again make appearances. Aside from this,\nand all of the other options and nuances to make return appearances,\nF1 2002 will also include:\n\n\n* 2002 Season complete with new Toyota and Renault racing teams.\n\n* Telemetry based optimization of vehicle setup, driving style,\n  and performance.\n\n* New graphics technology that incorporates multi-texturing, dynamic\n  weather, real-world lighting, character and pit crew animations,\n  and &quot;6D physics&quot; (now including engine and brake temperature modeling).\n\n* Greater accessibility, automation, and controller compatibility.\n\n* As with practically all of EA's marquee sports franchises, yearly\n  iterations are but improvements upon the last efforts, and not\n  necessarily radical alterations to or departures from proven formulas.\n  And, as with practically all of EA's other marquee sports franchises,\n  this is usually a damn good thing. F1 2001 was an exercise in immense\n  satisfaction; I can only imagine 2002 will be the same, but better.\n\nUSE THIS SERIAL TO INSTALL:\n7931-9865028-6024865-1156\n\n\nExtract Archive With Winrar Or 7zip etc.........\n\nThen Mount Image Or Burn To CD\n\nInstall The Game And Play\n\n\nENJOY AND PLEASE SEED\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c04c5e3f38798ed8112fba8c84f04efc74e24e6d","amp;dn":"F1.2001.PC.Game%28djDEVASTATE%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c04c5e3f38798ed8112fba8c84f04efc74e24e6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,76,94,63,56,121,142,216,17,47,186,140,132,240,78,252,116,226,78,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
