She emerged a woman transformed, with an exquisite beauty found only in fairy tales. Nell Calder deserved a happy ending. Instead, her descent into terror has just begun.\n\nHer attacker is still on the hunt, determined to finish what he's started. And Nell, protected by a new face, is just as determined to fight back and take her revenge. But to catch her prey, she will have to expose herself--even if it makes her a killer's prime target.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a83d6e17e1156345a990529e52799061f139280","amp;dn":"The+Ugly+Duckling+-+Iris+Johansen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a83d6e17e1156345a990529e52799061f139280","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,131,214,225,126,17,86,52,90,153,5,41,229,39,153,6,31,19,146,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
