Later on, Miles retained Bill Evans and brought in his old drummer Al Foster, plus a group of New York-based musicians, to complete the rest of the album.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Man With The HornÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a mixed bag featuring three different bands and an eclectic mix of jazz-swing, funk, rock and disco. \n\n\nMiles Davis\n\nThe Man With The Horn\n\n1981\n\n\n  CD / 2006 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
