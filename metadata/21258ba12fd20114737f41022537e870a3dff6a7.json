Greenaway deals with his favourite themes of love, death, sexuality and especially the veneer the lies beneath feminism. The acting is consistently excellent and Joan Plowright, Juliet Stevenson and Joely Richardson are delightfully ghoulish in their scheming. As the story unfolds, the director indulges his love of numbers by literally counting sequentially from 1 to 100, the numbers appearing somewhere on screen. The film is elegantly scored by Michael Nyman and luminously shot in baroque colours by cinematographer Sacha Vierney.\nThe film follows the darkly murderous acts of three women three generations of women all named Cissie Colpitts; mother (Joan Plowright), daughter (Juliet Stevenson) and grad-daughter (Joely Richardson). The family have discovered the same way of dealing with their marital problems; drowning. The senior Cissie begins by drowning her adulterous husband Jake (Bryan Pringle) in a tin bath. An alibi is supplied by their friend the local coroner Madgett (Bernard Hill) who records the death as accidental.\nHer daughter dispatches her spouse Hardy (Trevor Cooper) to a watery grave whilst swimming in the sea, and the youngest Cissie drowns her husband Bellamy (David Morrissey) in the local swimming pool. Madgett continues to provide an alibi for the three women in the hope and expectation one will submit as promised to his sexual advances.\nAs the water-related body count grows the villagers become suspicious the trio are murdering the fallen husbands and that Madgett is supplying an alibi. Madgett decides to admit his part in the murders but his teenage sonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s (Jason Edwards) gameplaying instincts come to his aid. He organizes a game of tug-of-war between the townÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s accusers and the Colpitt women ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ with a river in the middle.\n\nThe Production Team\n\nDirector: Peter Greenaway \nProducer: Kees Kasander and Denis Wigman.\nScript: Peter Greenaway.\nCinematography: Sacha Vierny.\nEditing: John Wilson.\nProduction Design: Ben van Os and Jan Roelfs. \nCostume Design: Dien van Straalen.\nMakeup Department: Sjoerd Didden, Sara Meerman and Mary Sturgess. \nSound Department: Garth Marshall and Chris Wyatt.\nOriginal Music: Michael Nyman.\nNon-Original Music: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\n\nThe Cast\n\nJoan Plowright - Cissie Colpitts 1\nJuliet Stevenson - Cissie Colpitts 2\nJoely Richardson - Cissie Colpitts 3\nBernard Hill - Madgett\nJason Edwards - Smut\nBryan Pringle - Jake\nTrevor Cooper - Hardy\nDavid Morrissey - Bellamy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21258ba12fd20114737f41022537e870a3dff6a7","amp;dn":"Drowning+By+Numbers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21258ba12fd20114737f41022537e870a3dff6a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,37,139,161,47,210,1,20,115,127,65,2,37,55,232,112,163,223,246,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
