Our world is beset by global warming, \npollution, resource conflicts, and energy poverty. Millions die from coal plant emissions. \nWe war over mideast oil. Food supplies from sea and land are threatened. Developing nations' \ngrowth exacerbates the crises. Few nations will adopt carbon taxes or energy policies \nagainst their economic self-interests to reduce global CO2 emissions. Energy cheaper \nthan coal will dissuade all nations from burning coal. Innovative thorium energy uses \neconomic persuasion to end the pollution, to provide energy and prosperity to developing \nnations, and to create energy security for all people for all time. &quot;This book presents \na lucid explanation of the workings of thorium-based reactors. It is must reading for \nanyone interested in our energy future.&quot; Leon Cooper, Brown University physicist and \n1972 Nobel laureate for superconductivity &quot;As our energy future is essential I can \nstrongly recommend the book for everybody interested in this most significant topic.&quot; \nGeorge Olah, 1994 Nobel laureate for carbon chemistry\n\nFormat: Single file PDF, multiple screen captures from tablet in portrait view, \n        assembled into a single linear PDF file. 169 MBytes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ac255caaaf609d674d334370d4f5575f20e820e","amp;dn":"Thorium+Energy+Cheaper+than+Coal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ac255caaaf609d674d334370d4f5575f20e820e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,194,85,202,170,246,9,214,116,211,52,55,13,79,85,117,242,14,130,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
