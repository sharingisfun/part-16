This dark fantasy tale is unlike Clive Barker's other recent ones: it is more tightly plotted, and more of this world. In a sequence of well-executed stories within stories (comparable to Russian dolls), Barker unfolds a compelling examination of what it means to be human, to be a man, and to be a gay man--on a planet where aging, disease, and death bring &quot;the passing of things, of days and beasts and men he'd loved.&quot; A satisfying long novel packed with vivid images, memorable characters, and a melancholy mood that reaches for hope. \n\n\n  &quot;Another ambitious and challenging dark fantasy from the popular author and filmmaker who is almost single-handedly elevating supernatural fiction to new levels of both literacy and intensity.&quot;\n\n  &quot;Keith's reading is every author's dream: thoughtful, precise, and beautifully nuanced.&quot;\n\n  &quot;I wanted to create a story and place a character in the middle of it, whose sexual preference had no relevance whatsoever to it. A character readers would take for granted. Will Rabjohns does all of the things that one would expect from a straight hero of sorts. I felt that as long as I have a strong and loyal heterosexual following, I was well positioned to reach out to that audience as well and present them with a page turner. I feel that I have a responsibility\nto tell a story at a pace and with a conviction, so that the reader has no choice but to keep turning the page. The largest percent of my readers are heterosexual, so I hope that they come away somewhat more informed.&quot;  --Clive Barker\n25 July - 6 August 1996\n\n  &quot;To call Clive Barker a 'horror novelist' would be like calling the Beatles a 'garage band'... He is the great imaginer of our time. He knows not only our greatest fears, but also what delights us, what turns us on, and what is truly holy in the world. Haunting, bizarre, beautiful. These are words we can use to describe Clive Barker only until we invent new, more fitting adjectives.&quot; --Quentin Tarantino\n\n  &quot;I think Clive Barker is so good that I am literally tongue-tied. He makes the rest of us look like weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been asleep for the past ten years.&quot; --Stephen King\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ece5b35678c73c9196f16d0defbe92dc95ed718","amp;dn":"SACRAMENT+-+Clive+Barker.+Read+by+by+Ron+Keith+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ece5b35678c73c9196f16d0defbe92dc95ed718","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,206,91,53,103,140,115,201,25,111,22,208,222,251,233,45,201,94,215,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
