Long bootlegged, its original recording engineer Bob Clearmountain has gone back to the multi-track tape reels to remix and remaster it especially for official release on http://stonesarchivestore.com this day of February 1st 2012.\n\nParts of this concert were released in excerpts on the 1982 LP Still Life (American Concert 1981); in particular Ã¢â‚¬â€ the blistering take on Ã¢â‚¬Å“ShatteredÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a fun run-through of early Stones favourite Ã¢â‚¬Å“Time Is on My SideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (their first top-ten hit in the USA, which when re-released in this Ã¢â‚¬â„¢81 incarnation reached number sixty-two on the UK singles chart) and the performance of Ã¢â‚¬Å“LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Spend the Night TogetherÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ where Mick alludes to the Pay-Per-View audience watching at home. That television broadcast infamously showed a fan rushing onto the stage during Ã¢â‚¬Å“SatisfactionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ only to be unceremoniously dispatched by a blow from the backside of Keith RichardsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Telecaster\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n01.&quot;Under My ThumbÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n02.Ã¢â‚¬Å“When the Whip Comes DownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n03.Ã¢â‚¬Å“LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Spend the Night TogetherÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n04.Ã¢â‚¬Å“ShatteredÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n04.Ã¢â‚¬Å“NeighboursÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n05.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Black LimousineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n06.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Just My ImaginationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n07.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Twenty Flight RockÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n08.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Going to a Go-Go \n09.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Let Me GoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n10.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Time Is on My SideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n11.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Beast of BurdenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n12.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Waiting on a FriendÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n13.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Let It BleedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n14.Ã¢â‚¬Å“You CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Always Get What You WantÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n15.Band Introductions \n16.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Little T&amp;AÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n17.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tumbling DiceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n18.Ã¢â‚¬Å“SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s So ColdÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n19.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hang FireÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n20.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Miss YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n21.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Honky Tonk WomenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n22.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Brown SugarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n23.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Start Me UpÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n24.Ã¢â‚¬Å“JumpinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Jack FlashÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n25.Ã¢â‚¬Å“(I CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Get No) SatisfactionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n\nMick Jagger Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals, guitar \nIan Ã¢â‚¬Å“MacÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ MacLagan Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards, vocals \nKeith Richards Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, vocals \nIan Ã¢â‚¬Å“StuÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Stewart Ã¢â‚¬â€œ piano \nCharlie Watts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums \nErnie Watts (Ã¢â‚¬Å“no relationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ saxophone, percussion \nRon Wood Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitars, vocals \nBill Wyman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea5a12d59099ded9f0770ea2b00381b71b39f310","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones+-+Hampton+Coliseum+Live+1981+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea5a12d59099ded9f0770ea2b00381b71b39f310","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,90,18,213,144,153,222,217,240,119,14,162,176,3,129,183,27,57,243,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
