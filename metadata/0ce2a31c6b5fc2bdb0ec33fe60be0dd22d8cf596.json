Hardly a decade since his death has gone by in which establishment critics have not announced the death of his theory. Whole forests have been felled to produce the paper necessary to fuel this effort to marginalize the coauthor of The Communist Manifesto.\n\nAnd yet, despite their best efforts to bury him again and again, MarxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s specter continues to haunt his detractors more than a century after his passing. As another international economic collapse pushes ever growing numbers out of work, and a renewed wave of popular revolt sweeps across the globe, a new generation is learning to ignore all the taboos and scorn piled upon MarxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ideas and rediscovering that the problems he addressed in his time are remarkably similar to those of our own.\n\nIn this engaging and accessible introduction, Alex Callinicos demonstrates that MarxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ideas hold an enduring relevance for todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s activists fighting against poverty, inequality, oppression, environmental destruction, and the numerous other injustices of the capitalist system.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ce2a31c6b5fc2bdb0ec33fe60be0dd22d8cf596","amp;dn":"The+Revolutionary+Ideas+of+Karl+Marx+-+Alex+Callinicos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ce2a31c6b5fc2bdb0ec33fe60be0dd22d8cf596","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,226,163,28,107,95,194,189,176,236,51,254,96,190,13,210,45,140,245,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
