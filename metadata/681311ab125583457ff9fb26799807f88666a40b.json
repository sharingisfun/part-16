Until the day Cyclops recruits them to hunt the new incarnation of the Brotherhood Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and kill them. Joined by a pair of new recruits, Ink and Wolfcub, the young X-Men learn a hard truth about the world post-Messiah CompleX: sometimes old allies make for deadly enemies. \n\nThe series was a reboot of the very popular New X-Men series. This series came with a different writer and art-team and starring just a few of the team-members that where in the New X-men series. Many fans where disappointed by the decision to stop the cult-favorite New X-men and never picked up Young X-men, getting this series cancelled with issue 12, making it the shortest ongoing X-men series in years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:681311ab125583457ff9fb26799807f88666a40b","amp;dn":"Young+X-Men+%28001+-+012%29+%282008+-+2009%29+%28Digital%29+%28AnPymGold-Empir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"681311ab125583457ff9fb26799807f88666a40b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,19,17,171,18,85,131,69,127,249,251,38,121,152,7,248,134,102,164,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
