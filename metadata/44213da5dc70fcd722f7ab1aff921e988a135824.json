Mark Vanhoenacker, a 747 pilot who left academia and a career in the business world to pursue his childhood dream of flight, asks us to reimagine what weâ€”both as pilots and as passengersâ€”are actually doing when we enter the world between departure and discovery. In a seamless fusion of history, politics, geography, meteorology, ecology, family, and physics, Vanhoenacker vaults across geographical and cultural boundaries; above mountains, oceans, and deserts; through snow, wind, and rain, renewing a simultaneously humbling and almost superhuman activity that affords us unparalleled perspectives on the planet we inhabit and the communities we form","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44213da5dc70fcd722f7ab1aff921e988a135824","amp;dn":"Skyfaring_+A+Journey+With+a+Pilot+-+Mark+Vanhoenacker.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44213da5dc70fcd722f7ab1aff921e988a135824","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,33,61,165,220,112,252,215,34,247,171,26,255,146,30,152,138,19,88,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
