Existing users of MouseCam Pup for whom voice is also an option, will benefit from its features and should be able to mix the two methods of control to great effect as it eliminates the need for typing. If you have used neither before, I would recommend becoming familiar with each method separately before attempting to combine the two. \n\n The features of MouseCam Pup are well documented in its own thread so I will not repeat them here. Minor changes from the point of view of a pure Eviacam user are: \n 1. Text to speech (TTS) now included by default. \n 2. Navigation icons removed from across top of screen. \n\nThe main voice control features include: \n\n 1. The ability to search for and play anything on YouTube. \n 2. Send and receive voice mail using the Vocaroo service. \n 3. Use the new Google voice search with some spoken replies when Google provides them. \n 4. To open any website. \n 5. To open and navigate any hyperlinks on the BBC News site. (The ability to navigate webpage hyperlinks by voice is site dependant. It works on some but not others.) \n 6. Desktop and webpage navigation. \n 7. Integration with Ã¢â‚¬Å“single switchÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ solutions. \n 8. Experimental XBMC navigation.\n\nmore [url]http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?search_id=568270644&amp;t=88095[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a0932bc43d44b6cfacb16a5cc7901756f61c216","amp;dn":"Obedient_Pup_v3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a0932bc43d44b6cfacb16a5cc7901756f61c216","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,9,50,188,67,212,75,108,250,203,22,165,204,121,1,117,111,97,194,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
