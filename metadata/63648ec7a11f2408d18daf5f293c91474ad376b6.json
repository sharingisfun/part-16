ELO were formed to accommodate Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne's desire to create modern rock and pop songs with classical overtones. After Wood's departure following the band's debut record, Lynne wrote and arranged all of the group's original compositions and produced every album.\nDespite early singles success in the UK the band were initially more successful in the United States, billed as &quot;The English guys with the big fiddles&quot;. They soon gained a cult following despite lukewarm reviews back in their native United Kingdom. By the mid-1970s, they had become one of the biggest selling bands in music. From 1972 to 1986, ELO accumulated 27 Top 40 hit singles in both the UK and the US. The group also scored 20 Top 20 U.K. hit singles, as well as 19 Top 20 hit singles in the U.S. Billboard charts. The band also holds the record for having the most Billboard Hot 100 Top 40 hits of any band in US chart history without ever having a number one single.\nELO collected 21 RIAA awards, 38 BPI awards, and sold well over 50 million records worldwide, not including singles. \n\nPlease SEED for to Enjoy!\nCheers, Bubanee \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nElectric Light Orchestra - All Over The World - The Very Best Of Electric Light Orchestra\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Electric Light Orchestra\nAlbum................: All Over The World - The Very Best Of Electric Light Orchestra\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2005\nRipper...............: dBpoweramp (Secure mode) &amp; \nCodec................: LAME 3.98\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Standard, (avg. bitrate: 201kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: ID3 v2.3\nInformation..........: Includes the cover in the Tracks\n\nRipped by............: Bubanee\nPosted by............: on 1/22/2011\nNews Server..........:\nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: NFO - Cov\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
