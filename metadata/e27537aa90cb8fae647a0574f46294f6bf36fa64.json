Almost uniquely, his works have never suffered the slightest period of eclipse. Profoundly emotional yet governed by an iron discipline, the music, like the man, is a fascinating, entertaining, often deeply moving blend of opposites. He had a gift for friendship and a capacity for love far beyond the ordinary, yet no man could be ruder or more hurtful. Though humble, he was consumed by a sense of destiny, and his inner life, colored by his adoration and fear of women, found expression in some of the greatest music ever written. Listening to this audio-biography is leaping inside the life and times of a great German Romantic, understanding the man who was haunted by the ghost of Beethoven for years and was forty-three before he wrote his First Symphony.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e27537aa90cb8fae647a0574f46294f6bf36fa64","amp;dn":"The+Life+and+Works+of+Brahms+-+Jeremy+Siepmann","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e27537aa90cb8fae647a0574f46294f6bf36fa64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,117,55,170,144,203,143,174,100,122,5,116,244,98,148,246,191,54,250,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
