Best selling author and lecture, Dr. Nick Begich\nwill present the most startling advances in this area of technology for\nboth military and private sector uses. The presentation will provide in\ndepth information, demonstrations, background and forecasts of development\nof these areas of science as they affect our society and individual freedom.\nEnhancing human performance or controlling human outcomes will be the\nchallenge of the century raising serious questions on the ethics of the\nscience of mind control. Control of the human mind by external means is\nnow a reality ? how we use this technology is the next challenge for this\ngeneration.\n\nSome very promising new technology I enjoyed this for some of the positive\nnews, Vol 2 is better though ;) More dirt on HAARP and police state tracking.\nShould be released in next couple days. Enjoy.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f7750dd0b805f3cc35c248d829b489666292e35","amp;dn":"Mind+Control+-++Dr.+Nick+Begich+-+Earth+Rising+Vol.1+-+DVD-Rip+%26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f7750dd0b805f3cc35c248d829b489666292e35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,119,80,221,11,128,95,60,195,92,36,141,130,155,72,150,102,41,46,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
