Walking down the street unknowingly, he suddenly realizes that he is not only subject to the gruesome moods of several spectators but also at the mercy of the filmmaker. He defends himself heroically, but is condemned to the gallows, where he dies a filmic death through a tearing of the film itself.\nOur hero then descends into Hades, the realm of shades. Here, in the underground of cinematography, he encounters innumerable printing instructions, the means whereby the existence of every filmic image is made possible. In other words, our hero encounters the conditions of his own possibility, the conditions of his very existence as a filmic shade.\nInstructions for a Light and Sound Machine is an attempt to transform a Roman Western into a Greek tragedy.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Instructions for a Light and Sound Machine.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 358,192,666 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 16:20.280\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD 1.1.0 Final\nFrame Size ......................................: 720x320 (AR: 2.250)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 2753 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.478 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 160 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493428/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493428/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNo language, no subtitles.
