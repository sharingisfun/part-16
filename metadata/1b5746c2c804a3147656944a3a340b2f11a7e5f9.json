Readers will gain understanding of how to formulate Spectral Finite Element; learn about wave behaviour in inhomogeneous and anisotropic media; and, be able to design some diagnostic tools for monitoring the health of a structure. Tables, figures and graphs support the theory and case studies are included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b5746c2c804a3147656944a3a340b2f11a7e5f9","amp;dn":"Spectral+Finite+Element+Method","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b5746c2c804a3147656944a3a340b2f11a7e5f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,87,70,194,200,4,163,20,118,86,148,74,58,52,11,47,17,167,229,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
