It has been, quite literally, behind some of the greatest names in modern music. \n\nIt all started in 1962 when drum shop owner Jim Marshall discovered the distinctive growl that gave the electric guitar an exciting new voice. Music got a whole lot louder as young musicians like Clapton, Townshend and Hendrix adopted the revolutionary 'Marshall Sound'. The electric guitar now spoke for a new generation and the genre of rock was born.\n\nSoon Marshall stacks and walls were an essential backdrop of rock 'n' roll. The excesses of rock machismo were gloriously lampooned in the 1984 movie This is Spinal Tap. In an extrodinary piece of reverse irony, it was this comic exposure that rescued the company from financial meltdown.\n\nWith contributions from rock legends like Pete Townshend, Lemmy and Slash, plus an interview with the 'Father of Loud' Jim Marshall, this documentary cruises down the rock ages with all the dials set to 'eleven'.\n \n \n \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04c3l7j&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04c3l7j&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n ============= What's In This Torrent =============\n\n \n\n\nPlay It Loud - The Story Of Marshall - (1x60 Minutes) \n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : Play It Loud - The Story Of Marshall.avi\nFormat                      : AVI\nFormat info                 : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                   : 700 MB\nDuration (ms)               : 58mn 48s\nOverallBitRate_Mode/String  : Variable\nTotal bitrate               : 1 664 Kbps\nEncoded application         : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nEncoded library             : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n===================== Video =====================\nId                          : 0\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile              : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings - BVOP      : 1\nFormat settings - QPel      : No\nFormat settings - GMC       : No warppoints\nFormat settings - Matrix    : Custom\nCodec Id                    : XVID\nCodec                       : XviD\nDuration (ms)               : 58mn 48s\nBitrate                     : 1 546 Kbps\nWidth                       : 720 pixels\nHeight                      : 416 pixels\nAspect ratio                : 1.731\nFramerate                   : 25.000 fps\nColorimetry                 : YUV\nColos space                 : 4:2:0\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\nScan type                   : Progressive\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.206\nStream size                 : 650 MB (93%)\nEncoded library             : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nId                          : 1\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 3\nFormat settings mode        : Joint stereo\nFormat settings mode extens : MS Stereo\nCodec Id                    : 55\nCodec                       : MP3\nDuration (ms)               : 58mn 48s\nBitrate mode                : Variable\nBitrate                     : 105 Kbps\nBitRate_Nominal/String      : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 44.3 MB (6%)\nAlignement                  : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave duration         : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave preload          : 498 ms\nEncoded library             : LAME3.98r\nEncoded library settings    : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 --abr 128","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc3b43449a590951f804354717ac33141f2c0d79","amp;dn":"Play+It+Loud+-+The+Story+Of+Marshall+%28Amps%29+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc3b43449a590951f804354717ac33141f2c0d79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,59,67,68,154,89,9,81,248,4,53,71,23,172,51,20,31,44,13,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
