The parent has become unavailable, the teen responds in kind, and a negative, often destructive cycle of communication begins. Well, the truth of the matter is, you can physically be right next to someone and still not really be available to them. If you need them to be something theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not, if you are harsh, criticizing and judging, if your anxiety is center stage, then you are not truly available.\n\nenjoy,seed,comment","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c770db38612772869d37e3703966d34cf3207ef1","amp;dn":"The+Available+Parent.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c770db38612772869d37e3703966d34cf3207ef1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,112,219,56,97,39,114,134,157,55,227,112,57,102,211,76,243,32,126,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
