They recorded an astonishing number of albums (about half a dozen) and singles in the mid-'60s; the &quot;Wipe Out&quot; follow-up, &quot;Point Panic,&quot; was the only one to struggle up to the middle of the charts. The Surfaris were not extraordinary, but they were more talented than the typical one-shot surf group; drummer Ron Wilson was praised by session stickman extraordinaire Hal Blaine, and his uninhibited splashing style sounds like a direct ancestor to Keith Moon. He also took the lead vocals on the group's occasional Beach Boys imitations.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-surfaris-p20862/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-surfaris-p20862/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/surfers-rule-r50606&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/surfers-rule-r50606&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
