Two seasons were produced from 1973 to 1975. The 14 films were contracted to be exhibited in 500 theaters in 400 cities, admission based on subscription to the entire series.\r\n\r\nThe films were released on DVD in 2003 by Kino International and again in 2008 as a boxed set. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy notes:\r\n\r\n   I saw these when they were shown in the theater when they were released. Reading the extraordinary list of plays and casts well-known to movie goers as well as the professional theater will leave you wanting more.  It took 30 years to have these films come to vhs and then DVD.  When home video was new, the AFT was one of the first things I thought of that should be available.  Why it took so long I don't know.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Man in the Glass Booth is an extraordinary work for theater.  Schell was nominated for an Oscar for his performance when it came out.  But this is not a Hollywood film.  And because of its power it is best just to view the film without too much background on it.  Why?  Because there are elements of mystery threaded through the story-- mystery which adds to the enjoyment of the piece.  And for that reason I leave off further comment.\r\n\r\n   \r\n   Notes written July 1, 2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f41def677f66c8c1b793e4f6d192521bafa1d39c","amp;dn":"The+Man+in+the+Glass+Booth+%281975%29+w.+Maximillian+Schell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f41def677f66c8c1b793e4f6d192521bafa1d39c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,29,239,103,127,102,200,193,183,147,228,246,209,146,82,27,175,161,211,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
