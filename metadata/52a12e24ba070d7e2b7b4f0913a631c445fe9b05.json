At 30, she lives in Camden: cheeky, playful, frank while funny, and talkative to strangers. She's a conscientious and exuberant primary-school teacher, flatmates with Zoe, her long-time friend; she's close to one sister, and not so close to another. In this slice of life story, we watch her take driving lessons from Scott, a dour and tightly-wound instructor, take classes in flamenco dance from a fiery Spaniard, encounter a tramp in the night, and sort out a student's aggressive behavior with a social worker's help. Along the way, we wonder if her open attitude puts her at risk of misunderstanding or worse. What is the root of happiness?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52a12e24ba070d7e2b7b4f0913a631c445fe9b05","amp;dn":"Happy+Go+Lucky+2008+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52a12e24ba070d7e2b7b4f0913a631c445fe9b05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,161,46,36,186,7,13,126,43,123,79,9,19,166,49,196,69,254,155,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
