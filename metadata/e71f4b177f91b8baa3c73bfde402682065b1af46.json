The Jacksonville band released two albums, but disbanded in 1982 due to increasing instability with guitarist Allen Collins following the death of his wife in 1980. Another contributing factor was the growing relationship between vocalist Dale Krantz and Gary Rossington, who married soon after the band dissolved.\n\nAnytime, Anyplace, Anywhere (1980) \n\nIncluded the hit &quot;Don't Misunderstand Me&quot;, along with the lesser hit &quot;One Good Man&quot; \nMost of the songs on this album were composed by Allen Collins, who was one of the first people to form the band. \nThe song &quot;Opportunity&quot; features Barry Harwood on all guitars (using Allen Collins' Gibson Explorer) with the exception of Gary Rossington's solos. \nBarry Harwood performed many solos on the album, including all lead guitar on &quot;Prime Time,&quot; the final solo on &quot;Don't Misunderstand Me,&quot; all solos on &quot;Three Times as Bad,&quot; the clean double-tracked solo on &quot;Getaway,&quot; the slide guitar on &quot;Winners and Losers,&quot; and the final solo on &quot;Sometimes You Can Put it Out.&quot; \nGary Rossington played lead/solo guitar on &quot;Don't Misunderstand Me,&quot; &quot;One Good Man,&quot; &quot;Opportunity,&quot; &quot;Getaway,&quot; &quot;Misery Loves Company,&quot; and the slide guitar on &quot;Sometimes You Can Put it Out.&quot; \nAllen Collins remained mostly in the background on this album, playing rhythms primarily. However, he did play the final solo on &quot;One Good Man,&quot; &quot;Getaway,&quot; and &quot;Misery Loves Company.&quot; \nOn &quot;Don't Misunderstand Me,&quot; the entire band (with the exception of Leon Wilkeson) tuned to Dropped-D. \nSingles: \nDon't Misunderstand Me (A-Side)/Winners and Losers (B-Side) \nGetaway (A-Side)/Sometimes You Can Put It Out (B-Side) \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e71f4b177f91b8baa3c73bfde402682065b1af46","amp;dn":"The+Rossington+Collins+Band+-+%5C%27Anytime+Anyplace+Anywhere%5C%27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e71f4b177f91b8baa3c73bfde402682065b1af46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,31,75,23,127,145,184,186,163,199,59,253,228,2,104,32,101,177,175,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
