All are searchable pdf files with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\n\nThese are short books written by a multi-faceted intellectual who is not a biblical scholar but is a fine writer. Wills is known for being simultaneously an extremely harsh critic of the Vatican as well as a sometimes surprisingly traditional Catholic.\n\nHere's a description of the first book (and the other two are similar in scope):\n\nIn what are billed &quot;culture wars,&quot; people on the political right and the political left cite Jesus as endorsing their views. Garry Wills argues that Jesus subscribed to no political program. He was far more radical than that. In a fresh reading of the gospels, Wills explores the meaning of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“reign of heavenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Jesus not only promised for the future but brought with him into this life. It is only by dodges and evasions that people misrepresent what Jesus plainly had to say against power, the wealthy, and religion itself. But Wills is just as critical of those who would make Jesus a mere ethical teacher, ignoring or playing down his divinity. An illuminating analysis for believers and nonbelievers alike, What Jesus Meant is a brilliant addition to our national conversation on religion.\n\n\nabout the author:\n\nGarry Wills (born May 22, 1934) is a prolific Pulitzer Prize-winning American author, journalist, and historian, specializing in American history, politics, and religion, especially the history of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nWills has written nearly 40 books and since 1973 and has been a frequent reviewer for the New York Review of Books. He became a faculty member of the history department at Northwestern University in 1980, where he is currently an Emeritus Professor of History.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5bd0287d0df129e915783da69859e0b1583c4ef","amp;dn":"Garry+Wills+-+What+Jesus%2C+the+Gospels%2C+Paul+Meant+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5bd0287d0df129e915783da69859e0b1583c4ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,189,2,135,208,223,18,158,145,87,131,218,105,133,158,11,21,131,196,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
