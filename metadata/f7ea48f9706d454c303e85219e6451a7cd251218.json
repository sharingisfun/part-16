She's the best Greek female singer , her vocal technique is awsome and the timbre of her voice is just ethereal. No wonder why the ECM releases &quot;Sumiglia&quot; and &quot;Songs Of An Other&quot; received such fervent critics worldwide. Luckily the pressing contained an English booklet which I scanned.\n A TRUE SINGING GODDESS.\n\nENJOY!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7ea48f9706d454c303e85219e6451a7cd251218","amp;dn":"Savina+Yannatou+with+Primavera+en+Salonico+-+Songs+Of+The+Medite","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7ea48f9706d454c303e85219e6451a7cd251218","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,234,72,249,112,109,69,76,48,62,133,33,158,100,81,167,205,37,18,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
