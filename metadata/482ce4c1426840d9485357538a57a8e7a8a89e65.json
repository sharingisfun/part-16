An amazing hour-long live creation\n(improvisation)...images of valleys, other universes, whatever comes to\nmind...an exercise in true &quot;deep listening&quot;as she refers to the concerts her\nfoundation presents in upstate New York.\n\n\nBy KURT GOTTSCHALK &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=22230&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=22230&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWhile Pauline Oliveros' output has its high and low marks, the composer,\naccordionist and organizer is an undeniable force in new music. For fifty years\nshe has pursued sonic experiments, and as the founder of the Deep Listening\nInstitute, she has supported many other sound innovators.\n\nSadly, it's sometimes easier to respect her from afar than to closely follow her\nwork. Her choices in collaborators can get in the way, and they often seem to be\nmade out social or political sympathies as much as musical ones. But there are\ngems within her catalogue, such as Troglodyte's Delight (1990) with her Deep\nListening Band or the early tape experiments on Alien Bog and Beautiful Soop\n(1997). Her 1998 release The Roots of the Moment, just reissued by Hatology, is\namong those essentials.\n\nEssentially a solo recording, Oliveros and her accordion are found here within\nan &quot;electronic environment created by Peter Ward. The electronic element isn't\nexplained in the liner notes (written by her neighbor, saxophonist Joe McPhee,\nwith whom she's collaborated), and its presence seems subtle on the\nrecording. Reverb and delay may be present at times, but it might be best just\nto assume they're there.\n\nEither way, Oliveros creates a fascinating, elongated suite (six tracks clocking\nin at just under an hour) with her instrument. Her &quot;just intonation accordion\nallows worlds of small intervals, allowing odd intervals and tonal\njuxtapositions that are complex without dissonance. The pace varies from very\nslow to quiet trots, but the overall effect is of being submerged into the\naccordion. They may polka when they're awake, but this is the sleeping\nsqueezebox's sound.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:482ce4c1426840d9485357538a57a8e7a8a89e65","amp;dn":"Pauline+Oliveros+-+The+Roots+Of+The+Moment+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"482ce4c1426840d9485357538a57a8e7a8a89e65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,44,228,193,66,104,64,217,72,83,87,83,138,87,168,231,168,168,158,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
