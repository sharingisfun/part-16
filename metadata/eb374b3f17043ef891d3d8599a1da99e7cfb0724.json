Each operated semi-independently and faced unique within the vast territory of the Russian interior. Primarily based on German combat footage, each episode is a broad portrait of the objectives, campaigns, and eventual fates of these separate commands during the largest and most destructive land campaign ever launched. \n\nCover:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/GAOpmaABf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/GAOpmaABf&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nArmy Group South\n----------------\n\nThe objective of Army Group South was to capture the oil fields surrounding the Caucasus Mountains. This oil was critical to the future of the Nazi war effort. Their indecision about whether the primary goal of the campaign should be Moscow or these oil fields effectively hamstrung the German Campaign and led to the eventual Soviet victory. Also covered is the disastrous battle of Stalingrad, perhaps the most vicious of any battle during the war.\n\n\nBroadcast Channel: Discovery Networks UK\nProduced by:  Cromwell Productions - (c) 1999\n\n\n=== File Information ===\nFile Name: Scorched Earth - the Wehrmacht in Russia - Army Group South (1999) [DVDRip (XviD)].avi\nDuration: 00:48:50 (73,244 fr)\nFile Size: 398 MB (or 407,940 KB or 417,730,830 bytes)\n\n\n=== Video Information ===\nVideo Codec Name: XviD\nVideo Bitrate:        1004 kb/s\nBits / Pixel:         0.131 bits/pixel\nResolution:           640x480 (1.33:1) [=4:3]\nframes Per Second:   25.000\n\n\n=== Audio Information ===\nAudio Codec:         0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate:       128 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) CBR \nFrequency:             48000 Hz\n\n\n\nArmy Group Center\n-----------------\n\nThis episode follows the travails of Army Group Center, the group tasked with the capture of Moscow.
