Some levels contain obstacles such as deadly boulders, animals who delay or kill Pac-Man, and explosive projectiles. After every few rounds there is a bonus mini-game in which the player can obtain some extra points (with every 50,000 points earning Pac-Man an extra life). The levels also feature a variety of shapes and architectural features such as cylindrical mazes, canopies, bridges, pyramids, and even walls that allow Pac-Man to walk vertically. The game features more sophisticated events than its arcade predecessor, such as collecting a certain number of pellets to unlock another area of a maze. The game also includes the ability to see the short intermission videos that come before a new level and allow for an option of non-storyline play on specific levels. The game also has the ability to connect over the Internet for multiplayer mini-games.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease rate and write comment if worked for you or not. :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca335668718053b228bef69f3bc9d45cc342753c","amp;dn":"Pac-Man+Adventures+in+Time+%28ISO%29+PC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca335668718053b228bef69f3bc9d45cc342753c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,51,86,104,113,128,83,178,40,190,246,159,59,201,212,92,195,66,117,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
