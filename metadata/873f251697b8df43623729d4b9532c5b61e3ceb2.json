A tall, skinny misfit of a wizard named Prospero lives in the Southern Kingdom a patchwork of feuding duchies and small manors, all loosely loyal to one figurehead king. Both he and an improbable adventurer named Roger Bacon look in mirrors to see different times and places, which greatly affects their personalities and mannerisms and leads them into a myriad of situations that are sometimes frightening and often hilarious. Hailed by critics as an extraordinary work, combining the thrills of a horror novel with the inventiveness of fantasy, The Face in the Frost is the debut novel that launched John Bellairs' reputation as one of the most individual voices in fantasy fiction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:873f251697b8df43623729d4b9532c5b61e3ceb2","amp;dn":"John+Bellairs+-+The+Face+in+the+Frost","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"873f251697b8df43623729d4b9532c5b61e3ceb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,63,37,22,151,184,223,67,98,55,41,212,185,83,44,91,97,227,206,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
