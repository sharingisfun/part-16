Apperently there was een crc-error in the rar-files.\nSorry, sorry, sorry....\n\nNo more rar-files this time. Now it is an .iso file which I double-checked. It works!\n\n\nI've always loved this film when I was young. Unfortunately, there is no Dutch version of this DVD. Moreover, there is not even an English version of this movie. However I searched on the internet, the only version I could find was the original Swedish version. I had to do something! On the net I found subtitles in english, written by Anja Nyberg. Apperently she made custom subtitles translating her native Swedish into English. Thank you very very much Anja! I used Anja's English subtitles and translated them into Dutch. I watched the movie with the subtitles and adapted the subtitles again and again until I was satisfied.\n\nI edited Anja's subtitles a little bit. I changed the Swedish Names into the correct English names using a PDF-file I found on the net.\n(http://epubl.ltu.se/1402-1773/1999/27/LTU-CUPP-9927-SE.pdf -- It is an\nan analysis of the translation of Ronja RÃƒÂ¶vardotter into English by Marie Nordlund -- Many thanks to you too)\n\nI couldn't find such a nice piece of work like that for the Dutch language. So, I only changed the names of Skalle-Per and Lill-Klippen into 'Kale Per' and 'Kleine Klip' respectivly, as these are the only names that really mean something. The other characters, apart from the main characters, do not play a major part in the movie, so I didn't translate their names.\n\nI downloaded the DVD using bittorrent and demuxed the DVD using DVD Decrypter. I threw away the extras and the Swedish subs. I made a custom menu and put everything back together with the new English and Dutch subs, using DVDLab Pro. As the main movie was smaller than 4,5 GB, I didn't had to re-encode it to make it fit on a DVD-5.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7cfe8af2f09aa030c689ded3480a30b5ed9516c","amp;dn":"Ronja+Rovardotter+-+English+%26+Dutch+Subs+-+PAL+-+DVDr+-+Working","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7cfe8af2f09aa030c689ded3480a30b5ed9516c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,207,232,175,47,9,170,3,12,104,157,237,52,128,163,11,94,217,81,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
