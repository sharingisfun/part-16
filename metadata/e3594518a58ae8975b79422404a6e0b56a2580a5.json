From all outward appearances, Quoyle has gone through his first 36 years on earth as a big schlump of a loser. He&amp;#039;s not attractive, he&amp;#039;s not brilliant or witty or talented, and he&amp;#039;s not the kind of person who typically assumes the central position in a novel. But Proulx creates a simple and compelling tale of Quoyle&amp;#039;s psychological and spiritual growth. Along the way, we get to look in on the maritime beauty of what is probably a disappearing way of life.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3594518a58ae8975b79422404a6e0b56a2580a5","amp;dn":"%5BAudiobook%5D+Annie+Proulx%2C+The+Shipping+News+Disc+1-11","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3594518a58ae8975b79422404a6e0b56a2580a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,89,69,24,165,138,232,151,91,121,66,36,4,166,224,181,106,37,128,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
