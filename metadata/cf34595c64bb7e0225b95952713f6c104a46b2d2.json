The way he opens Fishscale with the frantic, hyperactive &quot;Shakey Dog,&quot; is all the evidence you&amp;#039;d need to see how Ghost is that rare MC who&amp;#039;s gotten better with age. His jumble of colorful wordplay is now honed into a sharp edge of drug-game narratives (&quot;R.A.G.U.&quot;), neighborhood stories (&quot;Barbershop&quot;), honeyed pimp talk (&quot;Big Girl&quot;) and braggadocio raw enough to melt minds (&quot;Be Easy&quot;). Backing him up are both familiar partners-in-rhyme like Raekwon (who sounds his best in years), Cappadonna, and Trife and also a surprising squad of underground producers that includes Just Blaze, Pete Rock, MF Doom, and the late J-Dilla. One of the skit quips that Ghost hasn&amp;#039;t been this focused since Supreme Clientele, his 2000 classic; that&amp;#039;s no joke--this is his best since then. --Oliver Wang\n\n1.
