There are several torrents out there claiming to be it, but they really just take the tracks from music bank, and tag it as the EP.\n\nAs always, my discogs have 100% complete/accurate ID3 500x500 album art.\n\nStudio Albums\n1. Dirt\n2. Facelift\n3. Self-Titled\n4. Black Gives Way to Blue\n\nEPs\n5. Sap\n6. Jar Of Flies\n\nLive Albums\n7. Unplugged\n8. Live\n\nCompilation\n9. Nothing Safe: Best Of The Box*\n\nA Single\n10 Again**\n\nBox Set\n11 Music Bank\n\n*Note 1: I actually only included the 1 exclusive track on this release, the rest \n         appear in the box set, and I don't need to fill my drive with duplicate \n         content.\n\n**Note 2: The Club/Jungle remixes are the same. The Jungle &amp; Trip Hop mix do not \n          have very good sound quality, it was the best I could find, but in my \n          opinion, they aren't very god anyway.\n\nAs always, please help me seed, and ENJOY.\n\nHMD3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa7039fba83ce4239f61ee88826e7f1b2d487341","amp;dn":"Alice+In+Chains+-+Discog+%5B320kbps%5D%5BHMD3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa7039fba83ce4239f61ee88826e7f1b2d487341","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,112,57,251,168,60,228,35,159,97,238,136,130,110,127,27,45,72,115,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
