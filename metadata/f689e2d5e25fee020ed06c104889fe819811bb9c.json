I apologize for my previous upload, WMP corrupted the tags, and I have fixed that problem.  Anyone who started it should be able to finish with this upload.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of this excellent CD features one of Billie Holiday's finest concert recordings of the 1950s. Recorded in Europe before an admiring audience, this enjoyable set finds Lady Day performing seven of her standards with her trio and joining in for jam session versions of &quot;Billie's Blues&quot; and &quot;Lover Come Back to Me&quot; with an all-star group starring clarinetist Buddy DeFranco, vibraphonist Red Norvo and guitarist Jimmy Raney. These performances (which find Holiday in stronger voice than on her studio recordings of the period) have also been included in Verve's massive CD box set. This program concludes with Holiday's four rare sides for Aladdin in 1951 (between her Decca and Verve periods) which are highlighted by two blues and &quot;Detour Ahead,&quot; and her 1942 studio recording of &quot;Trav'lin' Light&quot; with Paul Whiteman's Orchestra. ~ Scott Yanow, All Music Guide\nTrack Listing\n# Track#\n# Title\n# time\n#\n# lyrics\n# 1\n# Announcement by Leonard Feather\n# 0:27\n#\n#\n# 2\n# Blue Moon (Live)\n# 2:15\n#\n\n#\n# 3\n# All of Me (Live)\n# 1:43\n#\n\n#\n# 4\n# My Man (Live)\n# 2:51\n#\n\n#\n# 5\n# Them Their Eyes (Live)\n# 1:40\n#\n\n#\n# 6\n# I Cried for You (Live)\n# 3:22\n#\n\n#\n# 7\n# What a Little Moonlight Can Do (Live)\n# 2:45\n#\n\n#\n# 8\n# I Cover the Waterfront (Live)\n# 3:10\n#\n\n#\n# 9\n# Billie's Blues (Live)\n# 0:20\n#\n#\n# 10\n# Lover, Come Back to Me (Live)\n# 11:35\n#\n\n#\n# 11\n# Blue Turning Grey Over You\n# 6:39\n#\n\n#\n# 12\n# Be Fair With Me Baby\n# 2:01\n#\n\n#\n# 13\n# Rocky Mountain Blues\n# 2:36\n#\n\n#\n# 14\n# Detour Ahead\n# 3:04\n#\n\n#\n# 15\n# Trav'lin' Light\n# 3:03\n#\n\n#\n# 16\n# I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You\n# 3:17\n#\n\n#\nCredits\n\n    * Murray McEachern\n    * Trombone\n\n    * Ron McMaster\n    * Digital Transfers\n\n    * Artie Shapiro\n    * Bass\n\n    * Bobby Tucker\n    * Piano\n\n    * Carl Drinkard\n    * Piano\n\n    * Larry Neill\n    * Trumpet\n\n    * Mike Pingatore\n    * Guitar\n\n    * Monty Kelly\n    * Trumpet\n\n    * Skip Layton\n    * Trombone\n\n    * Lennie Hartman\n    * Reeds\n\n    * Don Waddilove\n    * Trumpet\n\n    * Willie Rodriguez\n    * Drums\n\n    * Buddy Weed\n    * Piano\n\n    * Alvy West\n    * Reeds\n\n    * Billie Holiday\n    * Vocals, Main Performer\n\n    * Michael Cuscuna\n    * Release Production\n\n    * Mark Gardner\n    * Liner Notes\n\n    * Haywood Henry\n    * Sax (Baritone), Sax (Tenor)\n\n    * Elaine Leighton\n    * Drums\n\n    * Beryl Booker\n    * Piano, Soloist\n\n    * Sonny Clark\n    * Piano, Soloist\n\n    * Buddy DeFranco\n    * Clarinet\n\n    * Leonard Feather\n    * Liner Notes\n\n    * Tiny Grimes\n    * Guitar\n\n    * Red Mitchell\n    * Bass\n\n    * Red Norvo\n    * Vibraphone\n\n    * Jimmy Raney\n    * Guitar\n\n    * Paul Whiteman\n    * Musical Director\n\n    * Jimmy Mundy\n    * Arranger\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f689e2d5e25fee020ed06c104889fe819811bb9c","amp;dn":"Billie+Holiday%3A++Billie%5C%27s+Blues--re-upload--vikingsfreak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f689e2d5e25fee020ed06c104889fe819811bb9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,137,226,213,226,95,238,2,14,208,108,16,72,137,254,129,152,17,187,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
