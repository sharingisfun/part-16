The 21-minute, multi-part, string-band symphony Ã¢â‚¬Å“All ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dead May Live Again/Face with a HoleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ may become Railroad EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s identifying recording Ã¢â‚¬â€ the moment where they laugh in the faces of the critics whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve lazily dubbed them the Ã¢â‚¬Å“folk-pop- Celtic-bluegrass-roots-and-rock act from Jersey.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The piece finds this sextet beautifully, seamlessly weaving through distinct movements and melodies that cover the gamut of styles and emotions Ã¢â‚¬â€ like The DecemberistsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ The Hazards of Love, but more focused. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re bravely staring down a storm in the whipping third movement before a blissful, meditative, piano-led calm takes over in the fourth, and an uplifting chant marches through the fifth and sixth.\n\nIs it impossible to pin down? ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the point. Recorded in a private home studio in rural New Jersey, Railroad EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first new album in three years plays into the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strengths: long songs, rich harmonies, layer upon layer of acoustic picking and elastic electric, Tim CarboneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s truly gnarly fiddle and big, bright choruses. The album opens on a classic Railroad Earth note: the big-smile, anything-is-possible sing-along Ã¢â‚¬Å“ChasinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ A Rainbow.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ But the energy quickly dips on the slow-creeping title trackÃ¢â‚¬â€which couldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been shuffled to the back, or forgotten altogether. Thankfully, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Grandfather MountainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ brings us back with a gorgeous, swirling ode to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“oldest eyes upon the planet, watching ages come and go.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a perfect segue into that 21-minute juggernaut, and the band emerges on the other side with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Monkey,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which hits like a string-band cover of the best song that Jackson Browne never wrote. The soaring Ã¢â‚¬Å“When the Sun Gets in Your BloodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is all road-tripping, open-sky glory. As Todd Sheaffer crows, Ã¢â‚¬Å“When the sun gets in your bloodÃ¢â‚¬Â¦People everywhere will seek out all your love,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ his light is infectious. With straightforward shuffles like Ã¢â‚¬Å“One More Night on the RoadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hangtown BallÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ bookending the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more experimental material, Railroad Earth ensure that both classicists and letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s-get-weird listeners can find something to dig into.\n\nBut itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the more ambitious material that really impresses: When electric guitar cracks the sky in the sixth movement, or when they shift from stomping rock to the pieceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s whispered finale, Railroad Earth is so much more than Ã¢â‚¬Å“folk-pop-Celtic-bluegrass-roots-and-rockÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€if that ever seemed possible.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e22ab844ad6351759c92307acc8324c68bf2cf2","amp;dn":"Railroad+Earth+-+The+Last+of+the+Outlaws+%282014%29+FLAC+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e22ab844ad6351759c92307acc8324c68bf2cf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,34,171,132,74,214,53,23,89,201,35,7,172,200,50,76,104,191,44,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
