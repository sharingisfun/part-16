It provides almost unlimited ways of editing and processing videos. AviSynth works as a frameserver, providing instant editing without the need for temporary files. \n\nAviSynth itself does not provide a graphical user interface (GUI) but instead relies on a script system that allows advanced non-linear editing. While this may at first seem tedious and unintuitive, it is remarkably powerful and is a very good way to manage projects in a precise, consistent, and reproducible manner. Because text-based scripts are human readable, projects are inherently self-documenting. The scripting language is simple yet powerful, and complex filters can be created from basic operations to develop a sophisticated palette of useful and unique effects. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6124311419496deff3fc9b838f83363ee537374f","amp;dn":"AVISynth+257+with+AVSSmoothDeinterlacer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6124311419496deff3fc9b838f83363ee537374f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,36,49,20,25,73,109,239,243,252,155,131,143,131,54,62,229,55,55,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
