MacNamara presides over the Coca-Cola branch of Germany. He is working hard and trying his very \nbest to impress the Atlanta headquarters, since he has heard that the European headquarters in London will soon be looking for a new head. Now, Coca-Cola boss Mr. Hazeltine asks MacNamara to take care of his daughter Scarlett, who is going to take a trip to Europe. \n\nScarlett, however, does not behave the way a young respectable girl of her age should: Instead of sightseeing, she goes out until the early morning and has lots of fun. Finally, she falls in love with Otto Piffl, a young man from East Berlin and a flaming Communist, and marries him surprisingly. When MacNamara hears of this, he intrigues quite a bit with the help of his assistant Schlemmer to get Piffl into an East German prison, but when he also gets note of his Boss and wife coming over to visit their daughter in Berlin, he needs to get Piffl out again, convert him to Capitalism and present him as a fine young and noble husband in order to get his London post, and all of that very quick! \n[hr]\n\nDVD9 to DVD5\nDVDDecrypter-DVDRebuilder-CCE\n- Reduction Level for DVD-5: 60,6%\n- Overall Bitrate : 4.622Kbs\n- Space for Video : 3.525.364KB\nPAL - 16:9\nDDigital Mono: Spanish, english, french, german and italian.\nSubs.: French, dutch, swedish, finnish, and greek.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4002f65ca59b272fff5f4ef2b59524fed3928865","amp;dn":"One%2C+Two%2C+Three+-+1961","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4002f65ca59b272fff5f4ef2b59524fed3928865","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,2,246,92,165,155,39,47,255,95,78,242,181,149,36,254,211,146,136,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
