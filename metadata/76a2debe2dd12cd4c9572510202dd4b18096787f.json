In 1986 for their third album, they worked with producer Bob Ezrin, known for his work with Alice Cooper, Kiss and Pink Floyd. What resulted was change to a much more layered sound with a harder edge. While technically the group was down to a trio, Ezrin had a huge cast of players on the album. A gallery of guitar players appeared including Ted Nugent on &quot;Trash&quot; and David Gilmour on &quot;Pink And Velvet&quot;. Other guitarists credited include Elliot Easton of The Cars, Kane Roberts from Alice Cooper and Alan Murphy, known for playing on Kate Bush's albums. \n\nThe result was an interesting album artistically, but a disappointment in sales. &quot;Take My Breath Away&quot; from the movie &quot;Top Gun&quot; reached #1 on the US/UK charts. However it was written and produced by Giorgio Moroder and not really like the rest of the album. Their record label wasn't very happy with the new direction (or the poor sales obviously) either. Berlin soon broke up after this album. Terri Nunn still plays a few shows here and there as Berlin, but with none of the original members.\n\nBerlin - Count Three And Pray\n\n \n\n1986/MP3@320/110MB\n\nJohn Crawford - Bass, Background Vocals\nTerri Nunn - Vocals\nRob Brill - Drums, Background Vocals\n\nplus\n\nGuitars - Gene Black, Kane Roberts, David Gilmour, Ted Nugent, Alan Murphy, Elliot Easton, Steve Dougherty, Gregg Wright\n\nKeyboards - Bob Ezrin, Peter Robinson, Greg Kuehn, Jun Sato, Matt Reid\n\nBackground Vocals - John Lee Batdorf, William Batstone, Lance Ellington, George Merrill, Tessa Niles, The Art Damage Choir\n\nFretless Bass on &quot;Pink and Velvet&quot; - Patrick O'Hearn\n\n1.
