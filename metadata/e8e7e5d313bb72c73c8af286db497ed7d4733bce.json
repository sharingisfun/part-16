Rush - Published on Amazon.com\n\nGrinding, crunching rhythm guitars, fantastic soloing, heavy bass and drums, and a vocalist who reminds me of Blue Oyster Cult. Another hour of jamming, like on Axeman Cometh, but heavier. The vocals aren't the only thing about Wicked Lady that remind me of BOC, but I think this rocks harder. Raw sound, just like the first disc, but it doesn't distract from the music. Amazing obscure treasure. That product description about the nuns is totally off the wall, though. Who posts this crap? It's about as bad as the description on Asterix.\n\nThe first cut is like a Motorhead song (and this is 1972!). Their version of Hendrix's Voodoo Chile (Slight Return) sounds like Sabbath on acid. The rest of the album should at least appeal to anyone who likes Pentagram First Days Here, and to most fans of Sabbath and B.O.C. Also anyone interested in early doom metal. I know people are always saying &quot;it's as heavy as Sabbath&quot; and you buy the disc and think &quot;yea right!&quot; This time it comes really close. Not slick and polished like a Sabbath album, but this is the real deal. Get it!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n\n5.0 out of 5 stars 70s fan 11 Sep 2012 \n\nIf your a fan of 70s rock then you will love this album.
