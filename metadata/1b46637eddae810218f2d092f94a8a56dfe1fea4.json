(Wiley-VCH, 2008).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-3-527-31718-9\r\n\r\nThis ready reference is the first to collate the interdisciplinary knowledge from materials science, bioengineering and nanotechnology to give an in-depth overview of the topic. As such, it provides broad coverage of combinations between inorganic materials and such key biological structures as proteins, enzymes, DNA, or biopolymers. With its treatment of various application directions, including bioelectronic interfacing, tissue repair, porous membranes, sensors, nanocontainers, and DNA engineering, this is essential reading for materials engineers, medical researchers, catalytic chemists, biologists, and those working in the biotechnological and semiconductor industries","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b46637eddae810218f2d092f94a8a56dfe1fea4","amp;dn":"Bio-inorganic+Hybrid+Nanomaterials+-+E.+Ruiz-Hitzky+et+al.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b46637eddae810218f2d092f94a8a56dfe1fea4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,70,99,126,221,174,129,2,24,242,208,146,249,74,138,86,223,225,254,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
