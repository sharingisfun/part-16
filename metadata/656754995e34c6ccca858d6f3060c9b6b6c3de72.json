What Sitcoms Say About America Now\nSat 27 Oct 2012 22:00\nBBC HD\n\nSize: 577,263,616 bytes (550.521 MB)\nPlay duration: 00:58:55\nXviD\nmp3\nDigital cable tv\n\nDuring a presidential election campaign, it is easy to\nthink that Americans are all at each other's throats.\n\nHistorian and journalist Tim Stanley, for whom America\nis a second home, believes there's another America out\nthere and the best guide to the country is its sitcoms.\n\nWith the help of top sitcom writers and some of the\nbest examples of their work, he uncovers a fast-changing\nnation that can often leave the politicians scrabbling\nto catch up.\n\nRanging from South Park to The Cosby Show, Family Guy\nto Will and Grace, The Simpsons to Ellen, Tim explores\nhow sitcoms mirror American life, and shows how they\ncan help us understand what Americans think on issues\nlike race, religion, gay rights, abortion and the economy.\nThe current smash hit Modern Family has got teen sex, a\nmixed race marriage and a gay couple bringing up an\nadopted baby. While hilarious, it also reflects real life\nand the attitudes of modern Americans.\n\nBarack Obama and Mitt Romney say they're fighting for\nrival visions of America, yet the sitcoms and their\nwriters reveal a country that's far more complex,\nsurprising - and funny.\n\n**********\n**********\n\nTHIS IS MY OWN DIGITAL CABLE TV RECORDING AND ENCODE.\n\nIF YOU WANT THE INFERIOR X264 VERSION, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.\n\nDON'T COMPLAIN.
