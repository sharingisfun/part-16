While living quite comfortably in the wilderness along the Mississippi, Huck encounters Miss Watson's slave Jim on an island called Jackson's Island. Huck learns that Jim has also run away after he overheard Miss Watson's plan to sell Jim downriver, where conditions for slaves were even harsher, because he would bring a price of $800.\n\n Thank you Author for Amazing BOOK","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9194831502e865c5fa277512825c89b1bdf7037f","amp;dn":"The+Adventures+of+Huckleberry+Finn-+Mark+Twain.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9194831502e865c5fa277512825c89b1bdf7037f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,148,131,21,2,232,101,197,250,39,117,18,130,92,137,177,189,247,3,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
