The films in this series have in common an &quot;elegiac mood&quot;. Moscow Elegy was originally intended to mark Andreii Tarkovsky's 50th birthday. But disagreements within the Soviet Professional Union of Cinematographers about the style and content of the film forced us to suspend production for a long time and the film was only completed after his death. This &quot;birthday gift&quot; was to be a dramatic event in my cinema career.\n\nThe film is a subjective perception of the personality of the great film-maker and his destiny in the context of History. Let me add that our task was to create a special human approach towards the memory and personality of Tarkovsky. We attempted to treat the footage in a tender and caring way, with kindness. We were not trying to embrace all aspects of Tarkovsky's life and work. We are speaking only about what he has left in his Motherland, and what was going on during those years in the West, where he had had to work.&quot;\nAlexander Sokurov \n\nRussian audio, English, spanish, italian, french .idx and .srt portuguese subs\n\nPLEASE SEED!\n\nFile Name .........................................: Aleksandr Sokurov - Moscow elegy.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 928,956,416 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 01:26:16\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD\nFrame Size ......................................: 608x448 (AR: 1.357)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1327 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.195 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055(MP3, ISO) MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 100 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
