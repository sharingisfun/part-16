He builds it in Devon, linking two towns, Barnstaple and Bideford, which last had a train service over forty years ago.\n\nThousands of people turn out to help, but how will James's childhood model train cope in the pouring rain, with leaves on the line and every bit of mud in the way the scaled-up size of a boulder?\n\nHis old friend and railway enthusiast Oz Clarke turns up to lend a hand, but nature and the odds look to be against the plucky little engine in what is probably James's most ambitious idea yet.\n\n(James.May.Toy.Stories.S01E06.Hornby.DVDRip.XviD-KAREEM)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b229437dca7f7fe1099d6417d7729d79a5015f0a","amp;dn":"James+May%5C%27s+Toy+Stories+1x6+Hornby","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b229437dca7f7fe1099d6417d7729d79a5015f0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,41,67,125,202,127,127,225,9,157,100,23,215,114,157,121,165,1,95,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
