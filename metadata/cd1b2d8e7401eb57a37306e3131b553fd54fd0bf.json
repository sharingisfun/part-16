Moving away from the folky vibe of his debut Western Transport, Irwin has injected a lo-fi electro quality into his new material. In the artistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own words: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Unreal is all about rubbery hooks, soap box vocals, and slow groove, with the nightclub vibes of a weird dream.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nThat feel begins immediately with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Everything Passed Me ByÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and carries through the album. Tracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Face Value,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Michigan MiamiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Walls Around NothingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are awash in synthetic sounds, but the lyrics remain genuine and the vocals sincere throughout the record. \nIrwin maintained complete control over the album, engineering and playing almost everything, meticulously layering sound atop sound and piecing together the final product. He did get some help laying down backing tracks from his former band the Moment. \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a fiction, a studio-as-instrument album through and through, where the tired line between synthetic and organic is beside the point,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ reads a press release about the new record. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It oscillates between maximal and minimal with choral layers of harmonies and synths Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ giving way to sparse moments of focus and simplicity.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nEach song is written from a different characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perspective, giving Irwin the opportunity to explore a wide range of ideas. The same press release amusingly notes: Ã¢â‚¬Å“He sounds at times like a crankier Paul Simon, a deflowered Sam Cooke, or a less cryptic Cass McCombs.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nRating 7.8/10 \n\nTracklist: \n01 Everything Passed Me By.flac \n02 Did You Hear Who Shot Sam.flac \n03 Face Value.flac \n04 Michigan Miami.flac \n05 Blood Going Back in Time.flac \n06 Siberia China.flac \n07 Walls Around Nothing.flac \n08 A Wave Is a Wild Thing.flac \n09 Sahra.flac \n\n\nSummary: \nCountry: Canada \nGenre: indie-folk, Indie-Pop \n\n\nMedia Report: \nSource : CD \nFormat : FLAC \nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM \nBit rate mode : Variable \nBit rate : ~784-905 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz \nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd1b2d8e7401eb57a37306e3131b553fd54fd0bf","amp;dn":"%282015%29+James+Irwin+-+Unreal+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd1b2d8e7401eb57a37306e3131b553fd54fd0bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,27,45,142,116,1,235,87,163,115,6,227,19,27,85,63,213,79,208,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
