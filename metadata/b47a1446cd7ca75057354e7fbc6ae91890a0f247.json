As a songwriter, he pioneered several different schools of pop songwriting, from confessional singer/songwriter to winding, hallucinatory, stream-of-conscious narratives. As a vocalist, he broke down the notions that in order to perform, a singer had to have a conventionally good voice, thereby redefining the role of vocalist in popular music. As a musician, he sparked several genres of pop music, including electrified folk-rock and country-rock. And that just touches on the tip of his achievements. Dylan's force was evident during his height of popularity in the '60s -- the Beatles' shift toward introspective songwriting in the mid-'60s never would have happened without him -- but his influence echoed throughout several subsequent generations. Many of his songs became popular standards, and his best albums were undisputed classics of the rock &amp; roll canon. Dylan's influence throughout folk music was equally powerful, and he marks a pivotal turning point in its 20th century evolution, signifying when the genre moved away from traditional songs and toward personal songwriting. Even when his sales declined in the '80s and '90s, Dylan's presence was calculable. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:0ifrxqe5ldhe~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:0ifrxqe5ldhe~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nReview\tby William Ruhlmann\n\nBob Dylan's first greatest-hits album was released in 1967, and his second in 1971. Twenty-three years later came his third, and it's a reasonable compilation of the better-known songs he produced over the period, notably standards like &quot;Knockin' on Heaven's Door&quot; and &quot;Forever Young,&quot; Dylan chart hits like &quot;Tangled up in Blue&quot; and &quot;Hurricane,&quot; songs that have been covered extensively by other singers, such as &quot;Ring Them Bells,&quot; and some of the better album tracks, such as &quot;Changing of the Guard&quot; and &quot;Brownsville Girl.&quot; In an effort to span the period, a few lesser, later songs such as &quot;Silvio&quot; and &quot;Under the Red Sky&quot; are included, while some stronger, earlier songs are not (&quot;Simple Twist of Fate,&quot; &quot;Senor,&quot; &quot;Emotionally Yours,&quot; and &quot;Everything Is Broken&quot;). But on the whole, the selection is excellent, and this is the album to get for that Dylan fan who stopped listening to him at the end of the '60s. (Includes the previously unreleased 1989 track &quot;Dignity.&quot;) \n\nTrack List:\n\n01. Tangled Up In Blue\n02. Changing Of The Guards\n03. The Groom's Still Waiting At The Altar\n04.
