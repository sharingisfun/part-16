Track information and cover art may not be available for all of them.\n\nTo prevent the problems with tag corruption that plagued my last attempt to share this fine old music with you, I \n\nhave wrapped each torrent into a single .rar file. I will be seeding five of them, so be sure to amaze your friends \n\nand collect them all.  :D\n\nThis torrent includes:\n\nCarmina Burana, discs 1 through 3 (Rene Clemencic Consort)\n\nAll are high quality rips at 320 kB or better! Enjoy -- and keep seeding!\n\n-- Rivenshield","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f0ccb723dc80ce1a9ceafcb4e6a6fb314cea671","amp;dn":"Music+of+the+Middle+Ages+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f0ccb723dc80ce1a9ceafcb4e6a6fb314cea671","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,12,203,114,61,200,12,225,169,206,175,203,78,106,111,179,20,206,166,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
