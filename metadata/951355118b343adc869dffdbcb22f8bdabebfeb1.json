It is not a peer-reviewed scientific journal, but it is read by both scientists and non-scientists, as a way of keeping track of developments outside their own fields of study or areas of interest. The magazine also regularly includes features, news and commentary on environmental issues, such as climate change.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:951355118b343adc869dffdbcb22f8bdabebfeb1","amp;dn":"New+Scientist+Magazine+-+2010+Full+Collection+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"951355118b343adc869dffdbcb22f8bdabebfeb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,19,85,17,139,52,58,220,134,157,255,219,203,34,248,189,171,235,254,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
