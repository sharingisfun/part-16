Torrent contains a self-extractor you just need to run and a link to a tutorial that'll talk you through what you gotta do for it to run properly. Also contains a link to a site containing various patches and drivers you may need to &quot;personalize&quot; your VM.\n\nPerfect for XCode, installs via the App Store. Contains like every fix possible, and should run as a real Mac. Can contact me if you need help (my email is included in the torrent). I'd recommend an email rather than commenting on here if it's urgent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8fc937de178e249e3d95d87f7f3da78531fd7c6","amp;dn":"OS+X+10.8+Mountain+Lion+DP+VMware+Image","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8fc937de178e249e3d95d87f7f3da78531fd7c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,252,147,125,225,120,226,73,227,217,93,135,247,243,218,120,83,31,215,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
