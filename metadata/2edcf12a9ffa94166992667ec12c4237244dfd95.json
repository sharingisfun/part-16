Except his time-travelling super-armor isn't designed to save the day, but to eliminate Tony Stark, since he believes Tony will be responsible for a catastrophe that will affect the year 2099.[25] Now Tony must take down his own futuristic grandson with the help of Hawkeye and S.H.I.E.L.D. while avoiding the future disaster at the same time!\n NOTE: Originally this episode was to be broadcast on March 28th before &quot;Control-Alt-Delete&quot; episode as reported by Nicktoons.\n(This is wrong, this is the episode released on 28th march)\n NOTE 2: Hawkeye and Black Widow team back up though on the hero side instead of as thieves as originally introduced.\n NOTE 3: Spiderman is specifically confirmed to exist in this reality by a Maggia soldier when Hawkeye uses a net arrow who mistakes Hawkeye's net \nfor Spiderman's webbing. Hawkeye introduces himself as the &quot;Friendly Neighborhood Hawkeye&quot; to them. Black Widow uses the famous Spiderman line \n(usually to Doc Ock) &quot;You should know spiders are NOT insects.&quot; Spiderman does not appear on-screen. \n\n[b]Encoders Note:[/b] Sorry about the skipped frames in the 1st version, I thought I'd fixed it but I've now done a \ncomplete re-capture and encode which I've checked right the way through.\n=-=-=-=\nh**p://www.imdb.com/title/tt0837143/\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\nScreenshots\n--------------\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 180M\nPlayTime           : 00:23:55.226\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : XVID\nVideoWidth         : 720 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 420 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 23.976fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 34411\nVideoBitRate       : 915862\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : MP3\nAudioBitRate       : 128000\nAudioChannels      : 2\nAudioSampleRate    : 48000\nformat: avi\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\nHash\n------\n2EDCF12A9FFA94166992667EC12C4237244DFD95\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2edcf12a9ffa94166992667ec12c4237244dfd95","amp;dn":"Iron+Man+Armored+Adventures+-+218+-+Iron+Man+2099+Proper+%5BOj%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2edcf12a9ffa94166992667ec12c4237244dfd95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,220,241,42,159,250,148,22,105,146,102,126,193,44,66,55,36,77,253,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
