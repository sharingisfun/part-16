Ben also contributed to the soundtrack of the DreamWorks animated film Over the Hedge.\n\n\n\nBen Folds Five is an alternative rock trio formed in 1993 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The group comprises Ben Folds (vocals, piano, and principal songwriting), Robert Sledge (bass guitar, synthesizers, and backing vocals), and Darren Jessee (drums, backing vocals and co-writer for some songs). The group achieved mainstream success in the alternative, indie and pop music scenes. The band is best known for the hit single &quot;Brick&quot; from their 1997 album Whatever and Ever Amen, which gained airplay on many mainstream radio stations.\n\nMuch of Ben Folds Five's work was influenced by jazz, evident in frequent improv-styled passages through bridge and/or ending. During their seven years together, the band released three proper studio records, one retrospective album of B-sides and outtakes, and eight singles. They also contributed to a number of soundtracks and compilations. Ben Folds Five disbanded in October 2000, apparently under amicable circumstances.\n\nThe group reunited for a one-off concert on September 18, 2008, where they played their final album, The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner, in its entirety. In 2011, Ben Folds Five reunited to record three tracks for Ben Folds' The Best Imitation of Myself: A Retrospective. It has been announced that the group will be reconvening in December of 2011 to record a new album.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Folds&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Folds&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Folds_Five&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Folds_Five&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFifty-Five Vault is a Ben Folds compilation album featuring 56 tracks, mostly unreleased live recordings and demos.
