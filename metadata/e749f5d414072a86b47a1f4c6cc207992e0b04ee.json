Unlike the compressed singer-in-a-studio sound of his early recordings, FLYIN' SHOES features sympathetic, organic backing from greats like Chips Moman, Jimmy Day Spooner Oldham. This helps Townes' subtly poetic tunes to come across. &quot;When She Don't Need Me&quot; and &quot;No Place to Fall&quot; are elegant love songs that depart form the country-folk style in the manner of DELTA MOMMA BLUES' &quot;You Are Not Needed Now.&quot; &quot;Snake Song,&quot; &quot;Dollar Bill Blues&quot; and &quot;Rex's Blues&quot; are classic Townes; dark, incisive imagery and simple-but-effective folk-tinged melodies. The title tune is a beautiful ballad that casts a hopeful eye toward spiritual redemption.\n\nAll tracks have been digitally remastered.\n\nRecorded at American Studios, Nashville, Tennessee. Includes liner notes by Tom Terrell.\n\nPersonnel: Townes Van Zandt (vocals, acoustic guitar); Chips Moman, Philip Donnelly (acoustic guitar, electric guitar, background vocals); Randy Scruggs (acoustic guitar, mandolin); Billy Earl McClellan (acoustic guitar, background vocals); Jimmy Day (steel guitar); Gary Scruggs (harmonica); Spooner Oldham (piano); Bobby Emmons (keyboards); Tommy Cogbill (bass guitar); Eddy Anderson (drums, percussion); Toni Wine, Billy Burnette (background vocals).\n\nPersonnel: Townes Van Zandt (vocals, acoustic guitar); Phillip Donnelly, Billy Earl McLelland, Chips Moman (acoustic &amp; electric guitars, background vocals); Jimmy Day (steel guitar); Gary Scruggs (harmonica); Spooner Oldham (piano); Bobby Emmons (keyboards); Tommy Cogbill (bass); Eddy Anderson (drums, percussion); Toni Wine (background vocals).\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e749f5d414072a86b47a1f4c6cc207992e0b04ee","amp;dn":"Townes+Van+Zandt...Flyin%5C%27+Shoes%281978%29cdrip%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e749f5d414072a86b47a1f4c6cc207992e0b04ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,73,245,212,20,7,42,134,180,122,31,76,108,194,7,153,46,11,4,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
