Who better to author\nit than Andy Rebmann, Dr. Edward David, and Dr. Marcella Sorg?\nI first met Andy in 1980.

His easy-going nature fit nicely\nwith the positive methods of canine training. During my career with\nthe Maine State Police, administering and training for the canine unit\nfrom 1979 to 1986, one of the schools I attended was a canine narcotic\ndetection school that Andy instructed.
