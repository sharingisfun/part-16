Now deeply enmeshed in the Northern Ireland peace process, Rogelio Alonso asks why one of the bloodiest terrorist movements of our time decide to swap weapons for the ballot box?\n\nBased on over seventy interviews conducted with former and existing members of the IRA, Alonso also provides a rigorous evaluation of the personal and political consequences of the IRAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s campaign of violence. The analysis of these interviews radically challenges the dominant academic analysis of Irish terrorism. This book includes a strong criticism of the armed struggle constructed around the discourse of those who waged it and answers the question faced by many armed revolutionary movements: Ã¢â‚¬ËœWas the war worth it?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nTranslated from the critically acclaimed Matar por Irlanda and available in English for the first time, this is a provocative and new approach to understanding the IRA. It is essential reading for readers and researchers with an interest in Irish politics and history, terrorism and political violence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa8747e2761246ba91f883e3ce9815e46761d4ae","amp;dn":"Rogelio+Alonso+-+The+IRA+And+Armed+Struggle+%28mobi+%2B+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa8747e2761246ba91f883e3ce9815e46761d4ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,135,71,226,118,18,70,186,145,248,131,227,206,152,21,228,103,97,212,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
