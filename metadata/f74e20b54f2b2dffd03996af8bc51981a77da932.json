Deckadance itself can also host \nany VST compliant softsynth or effect. \n\nControl Deckadance using your mouse, keyboard, midi controller, timecoded vinyl \nand/or CD system. No other DJ software supports more control formats and is as \ncommitted to 3rd party controller support as Deckadance.  \n \nImage-Line, the company behind Deckadance, has more than 10 years experience \ndeveloping and managing class-leading audio software such as FL Studio. During \nDeckadance's development, we didn't just bring in some  consulting DJs to tell \nour software engineers what they wanted. Deckadance was written by DJs for DJs,  \nso we are confident that it will take your DJing to the next level with features \nthat make total sense.  \n             \nOf course, if you suck as a DJ, you will still suck using Deckadance, but you \nwill suck better, faster, harder and more creatively than ever before! \n\n\n\nDeckadance Featurelist:\n \nMixing: \nBeat analysis, beat matching, time stretching, pitch shifting, bass x-fades, \nand user-assignable x-fade curves are all possible. Deckadance supports MP3, \nWAV and OGG formats.\n\nMIDI control: \nDeckadance comes with pre-configured setups for working with the Vestax VCI-100, \nBehringer (BCD2000 &amp; 3000), Allen &amp; Heath Xone:3D, M-Audio XSession, Hercules DJ \nConsole (MP3 &amp; MK II), EKS XP10 , Kontrol-DJ. All other controllers will work in \nGeneric mode or via custom links which can be made with the MIDI learn feature \nand saved for future recall.\n\nVinyl control: \nThe following Time Code Vinyls and CDs have been certified to work with Deckadance:\nStanton FinalScratch, Serato Scratch Live, MixVibes, and msPinky. All other vinyls and timecode CDs can be 'learnt' using the inbuilt Deckadance Time Code calibration system.\n\nSampler: \nEight integrated sampler banks can load or record 1, 2, 4 or 8 beat loops from \none of the decks (freely assignable). Samples can be triggered on-the-fly or \nbeat-synced with the associated deck.\n\nReLooping: \nThe Deckadance Relooper features the ability to re-slice any beat-analyzed track \nand re-arrange the beat. The Relooper includes a set of master effects for added \ncustomization of the sound and can be used to create stutter effects, or to extend \ninfinite parts of a track to create unique breaks, intros or outros. The Relooper \nalso supports unique loop and leap features which allow the track to continue from \nthe point it would have reached if no loop had occurred.\n\nVST host: \nDeckadance can host eight VST instruments or effects. These can be assigned to \neither deck, and are located in the signal path between the decks and the master \noutputs. Instruments may be driven by MIDI sequences to create unique live \nsequenced tracks. Included with Deckadance are the Image-Line JuicePack effects \nincluding: Love Philter, Parametric EQ &amp; EQ2, Wave Candy, Multiband Compressor, \nDelay, Delay Bank, WaveShaper, EQUO (graphic morphing EQ), Flangus, Vocoder, \nSpectroman and Stereo Enhancer plugins.\n\nVSTi plugin: \nDeckadance can be loaded as a VST inside any VST-compliant host, such as FL Studio,\nAbleton Live, Sonar or Cubase.\n\nPlaylist: \nWorking with the integrated file browser, the Playlist allows sets to be arranged \nand tested before the gig, including cue points, loops and beat-markers. Complete \nwith 'DJ-Style Automix' function (using Bass crossfades) even the laziest of DJs, \nor those who need to visit the bathroom, are catered for.\n\nDMX: \nDigital Multiplex lighting control standard is a communications protocol,\nsimilar to MIDI. However, DMX may be used to control lighting, dimmers and \nother DMX-enabled equipment such as fog-machines. The Deckadance DMX Sequencer \nis an optional module to be released soon.\n\nSkins: \nDeckadance ships with a Dark and Light skin. The skin bitmaps are freely editable \nso users can create or customize their own. New skins will also be downloadable \nfrom the Deckadance website shortly.\n\nKey DSP and Technical: \nASIO-compliant, 64-bit DSP, pristine quality processing.

Sometimes also they're \n    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not \n    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack \n    or folder from being auto-protected &amp; auto-scanned by the AV software.\n\n03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored \n    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).\n\n04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.\n\n06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies \n    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n\n09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n11- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n13- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my account*:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n*All torrents scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security  \n2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  \n3- AVG Antivirus Pro   \n4- Kaspersky AV Pro  \n5- NOD32 AV  \n\nAlso scanned with reputed antispyware software. Reported malware \ndetected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at January 27, 2010 - 03.30 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f74e20b54f2b2dffd03996af8bc51981a77da932","amp;dn":"Image+Line+Deckadance+Club+Edition+v1.62+%2B+RegKey+%28AiR%29+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f74e20b54f2b2dffd03996af8bc51981a77da932","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,78,32,181,79,43,45,255,208,57,150,175,139,197,25,129,167,125,169,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
