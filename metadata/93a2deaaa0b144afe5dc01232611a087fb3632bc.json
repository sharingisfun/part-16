But like pieces of a broken window, the shards of the past can be dangerous and razor-sharp, and sometimes the truth goes deeper than anyone would want. And for the Spectral Avenger, a past revealed may mean a future destroyed.\n\nCreators\n\nWriters: Chris Warner, Mike Kennedy\nPencillers: Christian Zanier, Ryan Benjamin, Chris Brunner\nInkers: Ryan Benjamin, Chris Brunner, Steve Moncuse\nColorists: Chris Chalenor, Dan Jackson\nCover Artist: Den Beauvais\n\nGenre: Superhero\n\nPublication Date: February 20, 2013\nFull Color, 280 pages\nAge range: 14","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93a2deaaa0b144afe5dc01232611a087fb3632bc","amp;dn":"GHOST+OMNIBUS+4+%282013%29+%28Dark+Horse%29+%28digital%29+%28Son+of+Ultron-Emp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93a2deaaa0b144afe5dc01232611a087fb3632bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,162,222,170,160,177,68,175,229,220,1,35,38,17,160,135,251,54,50,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
