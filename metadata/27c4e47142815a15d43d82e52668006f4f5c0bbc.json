But when Julia meets Louise, a troubled young woman with a checkered past, all JuliaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s old psychic wounds painfully resurface, as does her illogical and increasingly irrational hope that Louise may be the daughter she lost so long ago.\n\nGenre: Drama\nIMDB rating: 6.5/10 (1,628 votes)\nDirected by: David Auburn\nDirected by: Sigourney Weaver, Kate Bosworth, Alessandro Nivola, Keri Russell\n\nNOTE: I watched that movie few years back.
