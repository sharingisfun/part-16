Built in 1895 by the Snowdon Mountain Tramroad &amp; Hotels Company, it is usually best remembered for the tragic accident that occurred on the first day of public operation in 1896. It overcame that awful event and has established a well-earned place as one of the most popular tourist railways in Wales. Unusual among Britain's passenger-carrying railways, the Snowdon Mountain Railway was built without Parliamentary authority on private land, a situation that limits the amount of historical information available in public archives. Research carried out by railway historian Peter Johnson has uncovered many new insights into the railway's fascinating history. Stunning scenery and a unique railway combine to make this a fascinating book that will appeal to railway enthusiasts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22d02751bcf077e0eeac196f878dffd0b91bc149","amp;dn":"An+Illustrated+History+of+the+Snowdon+Mountain+Railway+%28Oxford%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22d02751bcf077e0eeac196f878dffd0b91bc149","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,208,39,81,188,240,119,224,238,172,25,111,135,141,255,208,185,27,193,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
