Using PhoneGap, developers can build native mobile apps using standard HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS, and then deploy those apps to every leading mobile platform with little or no recoding. Up to now, though, PhoneGap was lacking complete, practical documentation. PhoneGap Essentials fills that void: ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the first concise, yet complete, tutorial for succeeding with PhoneGap in real-world development.\n\n\nExperienced mobile developer John M. Wargo thoroughly introduces the PhoneGap platform, explaining what it is, what it does, and how it works. He then guides you through configuring PhoneGap environmentsÃ¢â‚¬â€creating complete mobile appsÃ¢â‚¬â€and building them for the Google AndroidÃ¢â€žÂ¢, Samsung bada, BlackBerryÃ‚Â® devices, AppleÃ‚Â® iOS, SymbianÃ¢â€žÂ¢ OS, and WindowsÃ‚Â® Phone. Through realistic examples, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll master key PhoneGap APIs for everything from GPS to the file system, contacts to camera, device to events, and more. Wargo also demonstrates how to take full advantage of PhoneGap Build, PhoneGapÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cloud-based packaging utility.\n\n\n\nCoverage includes\n\nThe anatomy of a PhoneGap application (what makes an application a PhoneGap application)\nUnderstanding the impact of cross-platform development issues\nExploring the entire PhoneGap development process, including testing and debugging\nExpanding PhoneGapÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s capabilities with third-party development tools and plug-ins\nBuilding cross-platform apps that use the device camera, compass, accelerometer, and other hardware\nReading from and writing to the contacts database and the device file system\nInstalling tools needed to develop PhoneGap apps for Android, bada, BlackBerry, iOS, Symbian, and Windows Phone\nReacting to events and notifying users\nUsing the Media API to record and play media files\nBuilding for multiple platforms simultaneously using PhoneGap Build\n\n\n\nPaperback: 384 pages\n \nPublisher: Addison-Wesley Professional; 1 edition (June 11, 2012)\n \nAuthor(s): John M.
