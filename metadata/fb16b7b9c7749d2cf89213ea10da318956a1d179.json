Do you often find yourself spending a lot of time to rearrange charts generated by pelting or do you need to modify UV maps because the proportions of the UV space or the size of the required padding have changed? UV-Packer does it with a single click of a button. It can also rescale the separate UV charts depending on the mesh surface area to even out the pixel distribution across different parts of the mesh.\n\nUV-Packer has been released in version 1.11 for Autodesk 3ds Max.\n\nWith version 1.11 UV-Packer now offers full support for 3ds Max 2012 and 3ds Max Design 2012 (each in 32 bit and 64 bit versions).\n- Added support for Autodesk 3ds Max 2012 and Autodesk 3ds Max Design 2012 (each in 32 bit and 64 bit versions).\n\n- Minor technical issues fixed.\n\nUV-Packer 1.11 is compatible with:\n\n* 3ds MAX 2012 32 bit\n* 3ds MAX 2012 64 bit\n* 3ds MAX 2011 32 bit\n* 3ds MAX 2011 64 bit\n* 3ds MAX 2010 32 bit\n* 3ds MAX 2010 64 bit\n\n\nRequirements\n\n* Microsoft .NET 2.0 installed\n* Microsoft DirectX 9.0c\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb16b7b9c7749d2cf89213ea10da318956a1d179","amp;dn":"UV+Packer+1.11+%28incl.3dsMax+2012+support%29+%28x86%2Fx64%29+%5Bak%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb16b7b9c7749d2cf89213ea10da318956a1d179","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,22,183,185,199,116,157,44,248,146,19,234,16,218,49,137,86,161,209,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
