Hugh Padgham recorded and co-produced this album, a man known for his work for The Police, Genesis etc. While listening to this album, occasionally, Prefab Sprout come to my mind. As the title suggests, the mood of the album is one of nostalgia. Considering the hippie-esque touch of the music, its focus seems to be the &quot;magical&quot; days of the late sixties. On Side One, the band reveals its considerable talents for songwriting. The arrangements are not dated at all, mainly due to the reliance on acoustic instruments, such as oboe, trumpet and acoustic guitar. At the bottom line, Remembrance Days is a fine Pop album. It would be a pity if it were buried in oblivion.\n \n\nTrack Listings\n1. Indian Summer  \n2. Lesson of Love  \n3. Humdrum  \n4. Power to Believe  \n5. Hampstead Girl  \n6. Here  \n7.
