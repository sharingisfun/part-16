Glidden \nHardcover: 250 pages\nPublisher: Praeger (March 31, 2015)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1440835195\nISBN-13: 978-1440835193\nNOTE: This is the standalone ebook and may not include access codes that come packaged with the bound book\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nThe always-controversial practice of judicial review of Congress is not prescribed in the Constitution, but is arguably a valid way to protect the rights of individuals or guard against unfair rule by the majority. This book offers a historical review and indictment of the Supreme Court's overruling of Congress, ultimately taking a position that this has been more detrimental than beneficial to the democratic process in the United States, and that in the aggregate rights of individuals and minorities would have been better served if the relevant laws of Congress had been enforced rather than struck down by the Court.\n\nWritten by an author who is a historian and a lawyer, the book covers all Supreme Court overrides of Congress through 2014, including major historical turning points in Supreme Court legislation and such recent and relevant topics as the Affordable Care Act, limits on contributions to political candidates and campaigns from wealthy individuals, and the Defense of Marriage Act. The discussions of specific cases are made in relevant context and focus on &quot;big picture&quot; themes and concepts without skipping key details, making this a useful volume for law and university level students while also being accessible to general readers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6efaae39881d816c79753cbefd6488a6a4dc0400","amp;dn":"The+Supreme+Court+versus+Congress%2C+Glidden+%5BPDF%5D%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6efaae39881d816c79753cbefd6488a6a4dc0400","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,250,174,57,136,29,129,108,121,117,60,190,253,100,136,166,164,220,4,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
