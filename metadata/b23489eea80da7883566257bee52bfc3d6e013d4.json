Throughout human existence, the poor have always \nbeen with us. Beginning with the Neolithic age, Ben Lewis's funny and sinister \nanimated odyssey takes us through the changing image of poverty - helping us \ndefine what poverty looks like today and question whether it is inevitable. \n\nA BBC Storyville film, produced in partnership with the Open University, Poor \nUs screens as part of Why Poverty? - when the BBC, in conjunction with more \nthan 70 broadcasters around the world, hosts a debate about contemporary \npoverty. The global cross-media event sees the same eight films screened in 180 \ncountries to explore why, in the 21st Century, a billion people still live in \npoverty.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b23489eea80da7883566257bee52bfc3d6e013d4","amp;dn":"BBC+Why+Poverty+5+of+8+Poor+Us%2C+An+Animated+History+Of+Poverty+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b23489eea80da7883566257bee52bfc3d6e013d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,52,137,238,168,13,167,136,53,102,37,123,238,82,191,195,214,224,19,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
