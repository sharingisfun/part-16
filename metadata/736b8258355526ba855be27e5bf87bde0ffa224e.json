Today it is still topping the charts and remains one of the longest-lived and most\nsuccessful forms of popular music.\n\nAs the band leader Artie Shaw said, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSwing is a verb, not an adjectiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ It is something you do.\nAn action, a rhythm, an energy, an attitude. Swing is the thing which, for over 80 years, has created\nthe greatest singers, musicians and records and which simply refuses to go away.\n\nNarrated by Kenneth Cranham, The Swing Thing combines commentary and archive footage of some of\nthe finest swing performers and performances of all time. It also examines the impact swing music\nhas had on American society: as a youth movement, a force for sexual liberation and a challenge to\nthe countrys racial divide.\n\n\n[img]http://nimga.com/m/7xCti.png[img]\n\n\n[img]http://nimga.com/f/HiVgp.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://nimga.com/f/9RgIW.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://nimga.com/f/cn6DV.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://nimga.com/f/TNcua.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://nimga.com/f/TLlgk.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://nimga.com/f/EIVfs.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://nimga.com/f/vk1Ux.png[/img]\n\n\n::General::\n\nFormat: MPEG-4\nFile Size: 917 MiB\nOverall Bit Rate: 1 432 Kbps\nDuration: 1h 29mn\nSample: No\nSubtitles: NO\n\n::Video Info::\n\nContainer: avc1\nVideo Codec Type: x264\nVideo bitrate: 1 200 Kbps\nResolution: 720 X 416 pixels\nAspect ratio(AR): 16:9\nQuality Factor(QF): 0.160\nFrame Rate: 25.000 fps\nSource: (oan)Thanks!!\n\n::Audio Info::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate Mode: Variable\nBitrate: 240 Kbps ((( 2 channels )))\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\nChannel positions: Front: L,R\n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/e27e/17a127b58.png[/img]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:736b8258355526ba855be27e5bf87bde0ffa224e","amp;dn":"BBC+-+The+Swing+Thing+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"736b8258355526ba855be27e5bf87bde0ffa224e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,107,130,88,53,85,38,186,133,91,226,126,91,248,123,222,15,250,34,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
