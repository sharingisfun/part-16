The album was their last before disbanding after drummer Razzle's death in a car accident on December 8, 1984.\n\nBefore this album, all of Hanoi Rocks' albums were released on Lick Records and Johanna Kustannus, but this was the band's first album on a major label, CBS. Originally the album was supposed to be called Silver Missiles And Nightingales, but the name was changed at the last minute. Andy McCoy and Nasty Suicide later used the name as the name of their album, when they worked under the moniker, &quot;The Suicide Twins&quot;.\n\n\nTracklist\n1. Up Around The Bend 3:10\n2.
