But full is full and why wait for two weeks. Even the unsorted list (I9: Music I like to pass but I could not fit in) has become too large and so happens to be the best I9 list ever. There is no track left I would like to replace. In short, all nine playlists have become a bit stronger than quite convincing. And all in excellent sound quality.... So I`m busy with July already....
