Van Herpen\n\nThis book offers the first systematic analysis of PutinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two wars, placing the Second Chechen War and the War with Georgia of 2008 in their broader historical contexts. Drawing on extensive original Russian sources, Marcel H. Van Herpen analyzes in detail how PutinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wars were prepared and conducted and why they led to allegations of war crimes and genocide. He shows how the conflicts functioned to consolidate and legitimate PutinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s regime and explores how they were connected to a third, hidden, Ã¢â‚¬Å“internal warÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ waged by the Kremlin against the opposition. The author convincingly argues that the KremlinÃ¢â‚¬â€relying on the secret services, the Orthodox Church, the Kremlin youth Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nashi,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the rehabilitated CossacksÃ¢â‚¬â€is preparing for an imperial revival, most recently in the form of a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Eurasian Union.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\nAn essential book for understanding the dynamics of PutinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s regime, this study digs deep into the KremlinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s secret long-term strategies. Readable and clearly argued, it makes a compelling case that PutinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s regime emulates an established Russian paradigm in which empire building and despotic rule are mutually reinforcing. As the first comprehensive exploration of the historical antecedents and political continuity of the KremlinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contemporary policies, Van HerpenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work will make a valuable contribution to the literature on postÃ¢â‚¬â€œSoviet Russia, and his arguments will stimulate vigorous debate.\n\n   About the Author:\n    Marcel H.
