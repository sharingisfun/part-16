Mr. Kaiser\r\nhas long worked with bassist Damon Smith and drummer Weasel Walter on many\r\nprevious sessions with and without other musicians, hence there is a special\r\nbond between them. Mr. Kaiser mentions in the liner notes that there are many\r\ndifferent styles of free improv (Downtown, British, Dutch, AACM, etc.) and that\r\nall three members are well aware of so what we hear is quite a bit of diversity\r\nin their explorations. This session is superbly recorded, clean, warm and\r\nconsistently fascinating. Unlike some of explosive, over-the-top jamming on\r\nVolume One, this session is often quite calm in part although they do break\r\nthrough and erupt at times. The ever-mighty Weasel Walter is in particularly\r\nfine form here, keeping several dialogues/conversations going on\r\nsimultaneously. He sounds as if he is playing toys or small hand percussion at\r\ntimes, weaving an infinite web of lines around one another. This is dynamic\r\nimprov at its very best!\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBy Glenn Astarita \nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/plane-crash-two-henry-kaiser-new-atlantis-records-review-by-glenn-astarita.php\r\n\r\nBy Grego Applegate Edwards","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d00d68d07c9616f8bc4eea56f8e000bc1c66a6f2","amp;dn":"Henry+Kaiser%2C+Damon+Smith%2C+Weasel+Walter+-Plane+Crash+Two+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d00d68d07c9616f8bc4eea56f8e000bc1c66a6f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,13,104,208,124,150,22,248,188,78,234,86,248,224,0,188,28,102,166,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
