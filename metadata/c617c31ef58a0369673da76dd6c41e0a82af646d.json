The old torrent will be deleted in a couple of days; everyone should switch to this torrent ASAP.\n\nFile Format: Matroska MKV\nVideo Codec: h264 AVC\nAudio Codec: AAC\n\n**FOR USERS OF THE OLD TORRENT**\n\nThe two &quot;unaired&quot; episodes were 403 and 404, meaning that all episode numbers from the existing 403 onward need to be increased by two in order to be able to resume the old torrent on this one.\n\nFor example,\n\n[K.o.R] Takeshi's Castle - 403 [h264][AAC][607C459F].mkv\n\nin the old batch will become\n\n[K.o.R] Takeshi's Castle - 405 [h264][AAC][607C459F].mkv\n\nin the new batch. Check and match up the CRCs in the new batch if you are not sure. Hopefully 2 minutes of renaming will save you from ~2 gigs of unnecessary re-downloading!\n\nEnjoy, and please help seed when you are done!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c617c31ef58a0369673da76dd6c41e0a82af646d","amp;dn":"%5BK.o.R%5D+Takeshi%5C%27s+Castle+-+Season+4+%28Complete+-+22%2F22%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c617c31ef58a0369673da76dd6c41e0a82af646d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,23,195,30,245,138,3,105,103,61,167,109,214,196,30,10,130,175,100,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
