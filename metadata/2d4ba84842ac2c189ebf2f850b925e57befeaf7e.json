Eckhout, who was court painter to the colonial governor of Dutch Brazil, created life-size paintings of Amerindians, Africans, and Brazilians of mixed race in support of the governorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s project to document the people and natural history of the colony. In this study, Rebecca Parker Brienen provides a detailed analysis of EckhoutÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s works, framing them with discussions of both their colonial context and contemporary artistic practices in the Dutch republic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d4ba84842ac2c189ebf2f850b925e57befeaf7e","amp;dn":"Visions+of+Savage+Paradise+-+Albert+Eckhout%2C+Court+Painter+in+Co","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d4ba84842ac2c189ebf2f850b925e57befeaf7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,75,168,72,66,172,44,24,158,191,47,133,11,146,94,87,190,254,175,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
