Michael Straczynski. The show centers on the Babylon 5 space station: a focal point for politics, diplomacy, and conflict in the late 2250s and early 2260s. With its prominent use of pre-planned story arcs, the series was often described as a &quot;novel for television.&quot;\n\nThe five seasons of the series each correspond to one fictional sequential year in the period 2258-2262. As the series starts, the Babylon 5 station is welcoming ambassadors from various races in the galaxy. Earth has just barely survived an accidental war with the powerful Minbari, who, despite their superior technology, mysteriously surrendered at the brink of the destruction of the human race (the Battle of the Line).\n\nDuring 2258, Commander Jeffrey Sinclair is in charge of the station. Much of the story revolves around his gradual discovery that it was his capture by the Minbari at the Battle of the Line which ended the war against Earth. Upon capturing Sinclair, the Minbari came to believe that Valen, a great Minbari leader and hero of the last Minbari-Shadow war, had been reincarnated as the Commander. Concluding that others of their species had been, and were being, reborn as humans, and in obedience to the edict that Minbari do not kill one another, they stopped the war just as Earth's final defenses were on the verge of collapse.\n\n\n--\n\nGetting all of Babylon 5, use those torrents:\n\nSeason 1: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170818/BABYLON_5_-_Season_1_DVDs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170818/BABYLON_5_-_Season_1_DVDs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSeason 2: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170821/BABYLON_5_-_Season_2_DVDs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170821/BABYLON_5_-_Season_2_DVDs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSeason 3: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170823/BABYLON_5_-_Season_3_DVDs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170823/BABYLON_5_-_Season_3_DVDs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSeason 4: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170829/BABYLON_5_-_Season_4_DVDs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170829/BABYLON_5_-_Season_4_DVDs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSeason 5: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170831/BABYLON_5_-_Season_5_DVDs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170831/BABYLON_5_-_Season_5_DVDs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMovies: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170833/BABYLON_5_-_Movies_DVDs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170833/BABYLON_5_-_Movies_DVDs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCrusade: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170835/BABYLON_5_-_Crusade_DVDs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170835/BABYLON_5_-_Crusade_DVDs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Lost Tales: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170840/BABYLON_5_-_The_Lost_Tales_DVDs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4170840/BABYLON_5_-_The_Lost_Tales_DVDs&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n--\n\n\nRecommended Watching Order:\n\n(1) The Gathering (Movie #1: Pilot Movie)\n(2) Season 1 - 5\n(3) The other movies\n(4) Crusade\n(5) The Lost Tales\n\n\n--\n\n\nMD5Sums for the ISOs:\n\n33fa5cd396dd7867efc58f255089439f  BABYLON5_SEASON1_DVDs/BABYLON5_SEASON1_DISC1.iso\naf9765e20bc65467ad9579e383248f7f  BABYLON5_SEASON1_DVDs/BABYLON5_SEASON1_DISC2.iso\n9726e8466203441048345b82ded47193  BABYLON5_SEASON1_DVDs/BABYLON5_SEASON1_DISC3.iso\n1ad720575ea3490ededc4c84c785fa20  BABYLON5_SEASON1_DVDs/BABYLON5_SEASON1_DISC4.iso\n7857e5873f9de9a1fc4c6822edd412ae  BABYLON5_SEASON1_DVDs/BABYLON5_SEASON1_DISC5.iso\n96b3e8046509a8124e534a4b52d6cbf3  BABYLON5_SEASON1_DVDs/BABYLON5_SEASON1_DISC6.iso\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30ec2a0784896eaf040e02e562236c5bd8284c36","amp;dn":"BABYLON+5+-+Season+1+DVDs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30ec2a0784896eaf040e02e562236c5bd8284c36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,236,42,7,132,137,110,175,4,14,2,229,98,35,108,91,216,40,76,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
