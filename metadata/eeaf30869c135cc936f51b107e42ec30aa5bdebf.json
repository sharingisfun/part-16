In this pared down, slapstick version of Shakespeare's comedy, Petruchio rides into town facing backwards on a jackass, strumming a lyre, looking for his fair-haired, soon-to-be-wife Katherine. The two engage in a battle of the sexes, complete with verbal sparring and pratfalls, until Katherine is brought down to size and made to be subservient to her loutish husband. Although disputed in John C. Tibbetts' book His Majesty, the American, legend has it that Samuel Taylor, the film's director who also adapted the screenplay, had the writer's credit read &quot;By William Shakespeare, with additional dialogue by Sam Taylor.&quot; The film was re-scored and re-edited (drastically shortening the film) in 1966.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020479/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020479/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Pickford&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Pickford&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDirector:\nSam Taylor\n\n\n        Mary Pickford\t ... \tKatherine\n\n\tDouglas Fairbanks... \tPetruchio\n\n\tEdwin Maxwell\t... \tBaptista\n\tJoseph Cawthorn\t... \tGremio\n\tClyde Cook\t... \tGrumio\n\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:05:00\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 384x288\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1446 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,54 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 1\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eeaf30869c135cc936f51b107e42ec30aa5bdebf","amp;dn":"The+Taming+of+the+Shrew+%281929%29+Mary+Pickford%2CDouglas+Fairbanks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eeaf30869c135cc936f51b107e42ec30aa5bdebf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,175,48,134,156,19,92,201,54,245,27,16,126,66,236,48,170,91,222,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
