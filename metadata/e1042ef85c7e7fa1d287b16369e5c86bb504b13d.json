To do so, they examined things such as a drop of water, explosions (many of them), gunshots, ballet dancing, cornflour, shallow water diving, X games and sometimes some uncanny things like piercing one's cheek or standing on blades.\n\nThe high speed cameras were used at as low as 500 frame/second for capturing how dogs drink to as high as 40,000 frame/second for capturing bullets, breaking glass, etc. Speeds above 20,000 frame/second were shot in black and white as the data for lightness and darkness is reduced when there is no color (hue) value to shoot. This is because the recording was digital and so the frame rate is limited to a certain data rate and black-and-white footage is much smaller (in memory space) than full color.\nTime Warp\n \n\nStarring\tJeff Lieberman\nMatt Kearney\n\nNo. of seasons\t2\nNo. of episodes\t34\n\nRunning time Season 1 = 22 minutes\nRunning time Season 2 = 44 minutes\n\n\nOriginal air dates\tMarch 18, 2008 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ October 28, 2009\n\n\nSeason 2 Episodes 9 and 10 are not of the best Quality\n\nThanks Milleman for some of the origional uploads","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1042ef85c7e7fa1d287b16369e5c86bb504b13d","amp;dn":"Time+Warp+-+The+Complete+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1042ef85c7e7fa1d287b16369e5c86bb504b13d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,4,46,248,92,126,127,161,210,135,177,99,105,229,200,107,181,4,177,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
