Pepper, no one seriously thought of rock music as actual art. That all changed in 1967, though, when John, Paul, George and Ringo (with &quot;A Little Help&quot; from their friend, producer George Martin) created an undeniable work of art which remains, after 30-plus years, one of the most influential albums of all time. From Lennon's evocative word/sound pictures (the trippy &quot;Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,&quot; the carnival-like &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite&quot;) and McCartney's music hall-styled &quot;When I'm 64,&quot; to Harrison's Eastern-leaning &quot;Within You Without You,&quot; and the avant-garde mini-suite, &quot;A Day in the Life,&quot; Sgt. Pepper was a\nmilestone for both '60s music and popular culture. --Billy Altman\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Sgt. peppers lonely hearts club band                 [02:03]\n02.With A little help from my friends                   [02:44]\n03.Lucy in the sky with diamonds                        [03:29]\n04.Getting better                                       [02:48]\n05.Fixing A hole                                        [02:37]\n06.She's leaving home                                   [03:35]\n07.Being for the benefit of mr kite                     [02:38]\n08.Within you without you                               [05:05]\n09.When i'm sixty four                                  [02:38]\n10.Lovely rita                                          [02:42]\n11.Good morning good morning                            [02:41]\n12.Sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band (reprise)      [01:19]\n13.A day in the life                                    [05:37]\n____\n\n39:56 min\n 59,0 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
