Conventional science claims this is impossible, yet generations of inventors have been mesmerised by the promise of an engine that powers itself. The world's reliance on diminishing fossil fuel resources and the associated problems of pollution serve to spur them on. A Machine to Die For showcases a number of dedicated, sometimes eccentric, and always obsessive individuals who have devoted their lives to this quest.\nThe documentary could be used as a resource when studying motion and simple machines in secondary science and physics. It could also serve as a springboard for discussions about inventors and inventions and the history of scientific endeavours. It would be suitable for teachers of middle to senior secondary students in Science (Physical Sciences), History and Materials Technology. \n\n===============================================================================\n\nTechnical Specs\n  \n\nVideo Codec: XviD MPEG-4 codec\nVideo Bitrate: 1723 KB/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 400\nAudio Codec: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3)\nAudio BitRate: 160 KB/s (CBR)\nAudio Channels: 2 Ch\nRunTime: 00:55\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 744 MB\nEncoded by: gavin63\nSubtitles: No TV Cap\nSource: DVB \n\n\n===============================================================================\n\n\n\nPLEASE, SEED AS LONG AS YOU CAN!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:196fa0a60c1cea16ce30d7e53972d94e90903df0","amp;dn":"ABC+A+Machine+to+Die+For+The+Quest+for+Free+Energy+DVB+Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"196fa0a60c1cea16ce30d7e53972d94e90903df0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,111,160,166,12,28,234,22,206,48,215,229,57,114,217,78,144,144,61,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
