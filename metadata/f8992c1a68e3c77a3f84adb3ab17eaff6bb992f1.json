The lands of Light are prosperous and rich, an Enclave of truth and order, surrounded by the twisted and barren lands of the dark, war-ravaged plains known as the Outlands. \n\nOver the centuries the rift has started to close, skirmishes along the border have become more and more frequent and it is only a matter of time before these altercations turn into a full scale war. \n\nHere, it is up to you to choose. Will you lead the desperate people of Celenheim and save them from destruction, or will you ally with the dark hordes of the Outlands and overrun the Enclave to get back what you claim to be yours? Make your decision and experience incredibly atmospheric and intense medieval combat action!\n\n\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.\n\nWAITING ON THE REQUEST LIST TO BE UPLOADED:\n\nFAR CRY\nFAR CRY 2: FORTUNE'S EDITION\nMEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT WAR CHEST\t\nGOTHIC 1, 2, 3\nIN COLD BLOOD\n\n--------------\nREQUESTS THAT I CAN'T FULFILL AT THE MOMENT\n\nLeisure Suit Larry Language Pack\nDon't Starve\nKing of Dragon Pass\nGalactic Civilizations I Ultimate Edition\nThe Cat Lady\nJourneyman Project 3\n\n--------------\n\nIF POSSIBLE, DON'T FORGET TO SUPPORT THE COMPANIES AND GOG.COM FOR THEIR GREAT SERVICE.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8992c1a68e3c77a3f84adb3ab17eaff6bb992f1","amp;dn":"Enclave+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8992c1a68e3c77a3f84adb3ab17eaff6bb992f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,153,44,26,104,227,199,122,63,132,173,179,171,23,234,255,107,185,146,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
