The most prestigious architects from across the globe have buildings in various phases of completion all over town. As chairman of the Gotham Landmarks Commission, Bruce Wayne has been a key part of this boom, which signals a golden age of architectural ingenuity for the city. And then, the explosions begin. All manner of design related malfunctions faulty crane calculations, sturdy materials suddently collapsing, software glitches, walkways giving way and much moreÃ¢â‚¬â€œcause casualties across the city. This bizarre string of seemingly random, unconnected catastrophes threaten to bring the whole construction industry down. Fingers are pointed as Batman must somehow solve the problem and find whoever is behind it all.\n\n*** Enjoy and Please SEED ***\n\n\nThere are way too many great uploaders to list anymore :) Search TPB Comics and you'll find almost anything you want.
