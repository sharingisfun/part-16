Van Wageningen had to drop out because he had been unable to secure a working permit when filming began. \n\nThe &quot;PreCogs&quot; were all named after famous mystery writers. Dashiell Hammett, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Agatha Christie. \n\nMeryl Streep was originally cast as Iris Hineman, but had to back out. \n\nThe film was almost shot a few years earlier, before Steven Spielberg decided to do A.I. Artificial Intelligence instead and have the &quot;Minority Report&quot; script reworked. According to reports, Tom Cruise's co-stars in that version would have been Cate Blanchett as Agatha, Matt Damon as Witwer, Ian McKellen as Burgess and Jenna Elfman as Lara Anderton. After the delay, Javier Bardem has stated in interviews that he was offered the part of Witwer, but turned it down because he &quot;didn't want to just run around chasing Tom Cruise&quot;. This led to the casting of Colin Farrell. \n\n\n\n\n\ntorrent name\n\n\nMinority Report 2002 720p BRrip_sujaidr\n\n\n\nvideo details\n\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4b03222c230b07786579&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 7 frames\nCodec ID                         : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                         : 2h 25mn\nNominal bit rate                 : 828 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                           : 536 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.40:1\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.050\n\n\n\n\naudio details\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                   : HE-AAC / LC\nCodec ID                         : A_AAC\nDuration                         : 2h 25mn\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz / 24.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\n\n\n\n\n\nlanguage                         english\n\nsubs                             english\n\n\n\nSAMPLE                  :included\n\nthanks to sun\n\nuploader\n sujaidr\n\n\n\n\nPLOT:In the year 2054 A.D. crime is virtually eliminated from Washington D.C. thanks to an elite law enforcing squad &quot;Precrime&quot;. They use three gifted humans (called &quot;Pre-Cogs&quot;) with special powers to see into the future and predict crimes beforehand. John Anderton heads Precrime and believes the system's flawlessness steadfastly. However one day the Pre-Cogs predict that Anderton will commit a murder himself in the next 36 hours. Worse, Anderton doesn't even know the victim. He decides to get to the mystery's core by finding out the 'minority report' which means the prediction of the female Pre-Cog Agatha that &quot;might&quot; tell a different story and prove Anderton innocent.\n\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\n\nStars:          Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell and Samantha Morton\nimdb:   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nscreenshots\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/37tmv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/37tmv.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/evEt3.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/evEt3.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/DZpTs.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/DZpTs.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/qwtMH.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/qwtMH.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n               RECOMMENDED PLAYER TO VIEW THE MOVIES ARE KM PLAYER(i use this)  OR  VLC PLAYER\n\n                \n          MY COMPUTER IS RUNNING NON STOP TO PROVIDE THESE MOVIES SO A SIMPLE THANKS WOULD BE ENOUGH.ITS REALLY SAD THAT MANY DOWNLOAD BUT DONT EVEN RATE OR COMMENT\n\n            DONT HIT AND RUN,SEED BACK.LET OTHERS ENJOY TOO AND YOU ARE GETTING THIS FOR FREE SO ATLEAST SEED BACK    \n\n                                      \n\n\n                       SEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.SHARING IS CARING\n\n                       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED \n\n                         DO COMMENT ON THE QUALITY,IT WONT TAKE MUCH OF YOUR TIME  \n                               CHECK OUT MY OTHER TORRENTS \n\n                                                   \n                                             \n\n         to visit my facebook page for requests GOOGLE SUJAIDR\n\nNOTE:due to frequent power cuts,seeding might be interrupted so patience guys and remember to rate,comment,seed AFTER DOWNLOAD and enjoy.\n\nREQUESTS ARE WELCOME AND WILL DO IT WHEN POSSIBLE\n\nafter repeated requests,still there is a lot of hit and run on my torrents.therefore download my movies while i am seeding,get it before the torrent dies\n\n\n\nTORRENT STAts &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/99ca/108d88d2c.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/99ca/108d88d2c.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPRESS THE +1 TO RATE MY TORRENT AS THERE ARE MORONS WHO INTENTIONALLY NEGATIVE RATE MY TORRENTS SO PLEASE SUPPORT ME BY RATIN UP\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04e8bf8c811681dfe26899cace2e292907400229","amp;dn":"Minority+Report+2002+720p+BRrip_sujaidr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04e8bf8c811681dfe26899cace2e292907400229","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,232,191,140,129,22,129,223,226,104,153,202,206,46,41,41,7,64,2,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
