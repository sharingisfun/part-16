The songs were inspired by a series of semi-autobiographical stories of growing up in suburbia only to enroll in the school of hard knocks and come out a fighter; it's simultaneously cynical and reverent. The band that backs Prophet's fiery guitar work is a roots rock unit tightened up from ceaseless European touring, and this live-in-the-studio recording suits their take-no-prisoners delivery. This record ought to bring Prophet some well-deserved kudos.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a3d02beb3f7ba2e217cc18efd83f8bae8721225","amp;dn":"Chuck+Prophet+-+Homemade+Blood+%5B1997%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a3d02beb3f7ba2e217cc18efd83f8bae8721225","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,61,2,190,179,247,186,46,33,124,193,142,253,131,248,186,232,114,18,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
