His style has been greatly influential and has been described as the foundation of American Primitivism, a term borrowed from painting and referring mainly to the self-taught nature of the music and its minimalist style. Fahey borrowed from the folk and blues traditions in American roots music, having compiled many forgotten early recordings in these genres. He would later incorporate classical, Portuguese, Brazilian, and Indian music into his Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“uvre. Fahey wrote a largely apocryphal autobiography and was known for his coarseness, aloof demeanor, and dry humour. He spent many of his latter years in poverty and poor health, but also enjoyed a minor career resurgence with a turn towards the more explicitly avant-garde. He died in 2001 due to complications from heart surgery. In 2003, he was ranked 35th in the Rolling Stone &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; list.\n\n\nTracklist:  \n1.\tBeautiful Linda Getchell  [1:50] (Fahey-Smith) \n2.\tOrinda-Moraga [3:55] \n3.\tI Am The Resurrection [2:53] \n4.\tOn The Sunny Side Of The Ocean [3:13] \n5.\tTell Her To Come Back Home [2:40] \n6.\tMy Station Will Be Changed After While [2:02] \n7.\t101 Is A Hard Road To Travel [2:17]  \n8.\tHow Green Was My Valley [2:15] \n9.\tBicycle Built For Two  [1:10]  \n10.\tThe Death Of The Clayton Peacock  [2:52] \n11.\tBrenda's Blues  [1:45] \n12.\tOld Southern Medley  [6:08] \n13.\tCome Back Baby  [2:20]  \n14.\tPoor Boy  [2:25]  \n15.\tSaint Patrick's Hymn  [0:55]\n\n\nPersonnel:\nJohn Fahey ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\nL.
