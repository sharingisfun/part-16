In this short project course, author Kacie Hultgren takes us through the four steps needed to design and ultimately print a replacement part with your 3D printer: sketching your ideas on paper, translating notes into a digital design with a CAD program, testing the print, and then revising and improving on your model. Start now and learn to create replacement parts that are almost as good as the original.\nTopics include:\n\n    Measuring with calipers\n    Modeling in 3D with Tinkercad\n    Creating holes and complex shapes\n    Plating and printing\n    Optimizing and reworking the design\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc9ba191425e6ff08d5c87519234eb3e78036d33","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+3D+Printing+Project_Designing+replacement+part","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc9ba191425e6ff08d5c87519234eb3e78036d33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,155,161,145,66,94,111,240,141,92,135,81,146,52,235,62,120,3,109,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
