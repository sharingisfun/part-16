Bad weather, rocks and icebergs, equipment failures, human error, and many more types of tragedies have all sent ships to watery graves. While modern technology has made sea-going vessels safer and rescues easier, there still are terrible disasters that occur. With dramatic images and eyewitness accounts--plus the latest facts and figures--this book gives you a close-up look at disasters at sea.
