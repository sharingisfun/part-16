Luke traps an eel with local fisherman Bruno before cooking up one of his signature dishes on Bruno's handmade houseboat. He spends his last night in the Loire cooking a rustic roast duck dish by an open fireplace. Heading to St Malo, a town of pirates and seafood delights, Luke catches giant crabs with local fisherman Gill. Tamarind is the ingredient that makes the crab dish so delicious. Over the provincial border in Normandy, where Mont Saint-Michel looms large, Luke shares his knowledge of salt marsh lambs. Back in Saint Malo he meets with larger-than-life character Jean Yves, a third generation butter specialist, and cooks a delicious scallop dish. Looking back at his wonderful experiences travelling through France, Luke muses: &quot;If there is a more beautiful place on earth, I can't wait to see it!&quot;\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 24-Jul-2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53e3770567a2fae915e6230ece0b460f65e34cf7","amp;dn":"Luke.Nguyens.France.S01E10.DVDRip.x264-W4F.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53e3770567a2fae915e6230ece0b460f65e34cf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,227,119,5,103,162,250,233,21,230,35,14,206,11,70,15,101,227,76,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
