On the next day, 17 years earlier, the first U.S. Satellite passed through the Van Allen radiation belt. On March 17, the airplane &quot;black box&quot; made its maiden voyage (1953). And what about today? Every day of the year has a rich scientific and technological heritage just waiting to be uncovered, and Wired's top-flight science-trivia book MAD SCIENCE collects them chronologically, from New Year's Day to year's end, showing just how entertaining, wonderful, bizarre, and relevant science can be.\n\nIn 2010, Wired's popular &quot;This Day in Tech&quot; blog peaked with more than 700,000 page views each month, and one story in 2008 drew more than a million unique viewers. This book will collect the most intriguing anecdotes from the blog's run-one for each day of the year-and publish them in a package that will instantly appeal to hardcore techies and curious laypeople alike.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ceaaa621511de98411894b2804a08a9b9b29cbc2","amp;dn":"Mad+Science+-+Einstein%27s+Fridge%2C+Dewar%27s+Flask%2C+Mach%27s+Speed%2C+an","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ceaaa621511de98411894b2804a08a9b9b29cbc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,170,166,33,81,29,233,132,17,137,75,40,4,160,138,155,155,41,203,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
