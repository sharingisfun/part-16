The authors adopt a method of close textual and ethnographic reading, which results in some surprisingly new and subtle ways of interpreting older, more &quot;classical&quot; discourses, such as Veda and Mimamsa, as well as newer discourses, such as the RSS use of the Devimahatmya.\r\n\r\nHardcover: 256 pages\r\nPublisher: Oxford University Press; 1 edition (January 31, 2002)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 0195134788\r\nISBN-13: 978-0195134780","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c350fce2b2ee906f7113e4d561da52ed6541b53","amp;dn":"Jewels+of+Authority%3A+Women+and+Textual+Tradition+in+Hindu+India+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c350fce2b2ee906f7113e4d561da52ed6541b53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,53,15,206,43,46,233,6,247,17,62,77,86,29,165,46,214,84,27,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
