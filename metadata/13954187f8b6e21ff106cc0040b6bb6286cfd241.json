He has recorded an immense volume of work, his 29th album being released in summer 2006, and has written songs in styles ranging from folk to jazz-influenced rock to rock and roll.\n\nCockburn was born in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada and spent some of his early years on a farm outside Pembroke, Ontario. He has stated in interviews that his first guitar was one he found in his grandmother's attic, which he then adorned with golden stars and used to play along to radio hits[2]; another source places this momentous event as happening in 1959. Cockburn was a student (but did not study music) at Nepean High School, where his 1964 yearbook photo states his desire simply: &quot;hopes to become a musician.&quot;[3] He then attended Berklee College of Music in Boston for three semesters in the mid-1960s: &quot;I got a lot out of it, but it didn't feel right to continue there.&quot; In 1966 he was asked to join an Ottawa band called The Children, which lasted for about a year. In the spring of 1967, he joined the final lineup of the Esquires before moving to Toronto in the summer to form The Flying Circus with former Bobby Kris &amp; The Imperials members Marty Fisher and Gordon MacBain and ex-Tripp member Neil Lillie. The group recorded some material in late 1967 (which remains unreleased) before changing its name to Olivus in the spring of 1968, by which point Lillie (who changed his name to Neil Merryweather) had been replaced by Dennis Pendrith from Livingstone's Journey. Olivus opened for The Jimi Hendrix Experience and Cream in April 1968. That summer Cockburn broke up Olivus, intending to go solo but ending up in the band 3's a Crowd with David Wiffen, Colleen Peterson and Richard Patterson, who had played with him in The Children. Cockburn left this band in the spring of 1969 to pursue a solo career.\n\nHe had made his first solo appearance at the Mariposa Folk Festival in 1967, and was the headliner when Neil Young cancelled in order to appear at Woodstock in 1969. In 1970 he released his first, self-titled, solo album. Cockburn's phenomenal guitar work and songwriting skills won him an enthusiastic following. His early work sparkles with rural and nautical imagery, Biblical metaphors, and a sense of delight in the belief that whatever happens here on earth, heaven is not far away. Raised as an agnostic, early in his career he became a devout Christian.[4] Many of his albums from the 1970s refer to his Christian belief, which in turn informs the concerns for human rights and environmentalism expressed on his 1980s albums. His references to Christianity in his music include the Grail imagery of 20th-century Christian poet Charles Williams and the ideas of theologian Harvey Cox,[5] but they are so subtle and musical that they do not exclude nonbelievers.\n\nWhile Cockburn had been popular in Canada for years, he did not make a splash in the United States until 1979, with the release of the album Dancing in the Dragon's Jaws, still a landmark of acoustic-based pop featuring intricate lyrics, great sonics, and startling guitar work. Wondering Where the Lions Are, the first single from that album, reached #21 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US in June 1980, and earned Cockburn an appearance on NBC's hit TV show Saturday Night Live.  \n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1 My Beat\n2 Wondering Where The Lions Are\n3 Tokyo\n4 The Coldest Night of the Year\n5 The Trouble With Normal\n6 Lovers in a Dangerous Time\n7 If I Had A Rocket Launcher\n8 Call It Democracy\n9 Waiting For A Miracle\n10 If A Tree Falls\n11 A Dream Like Mine\n12 Listen for the Laugh\n13 Night Train\n14 Pacing the Cage\n15 Last Night of the World\n16 Anything Anytime Anywhere\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13954187f8b6e21ff106cc0040b6bb6286cfd241","amp;dn":"Bruce+Cockburn+-+Greatest+Hits+1979+-+2002+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13954187f8b6e21ff106cc0040b6bb6286cfd241","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,149,65,135,248,182,226,31,241,6,204,0,64,182,187,98,134,207,210,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
