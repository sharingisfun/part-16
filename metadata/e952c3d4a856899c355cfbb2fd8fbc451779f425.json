In her job as courier, Aisling is to deliver a precious demonic artifact to a Mme. Deauxville in Paris, but she finds Madame freshly dead, surrounded by a circle of ash. The artifact is then stolen by the fast-talking Drake, who claims that Aisling is no mere courier but in fact a demon lord and his destined mate. Determined to play detective, Aisling summons up a demon only to find herself saddled with one, in the form of a slobbering Newfoundland who wants to go walkies. Drake wants to show her the way dragons mate, and then bodies seem to pile up all over Paris, making Aisling a corpse magnet and top suspect. It's going to take every screwy new ally she's got to solve this murder and adjust to her new life in a strange new world.\n\nUSA Today best-selling author Katie MacAlister's novels have been called &quot;wickedly witty&quot; and &quot;deliciously sexy&quot; by Booklist. You Slay Me is a lusty romance novel with amusing supernatural undercurrents. When courier Aisling Grey is dispatched to Paris to deliver a priceless dragon statue to a rich and eccentric female collector, she finds the intended recipient the apparent victim of a demonic ritual. And that's just the beginning of Aisling's discoveries.\n\nAudio CD\nPublisher: Recorded Books (2005)\nISBN-10: 1419334956\nISBN-13: 978-1419334955\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
