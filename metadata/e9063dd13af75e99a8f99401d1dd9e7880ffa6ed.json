It is Christmas, and Daniel Sempere and his wife Bea have much to celebrate. They have a beautiful new baby son named Julian, and their close friend FermÃƒÂ­n Romero de Torres is about to be wed. But their joy is eclipsed when a mysterious stranger visits the Sempere bookshop and threatens to divulge a terrible secret that has been buried for two decades in the city's dark past. His appearance plunges FermÃƒÂ­n and Daniel into a dangerous adventure that will take them back to the 1940's and the dark early days of Franco's dictatorship. The terrifying events of that time launch them on a journey fraught with jealousy, suspicion, vengeance, and lies, a search for the truth that will put into peril everything they love and ultimately transform their lives.\n\nFull of intrigue and emotion, The Prisoner of Heaven is a majestic novel in which the threads of The Shadow of the Wind and The Angel's Game converge under the spell of literature and bring us toward the enigma of the mystery hidden at the heart of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a collection of lost treasures known only to its few initiates and the very core of Carlos Ruiz ZafÃƒÂ³n's enchanting fictional world.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Gabriel GarcÃƒï¿½a Marquez meets Umberto Eco meets Jorge Luis Borges for a sprawling magic show.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€New York Times Book Review on Shadow of the Wind.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9063dd13af75e99a8f99401d1dd9e7880ffa6ed","amp;dn":"The+Prisoner+of+Heaven+-+Carlos+Ruiz+Zaf%26oacute%3Bn.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9063dd13af75e99a8f99401d1dd9e7880ffa6ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,6,61,209,58,247,94,153,168,249,148,1,209,221,158,120,128,255,166,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
