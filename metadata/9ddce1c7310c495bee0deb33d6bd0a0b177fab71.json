The first trial\nopened on September 5, 1978. It stopped on September 18, 1978 when\nit was discovered that one of the jurymen was a serving SAS officer!\n\nThe second trial commenced on October 3, 1978. Section 1 charges\nwere dropped on October 24, 1978. Defendants were found guilty under\nSection 2 and received non custodial sentences, November 17, 1978.\n\nThe trial led to changes in the OSA. Public interest to know would\nno longer be a defence. Nor would the fact that the 'secret' revealed\nwas not a secret (GCHQ, which grew out of Bletchley Park, was openly\ntalked about in the UK, &amp; was certainly known to, say, the Eastern Bloc). &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cryptome.quintessenz.at/mirror/justice-dc.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cryptome.quintessenz.at/mirror/justice-dc.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ddce1c7310c495bee0deb33d6bd0a0b177fab71","amp;dn":"BBC+R4+Documentary+-+%5C%27The+ABC+Trial%5C%27+sp7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ddce1c7310c495bee0deb33d6bd0a0b177fab71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,220,225,199,49,12,73,91,238,13,235,51,214,189,10,11,23,127,171,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
