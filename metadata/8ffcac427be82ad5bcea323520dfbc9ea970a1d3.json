One of the most remote places on earth, the Hawaiian Islands were thrust into the spotlight of history by Pearl Harbor, and the Pacific archipelago became America's 50th state in 1959. From the voyages of the ancient Polynesians to the current independence movement, this feature-length special examines America's tropical treasures. Meet some of the many larger-than-life figures who have called Hawaii home and examine the influence of people like Captain Cook and the legendary king Kamehameha, who used courage, luck, determination, deceit and strategic brilliance to bind the islands into one nation. Head to the Pacific for a tour of the real Hawaii, and see what the islands were like before the hotels came to Honolulu. \n\nFile Size ------- 696mb\nLength ---------- 1:30:44\nResolution ------ 496x300\nContainer ------- avi\nVideo Codec ----- h264\nAudio Codec ----- mp3\nFrame Rate ------ 24\n\nTracked and seeded by http://tracker.thehashden.com/announce","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ffcac427be82ad5bcea323520dfbc9ea970a1d3","amp;dn":"History+Channel%3A+Conquest+of+Hawaii","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ffcac427be82ad5bcea323520dfbc9ea970a1d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,252,172,66,123,232,42,213,188,234,50,53,32,223,188,158,169,112,161,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
