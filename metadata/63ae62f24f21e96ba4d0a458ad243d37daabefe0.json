Works by Olivier Messiaen and Marco Stroppa attest to the vitality of Liszt's imagination to the present day.\n\nLiszt's seminal B minor Sonata is contrasted with other one-movement sonatas by Berg, Wagner and Scriabin (his startling Black Mass). Shorter pieces by Liszt point to their correspondence with works by BartÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³k and Ravel.\n\nRecorded live in Vienna's Konzerthaus over two evenings, Pierre-Laurent Aimard's Liszt project is a pinnacle of the Liszt Year commemorations.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63ae62f24f21e96ba4d0a458ad243d37daabefe0","amp;dn":"The+Liszt+Project++-++Pierre-Laurent+Aimard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63ae62f24f21e96ba4d0a458ad243d37daabefe0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,174,98,242,79,33,233,107,164,208,164,88,173,36,61,55,218,171,239,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
