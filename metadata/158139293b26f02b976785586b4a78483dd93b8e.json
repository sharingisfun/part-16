It includes songs about Abraham and Christ's Transfiguration, among many others. The album is softer and sparser than other albums by Stevens, relying more heavily on his trademark banjo and melodious voice.\n\nSeven Swans was received well by critics. The Guardian called it &quot;a record of remarkable delicacy&quot; and Spin magazine said it sounded &quot;like Elliott Smith after ten years of Sunday school&quot;.\n\nThe album was released on compact disc and vinyl LP; the vinyl was released by Burnt Toast Vinyl.\n\n&quot;All the Trees of the Field Will Clap Their Hands&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14 \n&quot;The Dress Looks Nice on You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:32 \n&quot;In the Devil's Territory&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:57 \n&quot;To Be Alone with You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:44 \n&quot;Abraham&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:33 \n&quot;Sister&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:00 \n&quot;Size Too Small&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:04 \n&quot;We Won't Need Legs to Stand&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:12 \n&quot;A Good Man Is Hard to Find&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:16 \n&quot;He Woke Me Up Again&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:43 \n&quot;Seven Swans&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:33 \n&quot;The Transfiguration&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:18 \n\nReleased March 16, 2004 \nGenre Folk rock, Indie folk \nLength 46:19 \nLanguage English \nLabel Sounds Familyre \nProducer Daniel Smith \n\nPLEASE SEED\n\nripped by dBpoweramp\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:158139293b26f02b976785586b4a78483dd93b8e","amp;dn":"Sufjan+Stevens...Seven+Swans%282004%29%5BFLAC%5D---DICKTHESPIC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"158139293b26f02b976785586b4a78483dd93b8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,129,57,41,59,38,240,43,151,103,133,88,107,74,120,72,61,217,59,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
