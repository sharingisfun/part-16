It involves extended and detailed financial analysis of various asset class returns and proposes a five-asset class approach for future use.\n\nOpening with a study of the historic asset allocation practice of UK pension funds, the book shows how the current approach has led to the present funding crisis. It goes on to compare and contrast the UK approach with that of the US and to propose a new approach to UK asset allocation: the five asset class approach (&quot;MAC InvestingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½).\n\nThe book reviews and analyses different asset classes based on historic returns, examines risk, and concludes with a suggestion of the five asset classes to use; Quoted equities (both Domestic and foreign), hedge funds, private equity and property. This book also includes benchmark performance figures never previously published.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 320 pages\n    * Publisher: Wiley; 1 edition (August 7, 2006)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0470027991\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0470027998","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7df8ea5c10c6bc0f63f9ef31ebe810c632931b8","amp;dn":"Multi+Asset+Class+Investment+Strategy+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7df8ea5c10c6bc0f63f9ef31ebe810c632931b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,223,142,165,193,12,107,192,246,63,158,243,30,190,129,12,99,41,49,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
