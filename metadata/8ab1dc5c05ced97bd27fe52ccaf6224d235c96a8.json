The mobsters are willing to give him an alternative in settling his debt by doing a job, the killing of a Chinese bookie. Though it may sound like your average gangster flick, The Killing of a Chinese Bookie is certainly not. Cassavetes as usual focuses heavily on character and disregards the story to the point that it never really finishes, at the end Cosmo's fate remains a mystery. By ignoring the genre's necessity of a rigidly structured story Cassavetes clearly points out that this isn't a crime film but a film about the man behind the criminal whose own compulsions will eventually drive him to his destruction. Cassavetes's regular Ben Gazzara is at great shape and gives an amazing performance.\n\n\nwww.freakyflicks.tk\n\nSEED AS LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE!\n\n'If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, this torrent will NEVER DIE'\n\n... simply search for 'freakyflicks' \n*************************************** \n************** FREAKYFLICKS ************* \n***************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ab1dc5c05ced97bd27fe52ccaf6224d235c96a8","amp;dn":"John+Cassavetes+-+The+Killing+of+a+Chinese+Bookie+%281976%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ab1dc5c05ced97bd27fe52ccaf6224d235c96a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,177,220,92,5,206,217,123,210,127,229,44,202,246,34,77,35,92,150,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
