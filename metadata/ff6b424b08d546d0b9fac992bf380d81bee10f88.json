It was an international hit, the first and most successful single from their album Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too. It reached No. 30 on Billboard Hot 100 Airplay in January 1999, No. 36 on the overall Hot 100. It also reached #8 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. It was a bigger hit in the UK and Canada, reaching No. 5 in the UK and #1 on Canada's Singles Chart. The song is an upbeat youth anthem, based around a chord progression of A/D to G/C, over a steady drumbeat. Many were drawn to the song's optimistic attitude and feel-good atmosphere (the song itself is about remaining true to who you are and not being &quot;a fake&quot;), making it one of the mainstay singles of the late 1990s. It has been played over one million times on U.S. radio.\n\nThe B-side was &quot;To Think I Thought&quot;, a rock song with lyrics that may be ad-libbed.\n\nThe music video for &quot;You Get What You Give&quot; was filmed in the Staten Island Mall, New York and directed by Evan Bernard. New Radicals' front man Gregg Alexander said he chose this setting because he sees the shopping mall as a metaphor for society - a fake, controlled environment engineered to encourage spending. The video showed a group of teenagers led by Alexander, going through the mall wreaking havocÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½tossing nets on security guards, placing businessmen in animal cages, knocking over merchandise, hijacking Lambrettas, and moshing in the foodcourt.\n\nVH1 voted it as the 64th greatest one-hit wonder in 2002.\n\nIn 2007, the song was voted #90 on VH1's &quot;100 Greatest Songs of the 90&quot;, and in 2010 it was number 106 on Pitchfork Media's Top 200 Tracks of the 90s.\n\nIn a Time Magazine interview, U2 lead guitarist The Edge is quoted saying &quot;You Get What You Give&quot; is the song he is most &quot;jealous of.&quot; &quot;I really would love to have written that,&quot; he stated.\n\nThe song was listed #440 on Blender's list of The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born.\n\nThe song is an unofficial Newcastle United anthem and is regularly played at their home ground St James' Park. The song was used by local radio station Metro Radio during Newcastle's FA cup-run of 1998-99, with Mick Lowes' commentary of Newcastle's cup goals mixed over the song.\n\nIn the liner notes to her 2004 compilation Artist's Choice, Joni Mitchell praises &quot;You Get What You Give&quot; for &quot;rising from the swamp of 'McMusic' like a flower of hope.&quot; Michelle Branch, Lulu, The Okay Feeling, and Martin Fry have covered this song live in concert. It was also performed by the Final 13 of Australian Idol 2005 &amp; 2006. Both times the controversial &quot;Health insurance...&quot; section was omitted.\n\nLMC released a remix of this song sampling the original Alexander vocals as &quot;LMC vs. New Radicals&quot; in 2005, under the title &quot;Don't Let Go&quot;. Another remix entitled &quot;You Get What You Give&quot; was released in 2006, this time with a re-recorded vocal performance by Rachel McFarlane. &quot;You Get What You Give&quot; charted at #30 in the UK.\n\nIn 2006, Ice-T was asked on Late Night with Conan O'Brien about what he has heard, besides rap music, of late in the last few years that really grabbed him and his only reply was &quot;You Get What You Give.&quot;\n\nIn 2010, Stephen Strasburg was quoted as saying this song really inspired him to become the pitcher he has become. The simplicity of the thought, &quot;You Get What You Give,&quot; is easy to grasp and use in your day to day life.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff6b424b08d546d0b9fac992bf380d81bee10f88","amp;dn":"New+Radicals+-+You+Get+What+You+Give+%28Xvid-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff6b424b08d546d0b9fac992bf380d81bee10f88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,107,66,75,8,213,70,208,185,250,201,146,191,56,13,129,190,225,15,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
