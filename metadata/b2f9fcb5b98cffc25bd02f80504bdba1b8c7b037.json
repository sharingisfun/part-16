In David's hands, the Egyptian builders of the pyramids are revealed as simple people, leading ordinary lives while they are engaged in building the great tomb for a Pharaoh. They worry about their families, grumble about the quality of the food, cheat overseers, even plan a strike for better conditions. Gone are the whip-driven slaves of the popular image: in their place are skilled workers knowing the value of their labor.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2f9fcb5b98cffc25bd02f80504bdba1b8c7b037","amp;dn":"The+Pyramid+Builders+of+Ancient+Egypt+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2f9fcb5b98cffc25bd02f80504bdba1b8c7b037","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,249,252,181,185,140,255,194,91,208,47,128,80,75,219,161,184,199,176,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
