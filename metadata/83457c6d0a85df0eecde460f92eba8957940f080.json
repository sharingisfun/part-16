A land of Forest Lords, of Shadow Princes and Coastal Kings. A place that is both civilized and savage. Where the social classes know their place, but where anyone can, under the right conditions, advance to the highest pinnacle. This is a place where pleasure is not censured but encouraged; where the ends are justified by the means. And yet all is not as perfect as it may seem. The orderly, elegant veneer of refined Hetar cannot prevent the rebellion brewing in the Outlands, a dangerous place of both magic and mystery.\n\nFrom the City that is the very center of Hetar, Lara, the beautiful half-faerie daughter of John Swiftsword, ventures forth on a journey that will take her into the heart of darkness and the depths of desire, as she learns the true meaning of love that will last an eternity -- a love that will change the destiny of Hetar forever.\n\nCreating Hetar and its many characters has been a great challenge for me, but a wonderful and creative endeavor. I hope you will enjoy Lara's tale.\n\nA Distant Tomorrow - World of Hetar (2)\n\nFive years have now passed since the Winter War between the Outlands and Hetar. But Gaius Prospero has not given up his scheme to become emperor, and unexpected tragedy causes Lara to once again heed the pull of her destiny. Finding herself across the sea in a secret new world known as Terah, she discovers that her magical abilities grow greater with each passing day.\n\nUsing her newfound powers, Lara lifts an ancient curse from the men of Terah, earning its ruler's gratitude -- and his deep and passionate love. Magnus Hauk has never known a woman like Lara, and his fascination leads him to venture back across the sea with her to prevent another war. There, however, the ruler of Terah learns that betrayal is an everyday commodity; nothing is exactly what is seems in beautiful, sinister Hetar. And the lovers attract the animosity of Prospero, a dangerous enemy to have. For power, dear reader, does corrupt absolutely.\n\nThis tale continues to unfold within the corridors of my imagination. I hope you will enjoy Lara's further adventures as she continues to seek out her true destiny. I know I am enjoying writing it for you.\n\nThe Twilight Lord - World of Hetar (3)\n\nLara, Domina of Terah, has mysteriously disappeared while visiting the New Outlands. The Dominus is frantic to find his beloved wife, but when no trace of her can be discovered, Magnus Hauk turns to two strong alliesÃ¢â‚¬â€Prince Kaliq of the Shadows and his mother-in-law, Ilona, the most powerful of the faerie queens. Who has stolen Lara? And why?\n\nIn the Dark Lands, Kol, the Twilight Lord, revels in his victory. The faerie woman Lara is now his possession, and her powers will soon help him to conquer first Hetar and then Terah. But the Emperor of Hetar is hatching schemes of his ownÃ¢â‚¬â€having learned of Lara's disappearance he believes Terah is now vulnerable, and plans to go to war against Magnus Hauk.\n\nThe Sorceress of Belmair - World of Hetar (4)\n\nA Past Awakened\nMagic coursing through his blood, Dillon, son of Lara, Domina of Hetar, follows his mystical path to Hetar's brightest star. Belmair is a forgotten world. And, it turns out, his people's lost heritage. Summoned to marry the king's daughter and inherit the throne, Dillon discovers Belmair is beautiful, enigmatic and seductiveÃƒâ€˜as is his strong-willed new queen, and the mystery lying at Belmair's heart.\n\nA Love Unimagined\nCinnia, sorceress of Belmair, expected to claim her rightful place as ruler, not as the wife of a stranger chosen by Belmair's magical guardian.

But standing by her side is Kaliq, the greatest of the Shadow Princes whose undying love for Lara will be her salvation.\n \nCrown of Destiny (World of Hetar #6)\n\nA hundred years have passed since the Faerie woman Lara last saved the world of Hetar from the darkness. Her youth and her beauty remain as always. The passing years, however, have taken many of her friends and kin. Her influence has waned. Those who remember her heroism in times of peril are few. Even her great-grandson, Cadarn, Dominus of Terah, denies her strong magic.And all the while Lara's son, the charming but nefarious Twilight Lord, Kolgrim, waits patiently for his moment.
