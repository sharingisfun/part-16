It is widely considered the preeminent work of Italian literature, and is seen as one of the greatest works of world literature. The poem's imaginative and allegorical vision of the afterlife is a culmination of the medieval world-view as it had developed in the Western Church. It helped establish the Tuscan dialect in which it is written as the standardized Italian. It is divided into three parts, the Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso.\n\nOn the surface the poem describes Dante's travels through Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven; but at a deeper level it represents allegorically the soul's journey towards God. At this deeper level, Dante draws on medieval Christian theology and philosophy, especially the writings of Thomas Aquinas. At the surface level, the poem clearly is a fictional account of Heaven, Purgatory and Hell.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c3676966d7f6a8d90e0734f969659bcc898a812","amp;dn":"The+Divine+Comedy+-+Complete+with+Footnotes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c3676966d7f6a8d90e0734f969659bcc898a812","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,54,118,150,109,127,106,141,144,224,115,79,150,150,89,188,200,152,168,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
