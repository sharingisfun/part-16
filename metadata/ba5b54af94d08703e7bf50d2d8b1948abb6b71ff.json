A quarter of a century later, DeVille continued to blend musical traditions and postmodern intensity. A self-taught guitarist, DeVille found his early inspiration in the blues of John Hammond Jr., Muddy Waters, and John Lee Hooker. Determined to become a musician, he moved to London in 1971, hoping to latch on with a British band. Frustrated by his lack of success, he returned to the United States. Temporarily settling in San Francisco, he spent most of 1972 developing his stage persona in Bay Area clubs. Returning to New York, DeVille was in the right place at the right time. Forming a band, Dilly DeSade &amp; the Marquis, later renamed Mink DeVille, with bassist Ruben Siguenza and drummer T.R. &quot;Manfred&quot; Allen Jr., he found his roots-oriented rock welcome in the city's burgeoning punk scene. When the independent Omfug label included three of their songs on the multi-artist compilation Live at CBGB's, recorded at the influential New York punk club, their punk connection was assured. With Atlantic acquiring national distribution rights to the album, Mink DeVille became one of the country's top punk bands. \n\n\nGenre................: Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Universal Music Catalogue\nIncluded.............: Covers, auCDtect, Log, Cue\n\n\nCD1 - Mink DeVille\n\n01.Spanish Stroll\n02.Mixed Up, Shook Up Girl\n03.Cadillac Walk\n04.Little Girl\n05.Just Your Friends\n06.Guardian Angel\n07.Soul Twist\n08.Mazurka\n09.Savoir Faire\n10.This Must Be The Night\n11.Just To Walk That Little Girl Home.\n12.Heaven Stood Still\n13.Love And Emotion\n14.Maybe Tomorrow\n15.You Better Move On\n16.Demasiado Corazon (Too Much Heart)\n17.Each Word Is A Beat Of My Heart\n18.Stand By Me\n19.Italian Shoes\n20.I Must Be Dreaming\n21.In The Heart Of The City\n\n\n\nCD2 - Willy DeVille\n\n01.Miracle\n02.Storybook Love (With Mark Knopfler)\n03.Assassin Of Love\n04.Hello My Lover\n05.Beating Like A Tom-Tom\n06.Hey Joe\n07.Even While I Sleep\n08.I Call Your Name\n09.Voodoo Charm\n10.Still (I Love You Still)\n11.Gypsy Deck Of Hearts\n12.Across The Borderline\n13.Lay Me Down Easy\n14.The Downing Of The Flamingo\n15.(Don't Want You) Hanging Around My Door\n16.Come A Little Bit Closer\n17.Right There, Right Then\n18.I Remember The First Time\n19.When I Get Home\n\n\n\nCD3 - Rarities\n\n01.Carmelita (Live In Stockholm)\n02.Let It Be Me (Live In Berlin)\n03.You'll Never Know (With Brenda Lee)\n04.Cuentame Un Cuento (Spanglish Version) (Feat.
