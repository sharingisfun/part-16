Perhaps too closely released on the heels of &quot;Tapestry&quot;, &quot;Music&quot; has certainly been overshadowed by that previous trademark, landmark work. \nWith &quot;Music&quot;, King experiments with some new sounds and styles, such as the R &amp; B track &quot;Brother, Brother&quot; which opens the album with a sound reminiscent of the tune &quot;What's Going On?&quot; The title track is a truly uplifting jazz waltz with an incredible sax improvisation as a centerpiece.  \n\nThe simplicity and honesty of &quot;It's Going To Take Some Time&quot; is stunning and certainly surpasses The Carpenter's more orchestrated version of the tune during the same year.  Throughout &quot;Music&quot;, she effectively utilizes a pair of strong female backup vocalists who strengthen King's own delivery of her material and who bring a richness and soulfulness to tunes such as &quot;Growing Away From Me&quot; and the Goffin/King standard &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful. &quot;\n\nIf this album had received as much press and airplay through the years as &quot;Tapestry&quot; did, tunes like &quot;Song of Long Ago&quot; (with background vocals courtesy of James Taylor) and &quot;Carry Your Load&quot; would now be instant classics.  As it is &quot;Sweet Seasons&quot; is the only top-10 single from the album and the only one most people would be likely to recall. \n\nOver all, &quot;Music&quot; does not have the musical cohesiveness of her next two projects &quot;Rhymes &amp; Reasons&quot; and &quot;Fantasy&quot;, but song for song it certainly contains some of the best material she has ever recorded.
