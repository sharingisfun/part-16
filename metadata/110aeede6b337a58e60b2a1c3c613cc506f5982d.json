Born on the muddy outskirts of Sofia, Kapka Kassabova grew up under Communism, got away just as soon as she could, and has loved and hated her homeland in equal measure ever since. In this illuminating and entertaining memoir, Kapka revisits Bulgaria and her own muddled relationship to it, travelling back to the scenes of her childhood, sampling its bizarre tourist sites, uncovering its centuries' old history of bloodshed and blurred borders, and capturing the absurdities and idiosyncrasies of her own and her country's past.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:110aeede6b337a58e60b2a1c3c613cc506f5982d","amp;dn":"Street+Without+a+Name+-+Kapka+Kassabova.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"110aeede6b337a58e60b2a1c3c613cc506f5982d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,10,238,222,107,51,122,88,230,11,42,28,60,97,60,197,6,245,152,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
