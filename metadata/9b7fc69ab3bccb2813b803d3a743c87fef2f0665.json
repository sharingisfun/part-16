Focus is more on the mixed hero worship/contempt of the people that come in contact with him than on the gun action.\n\nIMDB:\nJimmie Ringo is the fastest gun in the west, but he is getting tired of it all and would like to retire. But whereever he goes, there is always some tough kid who wants to try to beat him to the draw. Written by Rob Brown \n\nFull screen, black and white, english only, no subs, dvd rip, excellent quality.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b7fc69ab3bccb2813b803d3a743c87fef2f0665","amp;dn":"The+Gunfighter+%281950%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b7fc69ab3bccb2813b803d3a743c87fef2f0665","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,127,198,154,179,188,203,40,19,184,3,211,167,67,200,127,239,47,6,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
