The authors provide a conceptual framework for striking the tricky balance between increasing levels of detail (LOD) and the need for smooth, flowing animation. This technical reference will be of use to professionals in game development, computer animation, information visualization, and virtual reality fields.&quot; - Design Issues\nFrom the Back Cover\n&quot;I'm really happy with what Luebke et al. have created. It's exactly what I would want to find on the shelf if I needed to implement some LOD techniques in a game.&quot;\n-Mark DeLoura, Sony Computer Entertainment America\n\n&quot;This is the first and only book that provides a comprehensive coverage about level of detail. When you are finished reading it, all you will be able to say is &quot;Wow!&quot;&quot;\n-Dave Eberly, Magic Software, Inc.\n\n&quot;This book will find a choice spot on my bookshelf.&quot;\n-Will Schroeder, Kitware, Inc.\n\n&quot;This fine book...provides both a treatment of the underlying theory and a valuable practical reference for the graphics practitioner.&quot;\n-Dr. Frederick P.
