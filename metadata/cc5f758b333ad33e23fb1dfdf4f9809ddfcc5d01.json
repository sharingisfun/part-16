She also directs for the Globe company and appears in BBC historical dramas as well.  For contrast, Jane LaPoitaire portrayed the queen in the BBC series directed by Jonathan Miller.  It is available elsewhere on the net but the Ambrose series is not in my collection.  The story is familair from film and stage such as that written by Bernard Shaw.\r\n\r\nI encourage that the original dvds be purchased for libraries so that more may enjoy them as I do.  The subtitles are selectable from your media player.\r\n\r\nNotes written  November 8th  2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc5f758b333ad33e23fb1dfdf4f9809ddfcc5d01","amp;dn":"Shakespeare%27s+Globe+on+Screen+Antony+and+Cleopatra+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc5f758b333ad33e23fb1dfdf4f9809ddfcc5d01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,95,117,139,51,58,211,62,35,251,29,253,244,249,128,157,223,204,93,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
