Issued on the Parlophone Records label in the UK and the rest of Europe in June 1990, Reputation was not only Springfield's first studio album in eight years at the time but in fact also the first album to be released in her native country since 1979's Living Without Your Love. After a string of commercially overlooked albums through the late 1970s and early 1980s Reputation finally managed to resurrect Springfield's career and belatedly resulted in her being re-evaluated and recognised by both music critics and the general public as Britain's foremost 'blue-eyed soul' singer. Mainly produced by Pet Shop Boys and Julian Mendelsohn and recorded in the UK over a period of some eighteen months, Reputation became her highest charting and best-selling album in Britain since 1970's From Dusty with Love, peaking at #18 and selling 60.000 copies within two weeks of its release.\n\nIn 1987, Springfield was beginning to look back towards the UK as a source of recording work, due in large part to her collaboration with Pet Shop Boys on their single &quot;What Have I Done To Deserve This?&quot;. Pet Shop Boys had contacted Springfield's manager to ask if Springfield would perform guest vocals on the duet. Being a fan of their work, Springfield accepted the offer and the song became a massive hit all over the world, peaking at #2 in both the UK and the United States, which proved to be the biggest hit of her career in the US. This renewed Springfield's confidence in recording, as well as interest in her work from the general public, and led to another hit single &quot;Nothing Has Been Proved&quot;, also written by Pet Shop Boys with Springfield in mind. The song was written for the movie Scandal, an account of the so called Profumo Affair of 1963, starring Joanne Whalley and John Hurt. &quot;Nothing Has Been Proved&quot; made the Top 20 in Britain, and led to yet another hit single, &quot;In Private&quot;, which peaked at #14 on the British charts. Despite the fact that &quot;In Private&quot; never was commercially released in the US it managed to become a massive dance-floor hit in the States as well, peaking at #14 on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play chart in early 1990. Both singles were included on Reputation, and Pet Shop Boys collaborated with Springfield on half the album's tracks, which made up side B of the original vinyl edition. Side A included tracks produced by the Pet Shop Boys' longtime collaborator Andy Richards, Swing Out Sister producer Paul Staveley O'Duffy and the late Dan Hartman. Three of these titles were also mixed by the Pet Shop Boys' co-producer Julian Mendelsohn. Critics gave Reputation very favorable reviews, saying it was a long overdue return to form for Springfield, and the album spawned two further single releases, the title track &quot;Reputation&quot; and the ballad &quot;Arrested By You&quot;, written by Rupert Hine and Jeanette Obstoj.\n\nThe Reputation album was in late 1990 followed by the video collection Reputation - The Videos, released on VHS in the UK and Europe by EMI's subsidiary Picture Music International, including the promo videos for &quot;Nothing Has Been Proved&quot;, &quot;In Private&quot;, &quot;Reputation&quot;, &quot;Arrested By You&quot;, interviews with Springfield, as well as a fifth animated promo video for the album track &quot;I Want to Stay Here&quot;. Reputation - The Videos remains unreleased on DVD.\n\nThe Reputation album was first released in the US in 1997, then under the title &quot;Reputation and Rarities&quot;.&quot;\n\nAllmusic.com review:\n\n&quot;In 1990, after almost a decade's absence from the new-release lists and an even longer time away from the charts, Dusty Springfield re-emerged with Reputation. A partial collaboration with the Pet Shop Boys, it proved to be her most satisfying record in 15 years and sold better than anything that she'd released since the '60s. The late-'80s synth pop sound melded perfectly with Springfield's still very expressive, powerful, and soulful singing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Dan Hartman handled the producing chores on four of the cuts, Andy Richards on one, and the album has a unified sound, at once airy and dense, soaring and deep. The best cuts, however, are the five produced (and, in all but one case, written) by Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe of the Pet Shop Boys. Much as Robert Fripp may have been put on this earth first and foremost to produce the Roches, Tennant and Lowe's collaborations with Springfield are as satisfying and unified and whole as she ever achieved working with Jerry Wexler, Thom Bell, and Roland Chambers 20 years earlier. She seems to reach that much higher and also that much deeper inside of herself on &quot;In Private&quot; and &quot;Daydreaming&quot; to much subtler effect; those cuts are very much of a piece with her best work on the Dusty in Memphis, A Brand New Me, and Cameo albums, just later links in the same chain, and their effect is to leave the listener breathless and delighted with their sheer beauty as recordings, as well with as her performance.&quot;\n\n\nTRACK LIST:\n \n&quot;Reputation&quot; (original album, 1990)\n===================================\n01.
