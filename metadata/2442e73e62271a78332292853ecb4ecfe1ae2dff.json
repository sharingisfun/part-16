Both albums feature Joyce in a setting that&amp;#039;s spare and stripped-down -- yet still quite grooving, with a sublime mix of acoustic guitar, tight rhythms, and lovely vocals from Joyce herself! The production is amazing -- with a heavenly sound that&amp;#039;s still yet to be duplicated on most of her other albums -- all elements coming together in magical song, dancing with joy, light, and life -- always mindblowing no matter how many times we hear it! These are the albums that everyone&amp;#039;s always talking about -- and their filled with tracks that easily rank with her best work.\n\n\n\n01.
