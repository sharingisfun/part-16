Jacob is not a businessman . . . he is a hired assassin . . . and his job is to neutralize problems deemed unacceptable by the corporation. But Jacob is not like other employees, nor is he like other people. After a catastrophic motorcycle accident leaves him with CotardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s syndromeÃ¢â‚¬â€an actual condition that causes those afflicted to believe they are deadÃ¢â‚¬â€Jacob perceives himself as nothing but a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shell,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with no emotions and no tether to the concept of right and wrong.\nEmily Buchanan is a bright young second-year associate for DBG, and she has disappeared without a trace. Suspecting that Emily has stolen either vast sums of money or valuable information from the company, Ms. Holquist, JacobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s handler at DBG, assigns him the task of tracking down the young woman and neutralizing her. JacobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s condition allows him to carry out assignments with ruthless, logical precision, devoid of guilt, fear, or dishonor. But as his new assignment draws him inside a labyrinthine network of dark dealings, Jacob finds himself up against something he is completely incapable of understanding.\nShifting with riveting precision from New York to London, Paris to New Delhi, Spark is a thriller that delves into the surveillance state we prognosticate today . . . and will live in tomorrow. In the hands of master storyteller John Twelve Hawks, a unique characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s startling transformation comes to life, making Spark a thriller that resonates and satisfies on many levels.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nFile types: ePub, azw3, MOBI, lrf\nPublisher: Doubleday (October 7, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0385538677\nISBN-13: 978-0385538671\nAmazon Link:\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a034099574731882d50a0a0c77888b9daf01f56","amp;dn":"Spark%3A+A+Novel+by+John+Twelve+Hawks+%282014%29+%5BePub+%7C+azw3+%7C+MOBI%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a034099574731882d50a0a0c77888b9daf01f56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,3,64,153,87,71,49,136,45,80,160,160,199,120,136,185,218,240,31,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
