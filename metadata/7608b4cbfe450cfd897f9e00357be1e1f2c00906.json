This is some awesome music from Computer Magic (whom I suggest you buy music from if you enjoy), she really deserves it. Danz is frickin' talented. I actually put a fair amount of time into making this torrent as well. I added album pictures, re-named everything, and more. Some of the songs may start funny or weirdly. But you're getting this for free, you cheapskate :D *no but seriously sorry about that. It's not very common, just a small little bug that happens. Also, this contains ALL of her public content released since her first album. Without further adieu, enjoy Computer Magic's excellent discography.
