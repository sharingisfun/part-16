Features original cover artwork. Comes with a descripton in Japanese. This is hard bop, the album title should be Live At The Keystone Korner, as it's &quot;properly&quot; named, the old jazz joint in San Francisco. All the giants played the Korner in their time. This is a sensational trio session, they burn the place up, the energy level is very high and well sustained throughout...words fail me. Deliciously long tracks.\r\n\r\nAn outstanding veteran pianist from Spain, Tete Montoliu was born blind. He learned to read music in Braille when he was seven and developed impressive technique on piano. He recorded with Lionel Hampton in 1956, had his first session as a leader in 1958, and played with the touring Roland Kirk in 1963. Through the years, he also worked with such visiting Americans as Kenny Dorham, Dexter Gordon, Ben Webster, Lucky Thompson, and even Anthony Braxton. Tete Montoliu's visits to the U.S. were very infrequent, but his SteepleChase albums (starting in 1971) are generally available; he also cut one date for Contemporary (1979) and recorded for Enja and Soul Note.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - Autumn In New York ~ Scrapple From The Apple\r\n02 - I'll Remember April\r\n03 - You've Changed\r\n04 - Lady Bird\r\n\r\n*2015 Timeless Records / Solid Records Japan / Ultra-Vibe | CDSOL-6308 {2015 Japan Timeless Jazz Master Collection Complete Series}\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nTete Montoliu - piano\r\nHerbie Lewis - bass\r\nBilly Higgins - drums\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd1a4fb5d4c962894e3a708f67022afb258e489c","amp;dn":"Tete+Montoliu+-+Live+At+The+Keystone+Corner+%281979%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd1a4fb5d4c962894e3a708f67022afb258e489c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,26,79,181,212,201,98,137,78,58,112,143,103,2,42,251,37,142,72,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
