If you've wondered why men find it hard to commit, why they provide solutions instead of empathy, why they can't just stop and ask directions, or why they spend so much time at work, this book is for you. Farrell addresses the other side of sexism, asking why women, if they want equality, expect men to pick up the check at dinner. He explains the male experience of being a &quot;success object&quot; as well as explaining why men make women into &quot;sex objects&quot; to lessen the pain of rejection. The listener learns what men talk about with the &quot;guys&quot; and why vulnerability is so difficult for men to express. Farrell initiates a dialog that will contribute to an understanding and maybe even a truce between the sexes.
