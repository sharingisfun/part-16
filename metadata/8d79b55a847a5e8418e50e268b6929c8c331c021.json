Each person's share turns out to be $50, and they decide to spend it at Costington's. Bart pays Gil Gunderson to walk up the down escalator, while Marge picks out a purse but mis-reads its $500 price tag as $50. Pressure from other shoppers leads her to charge it to her credit card; though she cannot afford it, Homer suggests that she use it until the store's return period is about to expire, then take it back. During dinner at a fancy restaurant, Marge tries her best to keep the purse clean, but Homer ruins it by dropping shrimp sauce on it. She is still able to return the purse despite this damage, and she and Homer begin buying other expensive items on credit and returning them in time for a refund. Homer is eventually caught doing so on camera by Chris Hansen in a special entitied To Catch a Credit Whore (a spoof of To Catch a Predator).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d79b55a847a5e8418e50e268b6929c8c331c021","amp;dn":"The+simpsons+s22e2+LOL.+%7EINVICTA+RG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d79b55a847a5e8418e50e268b6929c8c331c021","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,121,181,90,132,122,94,132,24,229,14,38,139,105,41,200,195,49,192,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
