Many of its songs reflect a more conventional pop-writing style which became radio hits. Others still retained Gabriel's dark, brooding sense of experimentalism and are held as classics by his more eclectic fans. It was Gabriel's first studio album to bear an official title; the name corresponds to the fifth note of the scale &quot;do re mi fa so la ti do&quot;.\n\nIt is Peter Gabriel's second album produced by Canadian artist Daniel Lanois. The previous year, the two of them had worked together on Birdy. Lanois had been previously known for his ambient collaborations with Brian Eno as well as producing U2 since 1984. As he had with the soundtrack to the film Birdy, Lanois brought many of his own ambient sensibilities to this recording.\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 187 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\n\nNotes on the Re-Issue\n\nWhen the album was remastered, with most of Gabriel's catalog, in 2002, the song &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; was moved from the 5th song to the 9th song. This was what Peter Gabriel originally intended, but because of the limitations of the vinyl release format it was moved up to be the first track on side two (where there is naturally more room for the grooves). Oddly, the credits in the booklet were not changed to show the change in order (so, Youssou N'dour, instead of being credited with back up vocals to &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; is given credit for back up vocals on &quot;Mercy Street&quot;).\n\nSACD Track Listing\n\n1.&quot;Red Rain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:39\n2.&quot;Sledgehammer&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:55\n3.&quot;Don't Give Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:55\n4.&quot;That Voice Again&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:53\n5.&quot;Mercy Street&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:22\n6.&quot;Big Time&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28\n7.&quot;We Do What We're Told (Milgram's 37)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22\n8.&quot;This Is the Picture (Excellent Birds)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n9.&quot;In Your Eyes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:27\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nThe track numbers only correspond to the original release, not the remastered version.\n\nPeter Gabriel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, synthesizers, piano on tracks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, percussion on track 4, Linn on tracks 3, 7, 9, Synclavier on track 9\nTony Levin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass on tracks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9\nDavid Rhodes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar on tracks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, backing vocals on tracks 1, 5\nJerry Marotta ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums on tracks 1, 5, 8, drumstic bass on track 7\nManu KatchÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums on tracks 2, 3, 4, 5, percussion on tracks 3, 4, 5, talking drum on tracks 5, 9\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76992761ddd918459026130842720243fd5d68ab","amp;dn":"Peter+Gabriel+-+So+%5BSAPGCD5%5D+Hybrid+SACD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76992761ddd918459026130842720243fd5d68ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,153,39,97,221,217,24,69,144,38,19,8,66,114,2,67,253,93,104,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
