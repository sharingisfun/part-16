Boyce &amp; Hart had yet more talent, though, and not only plied the Monkees with hit songs but, in some cases, performed them, too. Tommy Boyce enjoyed minor teen idol success as a solo act with &quot;I'll Remember Carol&quot; in 1962 before teaming up with Bobby Hart to produce one Top Ten hit (&quot;I Wonder What She's Doing Tonite&quot;) and a handful of lesser chart entries. This Australian anthology, simply titled The Anthology, contains two of Boyce's solo recordings (including his hit), 18 A&amp;M recordings from Boyce &amp; Hart's prime (including all of their hits), and five songs the duo cut with the Monkees' Davy Jones and Micky Dolenz in the '70s. The Boyce &amp; Hart recordings are the highlights, especially the bubblegum pop of songs such as &quot;I Wonder What She's Doing Tonite&quot; and &quot;The Countess.&quot; Listeners already familiar with the Monkees' albums will experience dÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ¡ vu throughout as Boyce &amp; Hart demonstrate again and again the extent to which they were the architects of the Monkees' sound. Even the Monkees' detours into pop psychedelia are matched by Boyce &amp; Hart on a trippy rendition of &quot;Jumpin' Jack Flash.&quot; The theme song from the 1967 spy film The Ambushers (complete with gunshot sound effects) is campy fun, as are the mid-'70s cover versions of &quot;Teenager in Love&quot; and the Beach Boys' &quot;Sail on Sailor,&quot; provided one doesn't approach them with high expectations. For those who want only the Boyce &amp; Hart recordings, a more recent compilation on Rev-Ola titled I Wonder What She's Doing Tonite: The Best of Boyce &amp; Hart limits its focus to recordings from the pair's late-'60s heyday.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:fvfyxqyjldae&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:fvfyxqyjldae&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSome reviews can be found here, but Amazon itself does not sell it: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/B000006U13&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/B000006U13&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
