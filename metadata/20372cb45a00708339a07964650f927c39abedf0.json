Because of that, some of the videos might not be\nideal for a compilation, but were chosen because they were the best available. Also, nobody had\nrecorded (or, at least, had uploaded up until now) the entire &quot;Art of Life's&quot; intro in good video\nquality, so that's why the second half of the violin solo and the beginning of the playback\npiano intro are missing. But it's nothing that compromises the fun.\nExcept by the RedeTV!'s video, all videos were downloaded from YouTube.\n\n-----\n\nTechnical specifications:\n\nVideo: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC,\nAudio: mp4a MPEG-4 AAC LC, 44100 Hz\nResolution: 480 x 360\nTotal length: 2:02:17 (01:59:17 of concert)\n\nVideos included:\n- X Japan Live in Brazil (11.09.2011).mkv\n- X Japan Live in Brazil - inside the hall before the start (11.09.2011).mp4\n\nIf you have trouble viewing the videos, update your codec pack or download a new one,\nlike K-Lite Mega Codec Pack.\n\n-----\n\nSetlist:\n\n1- New intro\n2- Jade\n3- Rusty Nail (Japanese version)\n4- Silent Jealousy (Japanese version)\n5- Drain\n6- Violin and piano solo\n7- Kurenai (Japanese version)\n8- Born To Be Free\n9- Drums solo\n10- I.V.\n11- X\n12- Forever Love (short version)\n13- Endless Rain\n14- Art of Life (2nd part)\n\n-----\n\nVideos owners by YouTube username:\n\nInside the hall before the start: TimePinkRanger\nIntro: alinealvesf07\nJade: RedeTV!
