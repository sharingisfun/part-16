All proceeds from the sale of the EP benefited the Mercury Phoenix Trust. Sales of the record were in fact very strong throughout Europe, where it debuted at number one, in the UK Singles Chart, and several European countries, either considered as a single, or charting on album charts as an extended play or an LP. Chart success in the U.S. was far less spectacular, but the EP still peaked at number 30 on the Billboard 200.  An edited shorter version of &quot;Killer&quot; and &quot;Papa Was a Rollin' Stone&quot;, a live medley performed by Michael at Wembley Arena, was released as a further independent single, in some territories only. The singer also shot a video for it, although he did not personally appear (it was during the time Michael refused to exploit his outward look, which he thought would distract the audience from the music, his main concern). The video was directed by Marcus Nispel.  While &quot;These Are the Days of Our Lives&quot; is played by the remaining members of Queen, it is actually a duet between George Michael and Lisa Stansfield. The version on the EP is not identical to the actual performance on the night, however.  The sixth trackÃ¢â‚¬â€only featured on some releasesÃ¢â‚¬â€is represented by a short performance by Queen, entitled &quot;Dear Friends&quot;, originally sung by Freddie Mercury himself. Recorded in 1974, this constitutes the one studio recording on the record. It was not included in the UK vinyl of the EP.  Usually, countries where the six-track work is distributed consider it to be a short LP, whereas those where the five-track (hence, its title) work is available generally tend to see it as an EP or even (if &quot;Killer&quot;/&quot;Papa Was a Rollin' Stone&quot; was not marketed independently in those same territories) as a particularly long or content-rich single. However, no matter its status, whether an EP, a short album or a long single, the work as a whole sold an estimated 5 million copies worldwide.\n\n\n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Somebody To Love - - - George Michael &amp; Queen\n[02] Killer - - - George Michael\n[03] Papa Was A Rollin' Stone - - - George Michael\n[04] These Are The Days Of Our Lives - - - George Michael With Lisa Stansfield\n[05] Calling You - - - George Michael\n[06] Dear Friends - - - Queen\n\nCD01 Play Time - 00h:28m:47s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 70.5mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
