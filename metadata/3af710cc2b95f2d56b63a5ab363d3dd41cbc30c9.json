What is my place in it? What choices does this obligate me to make? \n\nIf you?ve ever longed to enrich your own understanding of this unique philosophical movement, the \nvisionary thinkers it brought together to ponder these questions, and the prominent role it still \nplays in contemporary thought, you now have an opportunity to do so by ordering this freshly \nrecorded Third Edition of No Excuses: Existentialism and the Meaning of Life.\n\nProfessor Robert Solomon presents his 24 detailed lectures with gratifying lucidity and plenty of \nilluminating detail. His course enables you to grasp existentialism comprehensively, incisively, \nand in context. You will trace its roots back to its 19th-century forbears, examine the impact \nthat it made through its reconsideration of fundamental questions, and gain a keen sense of how \nthis profoundly original way of fathoming life continues to exert a profound influence today.\n\nProfessor Robert Solomon has decades of distinguished teaching at The University of Texas to his \ncredit. You will see why his high repute as a classroom lecturer is so well merited when you buy \nthese tapes and join him in exploring the religious existentialism of Kierkegaard, the warrior \nrhetoric and often-shocking claims about religion and morality of Nietzsche, the bold and profound \nfiction of Camus, the radical and uncompromising notion of freedom championed by Sartre, the \nsearching analysis of human historicity and finitude offered by Martin Heidegger, and more. \n\nUnder Professor Solomon?s clear guidance, you?ll see how these thinkers relate to one another, \nand to the larger tradition of philosophy itself. At the end of your survey, you may conclude \nthat one of the most remarkable things about existentialism is the way in which its great \nquestions allow room for different routes to the truth, so that this same grand arena of \nintellect can admit?and even welcome?many seemingly disparate voices.\n\nThe Third Edition of No Excuses tracks the popular earlier editions closely in terms of content. \nProfessor Solomon has reorganized his lectures into a half-hour format that is designed to make \nthem easier to use, especially for customers who commute. \n\nPart I\n\nLecture 1:  What is Existentialism? \nLecture 2:  Albert Camus?The Stranger, Part 1\nLecture 3:  Camus?The Stranger, Part II\nLecture 4:  Camus?The Myth of Sisyphus\nLecture 5:  Camus?The Plague and The Fall\nLecture 6:  Camus?The Fall, Part II\nLecture 7:  SÃƒÂ¸ren Kierkegaard?&quot;On Becoming a Christian&quot; \nLecture 8:  Kierkegaard on Subjective Truth \nLecture 9:  Kierkegaard&amp;#039;s Existential Dialectic \nLecture 10:  Friedrich Nietzsche on Nihilism and the Death of God\nLecture 11:  Nietzsche, the &quot;Immoralist&quot; \nLecture 12: Nietzsche on Freedom, Fate, and Responsibility \n \n\nPart II\n\nLecture 13:  Nietzsche?The ÃƒÅ“bermensch and the Will to Power \nLecture 14:  Three Grand Inquisitors: Dostoevsky, Kafka, Hesse\nLecture 15:  Husserl, Heidegger, and Phenomenology\nLecture 16:  Heidegger on the World and the Self\nLecture 17:  Heidegger on &quot;Authenticity&quot;\nLecture 18:  Jean-Paul Sartre at War\nLecture 19:  Sartre on Emotions and Responsibility \nLecture 20:  Sartre&amp;#039;s Phenomenology\nLecture 21:  Sartre on &quot;Bad Faith&quot;  \nLecture 22:  Sartre&amp;#039;s Being-for-Others and No Exit\nLecture 23:  Sartre on Sex and Love\nLecture 24:  From Existentialism to Postmodernism\n\n\nMore related uploads: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/BhangWalla&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/BhangWalla&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3af710cc2b95f2d56b63a5ab363d3dd41cbc30c9","amp;dn":"TTC+-+Existentialism+And+The+Meaning+Of+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3af710cc2b95f2d56b63a5ab363d3dd41cbc30c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,247,16,204,43,149,242,213,107,99,165,171,54,61,61,212,28,188,48,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
