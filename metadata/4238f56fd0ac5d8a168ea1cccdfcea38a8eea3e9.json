Few people ever visit Scrape, and the unlucky ones who live there never seem to escape. They fill their days with fish fries, cheap beer, tobacco, firearms, and sex. But Scrape is about to be invaded by a plague of monsters unlike anything ever seen in the history of the world. First there's La Llorona -- the screaming woman in white -- and her horde of ghost children. Then come the black, hairy hands. Thousands, millions, scurrying on fingers like spiders or crabs. But the hands are nothing to El Abuelo, a wicked creature with a magical bullwhip, and even El Abuelo don't mean shit when the devil comes to town.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4238f56fd0ac5d8a168ea1cccdfcea38a8eea3e9","amp;dn":"The+Last+Horror+Novel+in+the+History+of+the+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4238f56fd0ac5d8a168ea1cccdfcea38a8eea3e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,56,245,111,208,172,93,138,22,142,161,204,205,252,234,56,168,238,163,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
