Rose, an optometrist paralyzed by crushing grief after the death of her infant, has built a \nwall around herself, unable to relate to her estranged husband or anyone else. When an elderly patient, a painter losing his eyesight, begins to visit her office unannounced, Rose registers how alone he is, urging him to reach out and ask for help--something neither does easily. Meanwhile Simon, a late-blooming teenager \nwith an overbearing mother, photographs people at a distance with a borrowed long lens. One day, Rose, beautiful and melancholy in a vibrant scarf, comes into focus in his camera sight. The pictures he shoots become a conduit for each of them to touch something deep within and expand their confining existence. \n\nInfo:\n\nVideo:592x336\nFrames:25.000/s\nLen:1:26:46\nFrms:130,12\nkbps:982\nQf:0.197\n\nAudio:\n0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\n48000Hz 128 kb/s tot,Joint Stereo LAME3.90.\n\nFile Length Correct\nOpenDML (AVI v2.0)\nInterleave: 1 vid frame (40 ms), preload=504\nAudio frames: Aligned on interleaves\nVideo: 609 MB (87.49%)\nAudio: 79.2 MB (11.37%)\nAVI Overhead: 7.95 MB (1.14%)\n\n[ISFT]VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n[JUNK]VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n[USER]XviD0046\n\nEnjoy.....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cde580612769f54acd931e261e1829e8bfb93c63","amp;dn":"Adrift+In+Manhattan-DVDRip%5BEng%5D2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cde580612769f54acd931e261e1829e8bfb93c63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,229,128,97,39,105,245,74,205,147,30,38,30,24,41,232,191,185,60,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
