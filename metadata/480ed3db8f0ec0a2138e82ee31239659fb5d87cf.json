The converted wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Olatunji Concert: The Last Live RecordingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ documents a live performance on April 23, 1967 in New York. John Coltrane would play once more in front of a live crowd on May 7, 1967 in Baltimore, but the last available live recording is documented here. It demonstrates his sonic blast free jazz direction that was becoming more aggressive and out of bounds. \nThe two extended compositions on this date, the Afro-Brazilian folk tune &quot;Ogunde&quot; and &quot;My Favorite Things,&quot; are taken to their harmonic and rhythmic limits by Coltrane and company, Pharoah Sanders, Alice Coltrane, Rashied Ali, and Jimmy Garrison totally ripping it up. \nColtrane quite simply went where no musician had gone before.\n\n\nJohn Coltrane\n\nThe Olatunji Concert:\nThe Last Live Recording\n\n1967\n\n\n  CD / 2001 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
