It was originally featured on their 1980 album &quot;British Steel&quot;. which was their first gold album in the United States selling more than 500,000 copies. The song speaks to the hedonistic, rebellious spirit of the 1980s, and is among the band's most popular songs.The music video, directed by Julien Temple and shot live at the Sheffield City Hall, begins with drummer Dave Holland playing an invisible drum kit. During the guitar solo, fans on the front row play along with their cardboard guitars (which were the prominent fan symbols of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement).\n       &quot;Rock You Like a Hurricane&quot; is a song by the German heavy metal band Scorpions. The song was released as the second track of their 1984 album &quot;Love at First Sting&quot;. &quot;Rock You Like a Hurricane&quot; reached number 25 in the USA Billboard Hot 100, greatly contributing to the album's success, and MTV put the video in heavy rotation.\n       &quot;Wild Child&quot; is a  song written and performed by  W.A.S.P, released as a single in November 1985 and included in the album &quot;The Last Command&quot; of the same year.The album was produced by Spencer Proffer, who was perhaps best known for producing the six-time Platinum selling album &quot;Metal Health&quot; by Quiet Riot in 1983. &quot;The Last Command&quot; is the first W.A.S.P. album to feature the work of drummer Steve Riley. The album reached No. 47 on the Billboard 200 album chart in early 1986 and sold over one million copies, their first album to do so. It was also the last album to feature founding member Randy Piper on guitar.\n       &quot;Gypsy Road&quot; was a #51 US hit for Cinderella in 1989, from their second album, &quot;Long Cold Winter&quot;, which was released almost a whole year before. \n        &quot;Antisocial&quot; is a song by the French hard rock band Trust, from their album &quot;RÃƒÂ©pression&quot;. The song was written by Bernie Bonvoisin and Norbert Krief.  American thrash metal band Anthrax covered the song, using the alternate English lyrics, on their 1988 album State of Euphoria. Their cover of the song also appears on the second disc of their compilation album, Anthrology: No Hit Wonders (1985-1991), along with a version featuring the verses sung in French.\n        &quot;The Toxic Waltz&quot;  is a song by heavy metal band Exodus, released as a single in January  1989 and included in the album &quot;Fabulous Disaster&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:429720f29e0605b9662e05f3f0188819e8958d37","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+491","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"429720f29e0605b9662e05f3f0188819e8958d37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,151,32,242,158,6,5,185,102,46,5,243,240,24,136,25,232,149,141,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
