A combination of talkers, screamers and being about as far away from the speakers as I could be without being outside made for a poor recording. I debated whether or not to even share this one due to the quality, but I figured it was better than nothing, even if barely. Also, I've had a few people contact me about recording concerts, and I've accomodated a couple, but I just want to make people aware of something. Unless someone like Bob Dylan decides to play First Avenue, I will not be stepping foot inside that place again. It is easily one of the worst venues I've been to out of the 30 or more I've been to in my life. With all that said, Dessa put on a great show, as usual, and her new album is fantastic, be sure to pick it up if you haven't already. Also, the opener, Zoo Animal, put on a great show as well, I recorded their set but all the problems with Dessa's recording were about 3x worse on their set, so I didn't even bother to post it. But, please, check them out as they put out some quality music.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://music4humans.us/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://music4humans.us/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca297996d43e6b7052f68e9fe12da4a2bd8f3b17","amp;dn":"Dessa+-+6-29-13%2C+First+Avenue%2C+Minneapolis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca297996d43e6b7052f68e9fe12da4a2bd8f3b17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,41,121,150,212,62,107,112,82,246,142,159,225,45,164,162,189,143,59,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
