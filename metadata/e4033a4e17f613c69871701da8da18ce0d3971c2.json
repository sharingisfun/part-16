It was produced by Christian R. Donaldson (Cryptopsy, Mythosis). The album demonstrates a more diverse sound than The Agonist's debut album and features classical, jazz, opera, grindcore, thrash, and black metal influences. It features guest violins by Avi Ludmer (Mahogany Rush) and orchestrations by classical pianists Melina Soochan and Jonathan Lefrancois-Leduc (Blackguard).[1] In 2009 the band released two videos from the album, &quot;...And Their Eulogies Sang Me to Sleep&quot; and &quot;Thank You, Pain&quot;.\n\n\n\n.\t&quot;The Tempest (The Siren's Song; The Banshee's Cry)&quot;  \t4:46\n2.\t&quot;...And Their Eulogies Sang Me to Sleep.&quot;  \t3:32\n3.\t&quot;Thank You, Pain.&quot;  \t3:44\n4.\t&quot;Birds Elope with the Sun&quot;  \t4:29\n5.\t&quot;Waiting Out the Winter&quot;  \t4:03\n6.\t&quot;Martyr Art&quot;  \t4:31\n7.\t&quot;Globus Hystericus&quot;  \t3:41\n8.\t&quot;Swan Lake (A Cappella)&quot;  \t2:53\n9.\t&quot;The Sentient&quot;  \t3:39\n10.\t&quot;When the Bough Breaks&quot;  \t4:13\n11.\t&quot;Chlorpromazine&quot;  \t4:07\nTotal length:\n43:22\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4033a4e17f613c69871701da8da18ce0d3971c2","amp;dn":"The+Agonist++-+Lullabies+For+The+Dormant+Mind+%282009%29++%5BVBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4033a4e17f613c69871701da8da18ce0d3971c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,3,58,78,23,246,19,198,152,113,112,29,168,218,24,206,13,57,113,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
