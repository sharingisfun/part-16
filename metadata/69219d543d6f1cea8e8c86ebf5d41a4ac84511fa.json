Perhaps most startling of all is that alcohol, solvents and tobacco (all unclassified drugs) are rated more dangerous than ecstasy, 4-MTA and LSD (all class A drugs). If the current ABC system is retained, alcohol would be rated a class A drug and tobacco class B.\n\nThe scientists involved, including members of the government&amp;#039;s top advisory committee on drug classification, have produced a rigorous assessment of the social and individual harm caused by 20 of the UK&amp;#039;s most dangerous drugs and believe this should form the basis of future ranking. They think the current ABC system is arbitrary and not based on any scientific evidence.\n\nThe drug policies have remained unchanged over the last 40 years so should they be reformed in the light of new research?\n\n\n1) Further Information \n * BBC Horizon page\n * Live Debate following the broadcast\n\n2) Related Documentaries \n * The Prince of Pot\n * Cocaine City\n * Hooked: Illegal Drugs and How they Got that Way\n * The Truth about Binge Drinking\n * The Meth Epidemic\n * Taboo Drugs\n * The Ice Age (Meth Addiction in Australia)\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\nGSpot v2.70a avi file details:\n------------------------------\n *  Filename.....: BBC.Horizon.2008-02-05.Is.Alcohol.Worse.than.Ecstasy.DVBC.XviD.MP3.MVGroup.avi\n *  Filesize.....: 669,769,442 bytes\n *  Runtime......: 49:21.000 (74025 frames)\n *  Video Codec..: XviD ISO MPEG-4 (B-VOP//)\n *  Video Bitrate: 1672 kbps\n *  Aspect Ratio.: 672x384 (1.750)\n *  Framerate....: 25.000 fps\n *  Bitstream....: Unpacked\n *  Audio Codec..: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\n *  Audio Bitrate: 129kbps 2ch VBR 48000Hz\n *  Language.....: English\n *  Subtitles....: Yes - English\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n3) ed2k Links \n\ned2k://|file|BBC.Horizon.2008-02-05.Is.Alcohol.Worse.than.Ecstasy.DVBC.XviD.MP3.MVGroup.avi\ned2k://|file|BBC.Horizon.2008-02-05.Is.Alcohol.Worse.than.Ecstasy.DVBC.XviD.MP3.MVGroup.en.srt\n\n\nSource: http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Is_Alcohol_Worse_than_Ecstasy\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69219d543d6f1cea8e8c86ebf5d41a4ac84511fa","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon+-+2008-02-05+-+Is+Alcohol+Worse+than+Ecstasy%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69219d543d6f1cea8e8c86ebf5d41a4ac84511fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,33,157,84,61,111,28,234,142,140,134,235,245,212,26,74,200,69,17,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
