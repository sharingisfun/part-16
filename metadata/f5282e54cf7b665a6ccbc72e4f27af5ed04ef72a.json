Yost\n\n2013 | ISBN: 0813345901 | English | 376 Pages | PDF | 3.20 MB\n\nComputer: A History of the Information Machine traces the history of the computer and shows how business and government were the first to explore its unlimited, information-processing potential. Old-fashioned entrepreneurship combined with scientific know-how inspired now famous computer engineers to create the technology that became IBM. Wartime needs drove the giant ENIAC, the first fully electronic computer. Later, the PC enabled modes of computing that liberated people from room-sized, mainframe computers.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5282e54cf7b665a6ccbc72e4f27af5ed04ef72a","amp;dn":"Computer%3A+A+History+of+the+Information+Machine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5282e54cf7b665a6ccbc72e4f27af5ed04ef72a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,40,46,84,207,123,102,90,108,203,199,46,79,39,175,94,208,78,247,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
