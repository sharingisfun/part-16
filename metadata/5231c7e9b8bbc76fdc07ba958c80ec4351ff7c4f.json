I have no time for activities which do not add anything to my bottom line. OH and I love FREE TRAFFIC. \n\nHere is what the system is NOT about:\n\n- No spending money on expensive PPC ads.\n\n- No time wasting on so called WEB 2.0 crap and spamming the hell out of them.\n\n- No posting ads on Craigslist or other classified sites.\n\n- No making 100s of sites hoping each will make you 50 cents a day. \n\n- No writing hundreds of articles building somebody else's business.\n\n- No piggybacking off product launches to make money for a week and then have the sites die out.\n\n- Nothing BlueFart\n\nWe crank out sites that take a few hours to make and promote and get our slice of Google's traffic. I like this idea so much that I call it &quot;Google Slicer&quot;. How creative am I?\n\nWe are not talking about little traffic either. Slicer sites get thousands of visitors a month bringing in long term hands off income. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5231c7e9b8bbc76fdc07ba958c80ec4351ff7c4f","amp;dn":"Google+Slicer+-+The+BluePrint+To+Five+Figure+A+Month.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5231c7e9b8bbc76fdc07ba958c80ec4351ff7c4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,49,199,233,184,187,199,111,220,7,186,149,140,128,236,67,81,255,124,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
