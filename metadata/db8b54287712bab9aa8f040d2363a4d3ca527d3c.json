While weaving in meaningful examples from practice throughout the text, the authors coach students on how to navigate between conceptualizing about a population-focus while also continuing to advocate and care for individuals, families, and aggregates. \nThis student-friendly, highly illustrated text engages students, and by doing so, eases students into readily applying public health principles along with evidence-based practice, nursing science, and skills that promote health, prevent disease, as well as protect at-risk populations!  What the 8th edition of this text does best is assist students in broadening the base of their knowledge and skills that they can employ in both the community and acute care settings, while the newly enhanced ancillary resources offers interactive tools that allow students of all learning styles to master public health nursing.\n\nBRIEF CONTENTS\nUnit 1 - Foundations of Community Health Nursing\nUnit 2 - Public Health Essentials for Community Health Nursing\nUnit 3 - Community Health Nursing Toolbox\nUnit 4 - The Community as Client\nUnit 5 - The Family as Client\nUnit 6 - Promoting and Protecting the Health of Populations with Developmental Needs\nUnit 7 - Promoting and Protecting the Health of Vulnerable Populations\nUnit 8 - Settings for Community Health Nursing\nIndex ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db8b54287712bab9aa8f040d2363a4d3ca527d3c","amp;dn":"Community+%26amp%3B+Public+Health+Nursing+%288th+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db8b54287712bab9aa8f040d2363a4d3ca527d3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,139,84,40,119,18,186,185,170,143,4,13,35,99,164,211,202,82,125,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
