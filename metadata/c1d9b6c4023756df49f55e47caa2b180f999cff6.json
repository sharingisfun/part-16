Written by Ed \nStephan {&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;fb888f9e8b939a95bb9898d58c8c8ed59e9f8e&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;} \n\nTrivia:\n\n    * The original working title for this film was &quot;The Californian&quot;.\n\n    * During filming, &amp;#039;Tyrone Power (I)&amp;#039; was in the habit of taking an early \nmorning swim in a pool that he insisted on being carefully pre-heated. Darryl F. \nZanuck played a prank on him by arranging for the heating to be turned off. \nPower dived in and got such a shock that he later claimed he nearly had a heart \nattack. He got his revenge. Zanuck watched the dailies every day with a critical \neye and one evening saw something unexpected; the cast and crew collaborated to \nfilm a spoof version of the hold-up scene where Zorro robs a coach carrying the \nGovernor and his wife. When Zorro is supposed to slash his Z into the vehicle&amp;#039;s \nupholstery, the camera reveals he has slashed &quot;DZ&quot;. &quot;Oh my God, it&amp;#039;s Zanuck&quot; his \nvictims gasp. Power responds: &quot;That&amp;#039;s right, you bastards...&quot; and describes the \nproducer in very unflattering language.\n\n    * In DC comic lore, this version of Zorro with &amp;#039;Tyrone Power (I)&amp;#039; is the \nmovie that a young Bruce Wayne goes to see the night his parents are mugged and \nshot by Joe Chill. After coming out of the movie and walking through an alley \nwith Bruce is when they are mugged, and what leads to Batman&amp;#039;s creation. This \nfact is mentioned in the 1986 Frank Miller comic The Dark Knight Returns.\n\n    * Like most of the actors who portrayed Zorro at around this time, &amp;#039;Tyrone \nPower (I)&amp;#039; was not of Hispanic heritage (he was of British descent).\n\n    * Basil Rathbone, being a well known fencer in his own right, was asked how \nwell &amp;#039;Tyrone Power (I)&amp;#039; did in their scenes in which stunt doubles were not \nused. Rathbone responded, &quot; Tyrone Power could fence Errol Flynn into a box!&quot;\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Personal Info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy releases so far... personal rips from original DVDs, looking for quality.\nWhenever there&amp;#039;s an AC3 file, there&amp;#039;s 99% possibilities this is the directly\nripped audio track from the DVD, untouched.\n\nThey&amp;#039;re usually uploaded in TPB, Mininova and TorrentBox, but feel free to share \nthem on edonkey networks or in any way you want.
