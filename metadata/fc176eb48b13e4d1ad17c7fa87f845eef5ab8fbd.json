All Bland had to offer was his magnificent voice, a tremendously powerful instrument in his early heyday, injected with charisma and melisma to spare. Just ask his legion of female fans, who deemed him a sex symbol late into his career.\n\nFor all his promise, Bland's musical career ignited slowly. He was a founding member of the Beale Streeters, the fabled Memphis aggregation that also included B.B. King and Johnny Ace. Singles for Chess in 1951 (produced by Sam Phillips) and Modern the next year bombed, but that didn't stop local DJ David Mattis from cutting Bland on a couple of 1952 singles for his fledgling Duke logo. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:hifuxq95ldje~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:hifuxq95ldje~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nPicking up right where the first volume left off and continuing into 1964, this two-disc compilation (50 tracks!) showcases one of Bland's most appealing periods at Duke. Joe Scott was experimenting boldly with his protegÃƒÂ©'s repertoire, his brass-powered arrangements urging Bland to increased heights of incendiary energy on &quot;Turn on Your Love Light&quot; and &quot;Yield Not to Temptation&quot; (driven by future James Brown drummer Jabo Starks's funky traps) and advanced sophistication levels for the honey-smooth &quot;Share Your Love with Me&quot; and &quot;That's the Way Love Is.&quot; Bennett's crackling blues licks invest &quot;Stormy Monday Blues,&quot; &quot;The Feeling Is Gone,&quot; and &quot;Black Night&quot; with T-Bone-derived tradition, while Bland handles Charlie Rich's &quot;Who Will the Next Fool Be&quot; with just the right amount of bluesy resignation.\n\nTrack List:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
