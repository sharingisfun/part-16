It seems some sour soul has angered St. Nick, calling Christmas a fraudulent myth! The skeptical rodent Albert Mouse has to be brought to his senses and let up a little on the wonder why. How Albert is persuaded to change his tune paves the way for Santa's jolly return to Junctionville -- and the joyous finale of this charming animated fable inspired by Clement Moore's poem.\n\nA enjoyable classic for kids as well as adults alike. \n\nRuntime:  25 mins\nLanguage: English\nYear: 2010\nQuality: 9/10\nFormat: avi format \n\nSee reviews here,  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Twas-Night-Before-Christmas-Joel/dp/B003U0AHG4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Twas-Night-Before-Christmas-Joel/dp/B003U0AHG4&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI would ask every Christian to do 2 things.\n\n1. If possible please buy this movie. Do you know that there are 2.2 billion Christians on earth today. But only a privileged few, around 12% have the means and the accessibility to buy Christian films. Many Christians are too poor to buy movies or live in places where Christian films are not available. \nThat's not all. Out of the 12% who have the means and accessibility to buy Christian media, only around 0.5% ever buys a Christian movie. In other words only 1 out of 200 Christians ever buys a Christian movie. Pathetic isn't it?\nPlease buy the movies to keep Christian films in business. And please do pray for the Christian movie makers and their families.\n\n2. Please seed the movies for as long as possible. If possible make copies and distribute to your poor neighbors. And please do pray for the movie makers and their families. Remember the Kingdom of Heaven is in you and so is the choice of Heaven/Hell. \n\nPS: If you need any specific Christian movie or have something to say then kindly send a mail to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;98f1f6fcf1f9f6fbf0eaf1ebecf1f9f6aaa8a8a1d8e1f9f0f7f7b6fbf7b6f1f6&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nKindly mention the subject as Christian Movies or something similar. \n\n&quot;Don't ask me what Christ can do for you! He has done all he could. Tell me what you can do for Christ?&quot;\n\nUploaded by Indian Christian\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c82a3caf608227978004ed274ad1f90db6b7dac","amp;dn":"Twas+the+Night+Before+Christmas+%28Ultimate+Christmas+Classics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c82a3caf608227978004ed274ad1f90db6b7dac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,130,163,202,246,8,34,121,120,0,78,210,116,173,31,144,219,107,125,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
