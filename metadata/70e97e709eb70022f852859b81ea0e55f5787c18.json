Much of the film is told through flashbacks spanning George&amp;#039;s entire life and narrated by Franklin and Joseph, unseen Angels who are preparing Clarence for his mission to save George. Through these flashbacks we see all the people whose lives have been touched by George and the difference he has made to the community in which he lives.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70e97e709eb70022f852859b81ea0e55f5787c18","amp;dn":"+Its+a+Wonderful+Life+%281946%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70e97e709eb70022f852859b81ea0e55f5787c18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,233,126,112,158,183,0,34,248,82,133,155,129,234,14,85,245,120,124,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
