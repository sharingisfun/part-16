Content, the 18th and 19th century history of chemistry (highlight, Lavoisier refutes the phlogisticon theory). They only touch briefly upon the Greek beginnings. My own scans but possibly already posted elsewhere. I am no unconditional Asimov reader. The Willy Ley essays (40ties, 50ties and 60ties) deals mainly with notation (underlying question, why did it take so long for chemistry to become an exact science).\n\n-----------------\n\nEthnography gone wrong, Atlantis\n\nI did add three orphaned FYI files to this small torrent.  \n\nWilly Ley_Another Look at Atlantis ('rock solid', Thera explodes)\nWilly Ley_News from Atlantis (Eric the Red shows up)\nWilly Ley_Vineta (Q&amp;A snippet)\n \n\nVersion 2014-03\n\n***","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f556760f54d45a73f7760efa7de04f7f48dba2c","amp;dn":"Willy+Ley+and+Isaac+Asimov+-+Essays+on+Chemistry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f556760f54d45a73f7760efa7de04f7f48dba2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,85,103,96,245,77,69,167,63,119,96,239,167,222,4,247,244,141,186,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
