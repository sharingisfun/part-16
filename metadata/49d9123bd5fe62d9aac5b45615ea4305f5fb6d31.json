Christine Love makes great quality games, and I don't want to lose her!\nAnalogue: A Hate Story is $10 USD on Steam, and Hate Plus is also $10 USD on Steam.\n\nThis torrent is a fixed version of this torrent: BEB8587DFD95907D0AD61E9D592321D8C04A5253\nThe character problem and other fixes in 3cb5a26a2ee3b7fd2c3b8905a803f533067c5707 gist has been applied to this torrent.\n\nI repacked this game with Ren'Py 6.99.\nThis packages contains Mac (x86_64), Linux (x86 and x86_64), and Windows versions.\nAnalogue: A Hate Story is in English, Korean, and Japanese.\nHate Plus is in English and Korean.\n\n\nBack in the 25th century, Earth launched a generation ship into deep space, with the goal of establishing the first interstellar colony. It dropped out of contact and disappeared, never reaching its destination.\n\nThousands of years later, it has finally been found.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Analogue is a sit-up-and-take-notice achievement in storytelling, in interface, in research, in mechanics and in moral ambiguity.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Alec Meer, Rock Paper Shotgun\n    \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“It was like watching a horror movie, knowing what was about to happen and curious only how awful the directorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s willing to get. Love is not gratuitous but doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t disappoint Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the fate of the Mugunghwa, and the event that precipitated it, is as valid as it is appalling.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Matt Sakey, Tap-Repeatedly\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A visually stunning game with an interesting story... this game stands as an example of how a text adventure can look and feel nowadays.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€IndieCade, 2012 Finalist\n\nUncover the mystery of what happened to the final generation aboard the generation ship Mugunghwa by reading through its dead crew's logs, with the help of a spunky AI sidekick!\n\nTwo pursuable characters. Five endings. A dark visual novel that further extends the non-linear style of Digital: A Love Story in a mystery featuring transhumanism, traditional marriage, loneliness, and cosplay.\n\nWelcome to the future.\n\nI can't believe it! My mission was supposed to be routine data recovery on an old derelict generation ship, but instead, I ended up rescuing an adorable AI girl who grew up in a tremendously patriarchal Neo-Confucian society? And now she's discovered a bunch of messages left by the mysterious Old *Mute... and wants me to uncover with her the slow enactment of a regressive political program that caused her society to regress to Joseon Dynasty social mores?!\n\nI wasn't expecting this at all! I thought the three day trip back to Earth would be peaceful and lonely and not at all filled with reading about tragedy!\n\nAnd so began my hateful days...\n\n    \nLet's spend the next three real-time days together uncovering the mystery of year zero on the Mugunghwa, with the help of a spunky/more-than-slightly-traumatized AI sidekick!\n\nA sequel to Analogue: A Hate Story that tells a whole new hate story of its own. Analogue players can pick up where their finished save files left off, and new players can start fresh in Hate Plus.\n\nA dark visual novel about transhumanism, cosplay, cake-baking, and the slow patriarchal erosion of freedoms taken for granted.\n\nÃ¢â„¢Â¡ Please, look forward to your hateful days~!
