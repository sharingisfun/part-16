Memory optimisation \ncan also help reduce frame-rate stuttering.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fixed graphical glitches on AMD and Intel GPUs causing broken corneas: no more crazy laser eyes!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Added checkboxes to disable camera effects.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fixed frame-rate issue in ZoÃƒÂ«'s apartment.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Collision fixes in various locations. No more escaping through the scenery! (At least, we hope so. Please report any remaining loopholes.)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Changed eye-icon to F-icon (or equivalent key binding) when drawing the player's attention to an object or character.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fixed a bug where 'Consequence' text was out of bounds and did not display correctly in some languages.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fixed a bug where the 'submit changes' and 'revert changes' buttons would be incorrectly displayed when showing the UI the first time.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fixed a bug where labels/text for items in drop-down lists would disappear (and made the lists look better).\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The player should no longer be able to open the inventory when there are no inventory items. This addresses issues players were having while opening the inventory in House of All Worlds, resulting in either seeing ZÃƒÂ¶e's items from \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Europolis or creating a bug where the cursor would be stuck on screen, making it harder to move around.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ No more interactables on moved or removed assets (e.g. invisible cars on Kaprova).\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ On start-up, depth-of-field is disabled on Macs with integrated Intel GPU. This can be manually re-enabled but will affect frame-rate.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Replaced missing lightmaps in Pandemonium.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Wrong gender on one of the NPCs near Pandemonium\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Fixed window and door camera collisions in Dr Roman's office to avoid camera \nclipping through surfaces.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Rebaked occlusion map to avoid vanishing scenery on the rooftop in Friar's Keep, \nSister Sahya's office, Dr Roman's office and in Europolis.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Added missing French subtitles for Sister Sayahs office.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Added version number in title settings menu: you can finally see which version of the game you're running!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fix for buggy save-game thumbnails.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Footsteps have been fixed in Friar's Keep.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Shi*bot regains missing flapping fabric animations for his stupid mouth.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Reduced reverb in dreaming girl's bedroom in Storytime, and in the Hand that Feeds.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Removed non-functional talk action on vendor in Europolis.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ De-synced synchronised NPC animations in Friar's Keep (Murron's guards) and in \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Europolis (EYE guards harassing Nela).\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Added buzzer interaction if Zoe goes to Pandemonium directly after Nela.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Added missing lip-sync and missing subtitle for Mr London.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Collision fix on stairs to university lab in Europolis","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9781a7ab49a7d58b1751e54df22b4c5233f36e4d","amp;dn":"Dreamfall+Chapters+%28Book+One%29+%281.1.2+Patch%29+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9781a7ab49a7d58b1751e54df22b4c5233f36e4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,129,167,171,73,167,213,139,23,81,229,77,242,43,76,82,51,243,110,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
