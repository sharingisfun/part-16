Le Guin - 1974\nThe Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia is a 1974 utopian science fiction novel by Ursula K. Le Guin, set in the same fictional universe as that of The Left Hand of Darkness (the Hainish Cycle). The book won the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1974, both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1975, and received a nomination for the John W. Campbell Memorial Award in 1975. It is also notable for achieving a degree of literary recognition unusual for science fiction works.\n\nThe story explores many ideas and themes, including anarchism and revolutionary societies, capitalism, individualism and collectivism, and the SapirÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Whorf hypothesis.\n\nIt is also notable for its description of the invention of the new physics that is the basis for the fictional ansible, an instantaneous communications device that plays a critical role in Le Guin's Hainish Cycle. (The invention of the ansible places the novel first in the internal chronology of the Hainish Cycle, although it was the fifth Hainish novel published).\nISBN: 0380003821\n311 pages","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bb19848fda212aa1e59661620827a184c916933","amp;dn":"The+Dispossessed+-+Ursula+K.+Le+Guin+-+1974","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bb19848fda212aa1e59661620827a184c916933","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,177,152,72,253,162,18,170,30,89,102,22,32,130,122,24,76,145,105,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
