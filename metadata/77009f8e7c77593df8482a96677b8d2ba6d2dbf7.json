The student body at Greendale Community College is made up of high-school losers, newly divorced housewives, and old people who want to keep their minds active. Within these not-so-hallowed halls, Community focuses on a band of misfits, at the center of which is a fast-talkin' lawyer whose degree has been revoked (Joel McHale), who form a study group and end up learning a lot more about themselves than they do about their course work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77009f8e7c77593df8482a96677b8d2ba6d2dbf7","amp;dn":"Community.S05E02.HDTV.x264-LOL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77009f8e7c77593df8482a96677b8d2ba6d2dbf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,0,159,142,124,119,89,61,248,72,42,150,103,123,141,43,166,210,219,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
