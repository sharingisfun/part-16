We follow them as they roam Europe, on the run from governments amidst an age of revolution and a secret network of would-be revolutionaries, and see Karl not only as an intellectual, but as a protective father and loving husband, a revolutionary, a jokester, a man of tremendous passions, both political and personal. \n\nIn LOVE AND CAPITAL, Mary Gabriel has given us a vivid, resplendent, and truly human portrait of the Marxes-their desires, heartbreak and devotion to each other's ideals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f971b43cbf90861beb7971f4bdc3b2cb076d8fc","amp;dn":"Love+and+Capital+%5BKindle%2Fmobi+RETAIL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f971b43cbf90861beb7971f4bdc3b2cb076d8fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,151,27,67,203,249,8,97,190,183,151,31,75,220,59,44,176,118,216,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
