Although Sting, Andy Summers, and Stewart Copeland were all superb instrumentalists with jazz backgrounds, it was much easier to get a record contract in late-'70s England if you were a punk/new wave artist, so the band decided to mask their instrumental prowess with a set of strong, adrenaline-charged rock, albeit with a reggae tinge.\n\nSome of it may have been simplistic (&quot;Be My Girl-Sally,&quot; &quot;Born in the '50s&quot;), but Sting was already an ace songwriter, as evidenced by all-time classics like the good-girl-gone-bad tale of &quot;Roxanne,&quot; and a pair of brokenhearted reggae-rock ditties, &quot;Can't Stand Losing You&quot; and &quot;So Lonely.&quot; But like all other Police albums, the lesser-known album cuts are often highlights themselves -- the frenzied rockers &quot;Next to You,&quot; &quot;Peanuts,&quot; and &quot;Truth Hits Everybody,&quot; as well as more exotic fare like the groovy album closer &quot;Masoko Tanga&quot; and the lonesome &quot;Hole in My Life.&quot; Outlandos d'Amour is unquestionably one of the finest debuts to come out of the '70s punk/new wave movement.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
