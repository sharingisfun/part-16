On opening night Rex Harrison, who was unaccustomed to singing in front of a live orchestra, &quot;announced that under no circumstances would he go on that night...with those thirty-two interlopers in the pit&quot;. He locked himself in his\ndressing room and came out little more than an hour before curtain time. The whole company had been dismissed but were rounded up by the assistant stage manager. The opening night was a triumph. The musical then played for four weeks at the Erlanger Theatre in Philadelphia, beginning on February 15, 1956.\nIt premiered on Broadway March 15, 1956, at the Mark Hellinger Theatre in New York City. It transferred to the Broadhurst Theatre and then The Broadway Theatre, where it closed on September 29, 1962 after 2,717 performances, a record at the time. In addition to stars Rex Harrison, Julie Andrews and Stanley\nHolloway, the original cast included Robert Coote, Cathleen Nesbitt, John Michael King, and Reid Shelton. Edward Mulhare and Sally Ann Howes replaced Harrison and Andrews later in the run. The Original Cast Recording went on to become the best-selling album in the country in both 1957 and 1958. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_fair_lady#Original_Broadway_Production&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_fair_lady#Original_Broadway_Production&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nStarring Rex Harrison,\nJulie Andrews,\nStanley Holloway,\nRobert Coote,\nMichael King,\nRod McLennan\n\nMy Fair Lady\nRecorded 30th March, 1956, at the CBS 30th Street Studios, New York City\nThis CD 1988\n\n01  Orchestra; R.
