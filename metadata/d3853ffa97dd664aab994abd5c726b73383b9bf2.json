She rose to prominence in the late 1960s as the lead singer of Big Brother and the Holding Company and later as a solo artist. Rolling Stone magazine ranked Joplin number 46 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time in 2004,[1] and number 28 on its 2008 list of 100 Greatest Singers of All Time. \n\n\n\n\nThe Woodstock Experience 2009\n\n\nThe Woodstock Experience is a box consisting of a set of studio albums and live performances from the 1969 Woodstock Festival by the artists Santana, Janis Joplin, Sly &amp; the Family Stone, Jefferson Airplane, and Johnny Winter. Each set consists of the 1969 studio album by the artist as well as each artist's entire Woodstock performance. The set was released as both a box containing all five artists, and also as individual releases separated by artist, each containing the studio album and live performance of that artist.\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nDisc 1 (I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama! \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Try (Just a Little Bit Harder)&quot; (Jerry Ragovoy, Chip Taylor) - 3:57\n2.\t&quot;Maybe&quot; (Richard Barrett) - 3:41\n3.\t&quot;One Good Man&quot; (Janis Joplin) - 4:12\n4.\t&quot;As Good As You've Been to This World&quot; (Nick Gravenites) - 5:27\n5.\t&quot;To Love Somebody&quot; (Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb) - 5:14\n6.\t&quot;Kozmic Blues&quot; (Janis Joplin, Gabriel Mekler) - 4:24\n7.\t&quot;Little Girl Blue&quot; (Lorenz Hart, Richard Rodgers) - 3:51\n8.\t&quot;Work Me, Lord&quot; (Nick Gravenites) - 6:45\n\n\n\n\nDisc 2 (Janis Joplin Live at Woodstock) \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Raise Your Hand&quot; (Eddie Floyd, Steve Cropper, Alvertis Isbell) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:31\n2.\t&quot;As Good as You've Been to This World&quot; (Nick Gravenites) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:25\n3.\t&quot;To Love Somebody&quot; (Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:16\n4.\t&quot;Summertime&quot; (George Gershwin) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:05\n5.\t&quot;Try (Just a Little Bit Harder)&quot; (Jerry Ragovoy, Chip Taylor) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:13\n6.\t&quot;Kozmic Blues&quot; (Janis Joplin, Gabriel Mekler) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:56\n7.\t&quot;Can't Turn You Loose&quot; (Otis Redding) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25\n8.\t&quot;Work Me, Lord&quot; (Gravenites) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:42\n9.\t&quot;Piece of My Heart&quot; (Ragovoy, Bert Berns) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:57\n10.\t&quot;Ball and Chain&quot; (Big Mama Thornton) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:42\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3853ffa97dd664aab994abd5c726b73383b9bf2","amp;dn":"Janis+Joplin+-+The+Woodstock+Experience+2009+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3853ffa97dd664aab994abd5c726b73383b9bf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,133,63,250,151,221,102,74,171,153,74,189,92,114,107,115,56,59,155,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
