It also has film noir elements: \nA whodunit murder mystery, with clues and detective work. \nPsychological obsessions and family conflicts. \nA dark, tragic atmosphere. \n\nLively Western with a film noir whodunit plot and support for democracy and rule of law.\n\nFeeling responsible for his father's death, marshal Kirk Douglas seeks redemption. He gets his chance when he saves murder suspect Walter Brennan from a lynch mob.\n\nThe grateful Brennan accompanies Douglas to another town, where he can get a fair trial. \n\nThough found guilty, Brennan is rescued when Douglas nails the real killer. Along the Great Divide was Kirk Douglas' first western (he'd been rejected for the Montgomery Clift role in Red River)--and, need one add, hardly the last.\n\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.49gb\nDuration.... 01:24:10\nCodec.... h264\nVideo Tracks...
