A bright green dessert and a seafood snack must be worked into the competitors' appetizers. Then in the entree round, the chefs must contend with quinoa and sour candy. And with one more chance to redeem themselves, the two finalists fight to the end, as they make desserts from palm seeds and dulce de leche.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 25-Feb-2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87c79f1f604184e6755316309ffd0626289ff75d","amp;dn":"Chopped.S19E02.Return.and.Redeem.PDTV.x264-JIVE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87c79f1f604184e6755316309ffd0626289ff75d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,199,159,31,96,65,132,230,117,83,22,48,159,253,6,38,40,159,247,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
