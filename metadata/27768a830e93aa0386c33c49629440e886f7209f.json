Catherine Everley, a starry-eyed optimist, dreams of marrying a handsome Prince Charming. But first she must find a husband for Elizabeth.\n\nEach of two noble brothers believes the other should take a wife: John Vernon, the Marquess of Wykham, is a solemn gentleman; his younger brother, Richard, is lively and outrageous. When Catherine picks John as her sister's perfect match, it is just the beginning of a wild romp of mistaken intentions and matchmaking schemes gone scandalously, hilariously awry. At the end of &quot;this&quot; unforgettable Season, there will indeed be a wedding -- but who exactly will marry whom?\n\nGenre: Romance, Historical Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27768a830e93aa0386c33c49629440e886f7209f","amp;dn":"Wedding+of+the+Year+by+Victoria+Malvey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27768a830e93aa0386c33c49629440e886f7209f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,118,138,131,14,147,170,3,134,195,60,73,98,148,64,232,134,247,32,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
