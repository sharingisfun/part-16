His 1956 top ten hit with his Blue Caps, &quot;Be-Bop-A-Lula&quot;, is considered a significant early example of rockabilly. He is a member of the Rock and Roll and Rockabilly Halls of Fame\n\n\nThis excellent Gene Vincent best-of is programmed to split the difference between his wildest rockabilly performances (the over the top &quot;B-I-Bickey-Bi, Bo-Bo-Go&quot;) and his stabs at commercially calculated teen pop (&quot;Wear My Ring&quot;). Through it all, Vincent gets impeccable backing from the Blue Caps, a fierce and precise outfit.\n\nAxeman Cliff Gallup deserves his legendary status for his litany of notes on &quot;Race With the Devil&quot; alone. Drummer Dickie Harrell is unable to contain his abandon. 15 years old and given to spontaneous fits of screaming (check out his outbursts on &quot;Be-Bop-a-Lula&quot;), he brought an extra dose of anarchy to the band. To hear just how good they were, pay special attention to the previously unreleased backing track for &quot;Rocky Road Blues.&quot;\n\nTRACKLIST\n01: Be-Bop-A-Lula [1957]\n02: Woman Love [1956]\n03: Race With The Devil [1956]\n04: Gonna Back Up Baby [1956]\n05: Bluejean Bop [1956]\n06: Important Words [1957]\n07: Crazy Legs [1957]\n08: B-I-Bickey-Bi, Bo-Bo-Go [1957]\n09: Five Days, Five Days [1957]\n10: Lotta Lovin' [1957]\n11: Wear My Ring [1957]\n12: Dance To The Bop [1957]\n13: I Git It [1958]\n14: I Got A Baby [1958]\n15: Walkin' Home From School [1958]\n16: Baby Blue [1958]\n17: True To You [1957]\n18: Rocky Road Blues [1958]\n19: Git It [1958]\n20: Say Mama [1958]\n21: Rocky Road Blues (backing track)(prev unreleased)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e3716d56fdffdba9a4b3a5765a283bf46782be4","amp;dn":"Gene+Vincent+Capitol+Collectors+Series%28rock%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e3716d56fdffdba9a4b3a5765a283bf46782be4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,55,22,213,111,223,253,186,154,75,58,87,101,162,131,191,70,120,43,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
