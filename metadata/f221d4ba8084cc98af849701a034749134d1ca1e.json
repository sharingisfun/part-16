Maurice Chevalier is a highborn Sylvanian diplomat called back to his country due to his amorous escapades. It is arranged for Chevalier to marry MacDonald, but though he is ostensibly the &quot;king&quot; of the boudoir, he is not allowed to participate in any affairs of state. Gradually the royal protocol erodes the marriage, as the formerly footloose Chevalier bristles at being a mere consort. After numerous complications and misunderstandings, Chevalier asserts his authority over the secretly willing MacDonald. Counterpointing the main plot is the backstairs romance of servants Lupino Lane and Lillian Roth, who, like the stars, get to cut loose in the occasional musical number. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020112/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020112/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nSubtitles:\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-20112/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-20112/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nDirector: Ernst Lubitsch\n\n\n\n\n\tMaurice Chevalier... \tCount Alfred Renard\n\n\tJeanette MacDonald... \tQueen Louise\n\tLupino Lane\t... \tJacques\n\tLillian Roth\t... \tLulu\n\tEugene Pallette\t... \tMinister of War\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:46:41\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480  4:3\nCodec : DivX 5\nFPS : 29,97\nBitRate : 1214 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,14 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f221d4ba8084cc98af849701a034749134d1ca1e","amp;dn":"The+Love+Parade+%281929%29+Maurice+Chevalier%2CJeanette+MacDonald+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f221d4ba8084cc98af849701a034749134d1ca1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,33,212,186,128,132,204,152,175,132,151,1,160,52,116,145,52,209,202,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
