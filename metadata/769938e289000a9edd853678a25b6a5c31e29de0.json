Windows server administrators manage file and print servers, network infrastructure servers, Web servers, and IT application servers.\n\nThey use graphical administration tools as their primary interface but also use Windows PowerShell commandlets and occasionally write Windows PowerShell scripts for routine tasks and bulk operations. They conduct most server management tasks remotely by using Terminal Server or administration tools installed on their local workstation.\n\nCovering every aspect of Windows Server 2008 R2 in nine chapters and approximately 200 pages is clearly an impossible task. Rather than try to cover everything, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve focused on what is new and important, while giving you the context from Windows Server 2008.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:769938e289000a9edd853678a25b6a5c31e29de0","amp;dn":"Introducing+Windows+Server+2008+R2+%282010%29+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"769938e289000a9edd853678a25b6a5c31e29de0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,153,56,226,137,0,10,158,221,133,54,120,162,91,106,92,49,226,157,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
