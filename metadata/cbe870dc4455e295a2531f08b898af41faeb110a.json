Originally broadcast just before Christmas in 1970 as part of the series Play for Today (and rebroadcast due a signal drop in some areas), this chilly little number from the BBC archives is a folk-laced tale of paganism and terror in the countryside made three years before The Wicker Man, with which it shares a number of striking similarities\nNorah Palmer (Anna Cropper) is a television script editor who temporarily moves to a remote English country village to rebuild her life. At first, she finds that the villagers are friendly, if a little eccentric. When she becomes pregnant to the handsome villager Rob, she begins to suspect the locals of conspiring against her, preventing her from leaving the village for her home in London.\n\nWith its combination of unsettling folk rituals and insular regional communities, Robin Redbreast is considered to be an influence and precursor to The Wicker Man (1973), and has built up a cult following over the years since its original broadcast. Made during the golden age of British TV drama, and originally shown in the Play for Today strand, this provocative and unsettling drama was directed by the renowned producer / director James McTaggart from a script by John Bowen.\n\nIn line with what was then common policy regarding archived material, the BBCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original colour broadcast tape reels of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Robin RedbreastÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ were wiped clean for future reuse on other taped productions, and only recently was this faded black-and-white 16mm telerecording -- originally made for the purposes of overseas sales -- unexpectedly unearthed (like one of the vestigial Ã¢â‚¬ËœsherdsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ the playÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sinister amateur archaeologist and village folklorist Mr Fisher seeks to liberate from their bucolic resting places amidst the Vale of EveshamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most verdant countryside), thus allowing an atmospheric gem to wend its way back into public consciousness after forty-three years -- just as the British horror genre begins once more to take an interest in and to celebrate its relationship with this unique strain of a precious cinematic past.\n\nPerhaps this new appreciation of the pastoral delights of the folk traditions essential to a certain strain of British horror film from the 60s and 70s is a reaction to increasingly changeable and unpredictable times: for here, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe old waysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ are intangibly but indelibly always present, a comfort of sorts even in the midst of a culture of disposability which pits the urban attractions of secular modernity (the hard-won emancipation of feminine sexuality in particular) against the keepers of a more traditional set of values for whom rural fertility rites, dormant superstitions and fragments of half-forgotten ancient ritual are seen as pivotal to the preservation of a spiritual relationship with the landscape of old Albion, and to the maintenance of its very identity.\n\nDirector: James MacTaggart \nWriter: John Bowen \nStars: Anna Cropper, Amanda Walker, Julian Holloway\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.23gb\nDuration.... 01:16:25\nCodec.... h264\nFrame Width..... 688\nFrame Height.... 512\nData Rate.... 2190kbps\nFrame Rate.... 25F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 123kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbe870dc4455e295a2531f08b898af41faeb110a","amp;dn":"Robin+Redbreast+1970+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbe870dc4455e295a2531f08b898af41faeb110a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,232,112,220,68,85,226,149,162,83,31,8,184,152,175,65,250,235,17,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
