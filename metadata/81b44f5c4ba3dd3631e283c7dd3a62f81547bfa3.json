They recorded 3 albums: Cathedral Of Love, 3-fold Lotus and Execution Revolution. All albums have been out of print since the early 1990s. I will make a torrent for the 3-fold Lotus EP if enough of you request it.\n\nMembers:\n\nOctober - vocals\nDavid Lootz - bass, backing vocals (some lead vocals on Cathedral Of Love album)\nGary &quot;the hypnotist&quot; Shefler - guitar\nEddie The Drummer - drums, backing vocals\n\nEXTREMELY RARE and very cool music from the 1980s.  \n\nPlease SEED to at least a 1:1 ratio. In other words, keep this torrent alive by giving back 100% of what you take from others. :) \n\nEnjoy!\n\t\t\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81b44f5c4ba3dd3631e283c7dd3a62f81547bfa3","amp;dn":"RARE+80s+Post-Punk+Dark+Wave+-Trance+Logic+%282+albums%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81b44f5c4ba3dd3631e283c7dd3a62f81547bfa3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,180,79,92,75,163,221,54,49,226,131,199,221,58,98,248,21,71,191,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
