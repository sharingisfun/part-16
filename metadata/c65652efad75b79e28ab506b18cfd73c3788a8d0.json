The relationship between the train and the people is changing, however, as a new generation of Gurkhas populates these hills, demanding an independent state and fighting for a new identity as they journey into the modern Indian world.\r\n\r\n2)  The Nilgiri Mountain Railway \r\nThe Nilgiri Mountain Railway is a romantic line, popular with honeymooners and driven by love and devotion as well as steam. It chugs through the south Indian jungle up to a hill station, once known as Snooty Ooty. The current guard is Ivan. Married for twenty years, he is concerned about his friend Jenni, the ticket inspector, because he's still a bachelor - but Jenni has a secret. In the engine shed, Shivani, the railway's first female diesel engineer, is working on a steam loco. She has to make it look its best, as in the year of filming, 1999, the railway celebrated its centenary. The high point is the Black Beauty competition to pick the best engine on the line, but rains and landslides threaten the proceedings and the tourist business. Will love win out in the end?\r\n\r\n3)  The Kalka-Shimla Railway \r\nShimla was once the summer capital of the Raj. They built churches, schools, a town hall and the railway and left behind their symbols of empire and an ethos of duty, loyalty and ambition - but they also left a divided subcontinent. Characters featured include Maqsood, a refugee and a porter from Kashmir, and John Whitmarsh-Knight, a teacher looking for a home. Sanjay the station master is hoping for promotion and his boss Bataljit is waiting for a transfer, but everybody is waiting for the snow.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/54/Indian-Hill-Railways-BBC-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3e/Indian-Hill-Railways-BBC-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6c/Indian-Hill-Railways-BBC-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/24/Indian-Hill-Railways-BBC-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/01/Indian-Hill-Railways-BBC-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Indian-Hill-Railways-BBC-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/24/Indian-Hill-Railways-BBC-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/15/Indian-Hill-Railways-BBC-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d8/Indian-Hill-Railways-BBC-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f8/Indian-Hill-Railways-BBC-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e3/Indian-Hill-Railways-BBC-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8f/Indian-Hill-Railways-BBC-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 19 (~3274Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 1.41 GB (average)\r\n * Source: HDTV (upscaled)\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00qzk9r","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c65652efad75b79e28ab506b18cfd73c3788a8d0","amp;dn":"BBC+Indian+Hill+Railways+3of3+The+Kalka-Shimla+Railway+720p+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c65652efad75b79e28ab506b18cfd73c3788a8d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,86,82,239,173,117,183,158,40,171,80,107,24,207,215,60,55,136,168,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
