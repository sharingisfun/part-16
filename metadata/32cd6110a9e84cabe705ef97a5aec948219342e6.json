The book focuses on process safety issues in the design of chemical, petrochemical, and hydrocarbon processing facilities. It discusses how to select designs that can prevent or mitigate the release of flammable or toxic materials, which could lead to a fire, explosion, or environmental damage.\r\nKey areas to be enhanced in the new edition include inherently safer design, specifically concepts for design of inherently safer unit operations and Safety Instrumented Systems and Layer of Protection Analysis. This book also provides an extensive bibliography to related publications and topic-specific information, as well as key information on failure modes and potential design solutions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32cd6110a9e84cabe705ef97a5aec948219342e6","amp;dn":"Guidelines+for+Engineering+Design+for+Process+Safety+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32cd6110a9e84cabe705ef97a5aec948219342e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,205,97,16,169,232,76,171,231,5,239,151,165,174,201,72,33,147,66,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
