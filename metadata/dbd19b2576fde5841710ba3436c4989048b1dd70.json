It seems to be the only environment in which he excels. However, being a champion Trident Starfighter isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t something you want to brag about in public nor will it help earn a scholarship.\n\nBut as soon as Austin is about to give up on college he reaches the top of the elite server. He receives an invitation from a school shrouded in secrecy promising to unlock his hidden potential. With no other options, Austin takes the offer.\n\nWhat Austin doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t realize is that his dream of going to college has just opened up the cosmos and will challenge everything Austin thinks he knows about himself and the universe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbd19b2576fde5841710ba3436c4989048b1dd70","amp;dn":"L.E.+Thomas+-+Star+Runners+%28Star+Runners+%231%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbd19b2576fde5841710ba3436c4989048b1dd70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,209,155,37,118,253,229,132,23,16,186,52,54,196,152,144,72,177,221,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
