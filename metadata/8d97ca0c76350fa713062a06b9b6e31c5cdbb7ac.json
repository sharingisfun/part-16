Thus, their audience has always been relatively compact. Yet thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no denying that their fans are fiercely committed. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve sold out the Royal Albert Hall. Four times.\nIt would be very easy for Show of Hands to simply coast on this loyalty. Instead, they have deliberately evolved to challenge their audience. In 2004 they augmented the group with double-bass player Miranda Sykes, and with 2009Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s album, Arrogance, Ignorance and Greed, they stripped back the Show of Hands sound, evoking a politicised post-folk, pre-punk grittiness.\nWake the Union has its fair share of overtly political moments. The cleverest one, and the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s overall highlight, is Aunt Maria, featuring slide guitar from Martin Simpson.\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about the titular Aunt meeting song collector Cecil Sharp. Maria allows her song to be recorded and her history told, but is uneasy about the difference in class between herself and Sharp, and anxious that she shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be the only one to whom the collector talks. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lots more folk like me, sir,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Knightly sings as Maria. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Why donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you come and see, sir?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s another notable guest star: Seth Lakeman. He pops up on a few songs, including a co-write on the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s paean to stalkers, Haunt You, and he also totes his viola on the (rather pointless) cover of Bob DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Seven Curses.\nMore successful is SykesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ vocal contribution to Coming Home. She interjects two verses from the traditional song, Bonny Light Horseman, subtly complicating this otherwise simple tale of a familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bad seed.\nThere are certainly a few filler tracks, but overall this is a solid, sometimes great, set. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unlikely to win over many new fans, but those already under the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wingspan are, once again, richly rewarded with another thought-provoking collection.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/24/show-of-hands/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/24/show-of-hands/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d97ca0c76350fa713062a06b9b6e31c5cdbb7ac","amp;dn":"Show+Of+Hands+-+Wake+the+Union+%5B2012%5D+%5B%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d97ca0c76350fa713062a06b9b6e31c5cdbb7ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,151,202,12,118,53,15,167,19,6,42,6,185,182,227,28,92,219,183,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
