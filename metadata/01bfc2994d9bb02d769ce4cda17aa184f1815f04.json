The Welsh duo - Sarah Howells and Richard Llewellyn - have been making serious waves around the UK, touring constantly since getting together in 2009.\n\nLast year alone they played over one hundred dates, selling out venues across the UK and performing at a host of prominent music festivals. The long-awaited new album is their first release on the Navigator label.\n\n\nMusically, Sarah and Richard are inspired by the likes of Laura Veirs, Bjork, Jeff Buckley, Gillian Welch, Everything but the Girl and Lucinda Williams. Ã¢â‚¬ËœLittle LettersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a step away from their previous two albums, with more of a full band feel that nevertheless maintains the duoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s talent for catchy, atmospheric, folk-tinged songs. Their compositions are picturesque stories, inspired by their rural upbringing and the emotional extremes of past loves and friendships.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01bfc2994d9bb02d769ce4cda17aa184f1815f04","amp;dn":"Paper+Aeroplanes+-+Little+Letters+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.FLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01bfc2994d9bb02d769ce4cda17aa184f1815f04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,191,194,153,77,155,176,45,118,156,228,205,161,122,161,132,241,129,95,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
