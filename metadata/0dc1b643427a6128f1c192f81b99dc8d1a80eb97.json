Since dynamic loading problems are very difficult as compared to their static counterpart, relatively little is known about dynamic behavior of heterogeneous materials and structures.\n\nTopics covered include the response of metallic, ceramic as well as polymeric composite materials to blast and shock loadings, impact loadings and failure of novel materials under more controlled dynamic loads. These include response of soft materials that are important in numerous applications but have very limited information available on their dynamic response. The topics of dynamic fracture and fragmentation that have reemerged in recent years have also been included. Both experimental as well as numerical aspects of material and structural response to dynamic loads are discussed.\n\nWritten by several key experts in the field, Dynamic Failure of Materials and Structures will appeal to graduate students and researchers studying dynamic loadings within aerospace, mechanical and civil engineering, as well as in physics and materials science.\n\n \n\n \nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 415 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1 edition (November 5, 2009)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 144190445X\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1441904454","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dc1b643427a6128f1c192f81b99dc8d1a80eb97","amp;dn":"Dynamic+Failure+of+Materials+and+Structures%2C+1st+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dc1b643427a6128f1c192f81b99dc8d1a80eb97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,193,182,67,66,122,97,40,241,193,146,248,27,153,220,141,26,128,235,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
