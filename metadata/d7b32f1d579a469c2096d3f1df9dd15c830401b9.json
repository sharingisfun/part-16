Their cause becomes even more desperate following an incredible attack by an undetermined assailant possessing extraordinary abilities. The shocking attack renews the political and public outcry for both a Mutant Registration Act, and an anti-mutant movement, now led by William Stryker. A vocal, wealthy, former commander for the Army, Stryker, is rumored to have experimented on mutants. Stryker's dubious mutant &quot;work&quot; is somehow tied to Logan's/Wolverine's mysterious and forgotten past. As Logan/Wolverine searches for clues to his origin, Stryker puts into motion his anti-mutant program--launching a severe attack on Professor Xavier's mansion. Magneto, newly escaped from his plastic prison, proposes a partnership with Professor Xavier and the X-Men to combat their common and formidable enemy: Stryker. With the fates of Xavier, mankind, and mutantkind, in their hands, the X-Men face their most dangerous mission yet.\n\nDirected by \tBryan Singer\n\nProduced by \tLauren Shuler Donner\nRalph Winter\n\nScreenplay by \tMichael Dougherty\nDan Harris\nDavid Hayter\n\nStory by \tBryan Singer\nDavid Hayter\nZak Penn\n\nBased on\tX-Men \nby Jack Kirby\nStan Lee\n\nStarring:\t\nPatrick Stewart\nHugh Jackman\nIan McKellen\nHalle Berry\nFamke Janssen\nJames Marsden\nRebecca Romijn-Stamos\nBrian Cox\nAlan Cumming\nBruce Davison\nAnna Paquin\n\nMusic by \tJohn Ottman\n\nCinematography \tNewton Thomas Sigel\n\nEditing by \tJohn Ottman\nElliot Graham\n\nStudio \tMarvel Enterprises\nThe Donners' Company\nBad Hat Harry\nDistributed by \tTwentieth Century Fox\nRelease date(s) \t\n\n    May 2, 2003\n\nRunning time \t133 minutes\nCountry \tUnited States\nLanguage \tEnglish\nBudget \t$110 million\nBox office \t$407,711,549","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7b32f1d579a469c2096d3f1df9dd15c830401b9","amp;dn":"X2%3A+X-Men+United.+English.+Bluray+Rip.+2003.+MP4.+HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7b32f1d579a469c2096d3f1df9dd15c830401b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,179,47,29,87,154,70,156,32,150,211,241,223,157,209,92,131,4,1,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
