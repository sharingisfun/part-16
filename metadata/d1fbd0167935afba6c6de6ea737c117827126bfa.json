Barry, Cliff Curtis, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Macy Gray\n\nThe most dangerous criminal may be the only police officer who violates the law. Beginner-cop Jake Hoyt wants to fight criminals, not become one of them. But to stay on the other side of the line that separates the police from a gangster, it will be harder than all the other dangers of his hard life. Because the senior mentor Hoyt in the next 24 hours will be Alonzo Harris, an undercover agent, who through deceit and cruelty surpasses the most notorious criminals in Los Angeles. The role of the charming Harris has nothing to do with the images of goodies for the usual Denzel Washington. In a fierce battle with the dregs of society Harris forgets not only the law but of morality. His cruel logic &quot;to live with the wolves ...&quot; simultaneously calls and sympathy and disgust. Gradually, he becomes one of those who intended to fight. Ethan Hawke plays a rookie inexperienced Hoyt. Directed by Antoine Fuqua (&quot;The Replacement Killers,&quot; &quot;On the live-bait&quot;) perfectly manages the actor's team, which includes music stars Dr. Dre, Macy Gray and Snoop Dogg. Voltage film grows step by step, until it reaches critical mass.\n\nReleased: 2001\nIssued: Warner Bros.
