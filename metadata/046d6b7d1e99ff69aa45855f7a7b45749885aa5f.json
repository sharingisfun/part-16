As they encounter unexpected friends and foes, magic and weaponry, dragons and men, it will change the very course of their destiny. Will they finally find Guwayne? \n\nDarius and his few friends survive the massacre of their peopleÃ¢â‚¬â€but only to find that they are captives, thrown into the Empire Arena. Shackled together, facing unimaginable opponents, their only hope for survival is to stand and fight together, as brothers. \n\nGwendolyn wakes from her slumber to discover that she and the others have survived their trek across the Great WasteÃ¢â‚¬â€and even more shocking, that they have come to a land beyond their wildest imagination. As they are brought into a new royal court, the secrets Gwendolyn learns about her ancestors and her own people will change her destiny forever. \n\nErec and Alistair, still captive at sea, struggle to break free from the grips of the Empire fleet in a bold and daring nighttime escape. When odds seem at their worst, they receive an unexpected surprise that might just give them a second chance for victoryÃ¢â‚¬â€and another chance to continue their attack on the heart of the Empire. \n\nGodfrey and his crew, imprisoned once again, set to be executed, have one last chance to try to escape. After being betrayed, they want more than escape this timeÃ¢â‚¬â€they want vengeance. \n\nVolusia is surrounded on all sides as she strives to take and hold the Empire capitalÃ¢â‚¬â€and she will have to summon a more powerful magic than sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever known if she is to prove herself a Goddess, and become Supreme Ruler of the Empire. Once again, the fate of the Empire hangs in the balance. \n\nWith its sophisticated world-building and characterization, A DREAM OF MORTALS is an epic tale of friends and lovers, of rivals and suitors, of knights and dragons, of intrigues and political machinations, of coming of age, of broken hearts, of deception, ambition and betrayal. It is a tale of honor and courage, of fate and destiny, of sorcery. It is a fantasy that brings us into a world we will never forget, and which will appeal to all ages and genders.
