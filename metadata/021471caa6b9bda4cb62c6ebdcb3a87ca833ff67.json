This is at once the main virtue, and principal problem with the freshfaced Liverpudlian's debut album. His co-writer, David Hughes, and the rest of the band, pay due respect to Lang's precocious talent, surrounding the voice with spacious, haunted atmospherics. A piano picks out arcane melodies. Clarinets and saxophones coil round fretless bass lines, and the torchy voice luxuriates in the spotlight.\nOn Fingers and Thumbs, Scallywag Jaz, and Injury , the result is an eerie, late-night jazziness which turns its nose up at the MOR slush potential of Thomas' voice, but which defies easy assimilation. The presence of his earlier single The Happy Man proves that Lang can, if he wishes, turn out the most sublime linear pop melodies, but here, even the cover version of Me And Mrs Jones seems more interested in unpicking the seams of the original.\n\nSleep With Me, and Boys Prefer swing lazily towards a hazy nostalgia for half-empty '50s ballrooms, and Shoe Laces offers a brassy reprise on the theme of Mrs Jones , but these are songs which shine or slump according to the merits of Lang's voice. For all its misty sophistication, thoug, 'Scallywag Jaz' is a brilliantly skittish beginning.\n\nScallywag Jaz\nBreathless\nHeaven\nOut Of Reach\nMe &amp; Mrs Jones\nShoelaces (Mrs. Jones Pt.2)\nBoys Prefer\nThe Happy Man\nSpirit\nSons Of\nSleep With Me\nStrength\nThe Longest Song\nFingers &amp; Thumbs\nInjury\n(From Russia With Love)...\n...Little Moscow\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:021471caa6b9bda4cb62c6ebdcb3a87ca833ff67","amp;dn":"Thomas+Lang+-+Scallywag+Jaz+and+More+%28320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"021471caa6b9bda4cb62c6ebdcb3a87ca833ff67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,20,113,202,166,185,189,164,203,98,198,235,220,179,168,124,168,51,255,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
