Under the influence\n\nBeyond the hysteria of Reefer Madness and past the deceptive lessons of &quot;Just Say No&quot;, HIGH exposes the true story of America's war on drugs. Using government statistics, expert interviews and a large dose of humor, HIGH takes a fresh look at this hot button issue and asks just how much this &quot;war&quot; costs Americans in money, stress, and even lives. There's a violent drug treatment program that tortured children; an overbearing drug czar that doesn't care for the people he hurts in his quest; patients who are being denied the medications they need; doctors being prosecuted for trying to help them; and a substance that we all know of, but nobody wants to talk about.\n\nHIGH - DVD Rip.avi\n\nDocumentary\n\nLenght:01:26:34\nSize:  700MB (734017536 bytes)\nVideo: XVID 608x352 29.97fps [Stream 00]\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo 192Kbps [Stream 01]\n\nA big thank you to the unknown ripper\n\n\nEnjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61ef6cdf03ead7880dc1ac634ff8f69302a210bb","amp;dn":"HIGH+-+The+True+Tale+of+American+Marijuana.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61ef6cdf03ead7880dc1ac634ff8f69302a210bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,239,108,223,3,234,215,136,13,193,172,99,79,248,246,147,2,162,16,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
