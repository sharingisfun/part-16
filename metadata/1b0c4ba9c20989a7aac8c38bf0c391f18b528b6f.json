It was created by members of the JXTA community, sharing their real-world experience to introduce developers to JXTA.It starts with the fundamentals of P2P and demonstrates how JXTA fulfills the P2P promise, then covers the essentials of JXTA including the protocols, the JXTA Shell, and groups. Later chapters include case studies demonstrating JXTA to synchronize data and to create distributed applications.Includes a foreward by Juan Carlos Soto, Group Marketing Manager for Project JXTA at Sun Microsystems and the jxta.org Open Source Community Manager.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b0c4ba9c20989a7aac8c38bf0c391f18b528b6f","amp;dn":"JXTA%3A+Java+P2P+Programming","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b0c4ba9c20989a7aac8c38bf0c391f18b528b6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,12,75,169,194,9,137,167,170,200,195,139,240,195,145,241,139,82,139,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
