He has even been voted best guitarplayer of the world once by Rolling Stones Magazine. While most of his solowork lacks good compositions and most tunes are more or less constructed around a good lick or groove, on this album Akkerman shows that he in fact can compose a bit and the guiterwork is just outstanding. Get it and be surprised! \n\nBrought to you by TQMP. (The Quality Music Project) \n\nIn this project me and my fellow pirates share only quality items out of our CD collections in lossless FLAC and include covers, especially for those who like to burn and print and put it in a nice and shiny jewelcase. Well, you all know the drill :) \n\nRipped by Exact Audio Copy V0.99 from 01-23-2008. Encoded to FLAC with 1024kb/s \nGet Your Free Copy of the EAC and FLAC suite at:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.exactaudiocopy.de/en/index.php/resources/download/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.exactaudiocopy.de/en/index.php/resources/download/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease feel free to join the TQMP project! \nThe &quot;rules&quot; are simple: Rip your CD (no 1980's cassettetapes or vinylrips please!) in lossless format AND include artwork.
