Some of these biases are based on traditional teachings, and others\nstem from differences reflected in the body of literature accumulated in each specialty.\nOften, what is well known and accepted in one specialty must be ÃƒÂ¢??ÃƒÂ¢??rediscoveredÃƒÂ¢??ÃƒÂ¢?? independently\nby another before becoming part of practice standards (perhaps the most obvious\nexample is the variety of approaches to management of the difficult airway). For these\nreasons, to the extent possible, we have paired contributors from different specialty backgrounds\nas author teams, e.g., a surgeon with an anesthesiologist or an emergency medicine\nphysician with a surgeon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39560df83a1316d3714f9ad0d72e236db827a6f6","amp;dn":"Prehospital+Trauma+Care+ITACCS+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39560df83a1316d3714f9ad0d72e236db827a6f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,86,13,248,58,19,22,211,113,79,154,208,215,46,35,109,184,39,166,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
