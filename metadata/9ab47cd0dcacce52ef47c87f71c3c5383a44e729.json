New to town, Beatrice is expecting her new best friend to be one of the girls she meets on the first day. But instead, the alphabet conspires to seat her next to Jonah, aka Ghost Boy, a quiet loner who hasn't made a new friend since third grade. Something about him, though, gets to Bea, and soon they form an unexpected friendship. It's not romance, exactly - but it's definitely love. Still, Bea can't quite dispel Jonah's gloom and doom - and as she finds out his family history, she understands why. Can Bea help Jonah? Or is he destined to vanish?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ab47cd0dcacce52ef47c87f71c3c5383a44e729","amp;dn":"Natalie+Standiford%2C+How+to+Say+Goodbye+in+Robot+YA+epub+%5Bdovah%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ab47cd0dcacce52ef47c87f71c3c5383a44e729","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,180,124,208,220,172,206,82,239,71,200,127,113,195,197,56,58,68,231,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
