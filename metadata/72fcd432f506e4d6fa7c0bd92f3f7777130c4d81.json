Imagine a yacht, the kind where polite people welcome you to the party as if they were happy to see you. Then glance around the deck and see people like Dj Dan, Hernan Cattaneo, John Graham, Nick Warren hanging out, catching up on things. Eating a prime rib dinner, making as many trips to the open bar as you wanted. Oh, and sailing across Miami with a bunch of your favorite people, who you havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t seen since the last party, while Sasha and John play the perfect, sexy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbackyardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ set of the year. Throw a circle of good energy around the enterprise and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s suddenly like maybe there really is a reason to believe in Santa Claus. Because this party, if you are lucky enough to be there, is the ultimate gift.\n\nEven more to the point, it is probably the last of the Miami traditions left standing. The Masters at Work Party, Danny at Space, all are barely memories now. But the boat party, which began back in the days before the dot com boom had burst, is alive and well. And, for me, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s still the real reason to make the trek to Miami.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.filefactory.com/file/agbf402/n/sasha_and_john_digweed-wmc_yacht_party-26-03-2009_www_trancezone_nu_mp3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.filefactory.com/file/agbf402/n/sasha_and_john_digweed-wmc_yacht_party-26-03-2009_www_trancezone_nu_mp3&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72fcd432f506e4d6fa7c0bd92f3f7777130c4d81","amp;dn":"sasha_and_john_digweed-wmc_yacht_party-26-03-2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72fcd432f506e4d6fa7c0bd92f3f7777130c4d81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,252,212,50,245,6,228,214,250,124,11,217,47,63,119,119,19,12,77,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
