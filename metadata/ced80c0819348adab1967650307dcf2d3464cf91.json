King Lear had three daughters: Goneril, Regan and Cordelia. One day he banished and repudiated his youngest and most loved daughter. But the evil elder sisters betrayed their father and blinded him. Having lost not only his kingdom, but even a plain shelter, the old Lear, accompanied by his loyal jester, had finally seen the light of truth and was reunited with Cordelia who was not afraid to share her fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ There are Russian, English, French covers\n\nAmazon Description\n\nHailed as one of the best adaptations of this Shakespearean tragedy, Grigori KozintsevÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s KING LEAR is a striking epic interpretation based on a translation by novelist Boris Pasternak and driven by a stirring score by composer Dmitri Shostakovich. Kozintsev transposed the setting to a sparse landscape of moors and marshes, which provides an eerie backdrop to the bare castles and roaming bands of ragged, destitute wanderers. Thin, frail Yuri YarvetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unique interpretation of the title role, in which he focuses on the kingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s suffering and pain, was internationally acclaimed. Kozintsev, a peer of EisensteinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s who worked well into the 1960s, was a master of cinematic technique who finally achieved recognition at the end of his career for his stunning interpretations of Shakespeare. According to film historian Richard Dyer: &quot;Paradoxically, the two most powerful films of Shakespeare plays [Hamlet and King Lear] were made not in Great Britain but in the Soviet Union.&quot;\n\nCast\n\nYuri Yarvet, Elsa Radzinya, Galina Volchek, Valentina Shendrikova, Oleg Dal, Karl Sebris, Leonhard Merzin, Regimantas Adomaitis, Donatas Banionis, Alexei Petrenko, Yuozas Budraitis, Vladimir Yemelyanov, Alexander Vocach\n\nAwards\n\n* Grand Prize, Special Prize for Best Actor (Yuri Yarvet) at the Teheran IFF, 1972\n* Silver Hugo at the Chicago IFF, 1972\n* Gold Medal of Milan Municipality at the Milan IFF, 1973\n\nLanguage: Russian\nSubtitles: English, Russian, French, German, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Greek, Hebrew, Chinese, Arabic, Swedish\n\nFile Name:\nFile Size (in bytes): 734,035,968 bytes\nRuntime: 1:06:52\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size: 656x256 (AR: 2.563)\nFPS: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate: 1334 kb/s\nBits per Pixel: 0.318 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate: 117 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams: 1 \n\n=============================================================\n\nFile Name:\nFile Size (in bytes): 734,089,216 bytes\nRuntime: 1:04:56\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size: 608x240 (AR: 2.533)\nFPS: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate: 1379 kb/s\nBits per Pixel: 0.378 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate: 115 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams: 1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ced80c0819348adab1967650307dcf2d3464cf91","amp;dn":"King+Lear+-+Korol+Lir+-+DVDRip+XviD+-+Grigori+Kozintsev%5C%27s+%2819","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ced80c0819348adab1967650307dcf2d3464cf91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,216,12,8,25,52,138,218,177,150,118,80,48,125,207,45,52,100,207,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
