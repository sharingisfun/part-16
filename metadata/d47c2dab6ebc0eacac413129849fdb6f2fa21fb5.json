Dissatisfied with the album, Stevie scrapped a majority of these songs and recorded what we now have as &quot;Rock A Little&quot;. Through the years, many of these songs have resurfaced as newly recorded on future albums, but these are the originals. Enjoy!\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Mirror, Mirror\n2. Thousand Days\n3.
