It integrates with other Developer Magic tools, including cvd, cvstatic, cvbuild, and others, to provide an environment for developing object-oriented applications as quickly as possible. RapidApp generates C++ code, with interface classes based on the IRIS ViewKit toolkit. Its predefined interface components facilitate your use of other Developer Magic libraries such as OpenGL and Open Inventor.\nYou can use RapidApp for constructing typical desktop applications in which the user interface has a significant effect on the overall application architecture. The applications produced by RapidApp are automatically integrated into the Indigo Magic Desktop environment, making RapidApp the easiest way to take advantage of most of Silicon Graphics' interface and desktop technology.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01cee5710156a6bc080c8c0dd6cfa5f25773dc62","amp;dn":"SGI_RapidApp_v1.2_IRIX.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01cee5710156a6bc080c8c0dd6cfa5f25773dc62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,206,229,113,1,86,166,188,8,12,140,13,214,207,165,242,87,115,220,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
