It was first released in 1977. The sessions were recorded at The Who's Ramport Studios during the winter of 1976 (vocals were recorded at Pathe Marconi Studios in Paris, due to tax complications), and Roger allowed students from the local Battersea technical school to film them as an educational project. This also marked the first time that Roger had written or co-written a song since &quot;Here For More&quot; (released as the B-side of The Who's &quot;The Seeker&quot;) in 1970. Roger's original choice for producers, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, was denied.\n\nTrack listing [320k MP3]\n\n&quot;Parade&quot; (Phillip Goodhand-Tait) - 3:41 \n&quot;Single Man's Dilemma&quot; (Colin Blunstone) - 3:03 \n&quot;Avenging Annie&quot; (Pratt) - 4:32 \n&quot;The Prisoner&quot; (David Courtney/Todd/Daltrey) - 3:32 \n&quot;Leon&quot; (Phillip Goodhand-Tait) - 4:47 \n&quot;One of the Boys&quot; (Steve Gibbons) - 2:45 \n&quot;Giddy&quot; (Paul McCartney) - 4:47 \n&quot;Written on the Wind&quot; (Paul Korda) - 3:22 \n&quot;Satin And Lace&quot; (Courtney/Todd/Daltrey) - 4:06 \n&quot;Doing It All Again&quot; (Courtney/Todd/Daltrey) - 2:27 \n\nBONUS TRACKS\n\n&quot;Martyrs and Madmen&quot; (Steve Swindells) - 4:16 (recorded during these sessions but remained unreleased until 1982 compilation Best Bits) \n&quot;Treachery&quot; (Swindells) - 4:56 \n&quot;Say It Ain't So Joe&quot; (Murray Head) - 4:16 (released in place of &quot;Written On The Wind&quot; on original US LP) \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2fc51c59fba57b67e087085045dc1c1ef6543fb","amp;dn":"Roger+Daltrey+-+%5C%27One+of+the+Boys%5C%27+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2fc51c59fba57b67e087085045dc1c1ef6543fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,252,81,197,159,186,87,182,126,8,112,133,4,93,193,193,239,101,67,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
