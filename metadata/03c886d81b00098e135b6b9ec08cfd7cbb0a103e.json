In 1991, additional dialog by Moon Unit Zappa, actor Michael Rapaport and others was added. The musical portions are composed and recorded exclusively using the synclavier, used first by Zappa on parts of Boulez Conducts Zappa: The Perfect Stranger (1984) and later on most of the Grammy-award winning Jazz from Hell (1986). On this album, however, Zappa's Synclavier has more realistic sampled instrument sounds instead of previous FM synthesis.\n\nfrom http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization,_Phaze_III","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03c886d81b00098e135b6b9ec08cfd7cbb0a103e","amp;dn":"Frank+Zappa+-+1994+-+Civilization+Phaze+III","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03c886d81b00098e135b6b9ec08cfd7cbb0a103e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,200,134,216,27,0,9,142,19,91,107,158,192,140,253,124,187,10,16,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
