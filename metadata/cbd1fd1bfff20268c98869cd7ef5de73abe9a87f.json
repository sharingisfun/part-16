I definitely recommend adding this album to any collection of American folk and blues recordings. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbd1fd1bfff20268c98869cd7ef5de73abe9a87f","amp;dn":"%28VA-Folk-Gospel-Blues%29+Will+The+Circle+Be+Unbroken","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbd1fd1bfff20268c98869cd7ef5de73abe9a87f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,209,253,27,255,242,2,104,201,136,105,205,126,245,222,115,171,233,168,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
