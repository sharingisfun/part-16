The French foreign legion has left Vietnam in defeat and has something to prove. The Algerians are seeking independence. The two clash. The torture used by the French is contrasted with the Algerian's use of bombs in soda shops. A look at war as a nasty thing that harms and sullies everyone who participates in it.\n\nDirector: Gillo Pontecorvo\nWriters: Gillo Pontecorvo, Franco Solinas\nStars: Brahim Hadjadj, Jean Martin and Yacef Saadi\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058946/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058946/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIMDb Top 250 | Nominated for 3 Oscars.
