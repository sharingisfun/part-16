The files are .avi and are reasonable sound and picture quality considering they were saved from VHS recordings from the telly. You must expect a little bit of warbling on the sound and some fuzzy lines and video glitches, but nothing that spoils the enjoyment of the show!\n\nI will follow this up with series 7 and 8, but as I only have a slow Broadband connection, it will probably take a week or so before I can stop seeding this one and get on with the next ones, so I&amp;#039;m relying one someone seeding this after I have completed at least one upload. Please help, this doesn&amp;#039;t deserve to stay in obscurity!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10f04ddccf9527788964906a296e10e8224939b9","amp;dn":"onedin+line+season+6+at+last%21+ripped+from+tv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10f04ddccf9527788964906a296e10e8224939b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,240,77,220,207,149,39,120,137,100,144,106,41,110,16,232,34,73,57,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
