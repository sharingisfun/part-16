In 1989, Marc LÃƒÂ©pine mercilessly executed 14 female students at Montreal's Ãƒâ€°cole Polytechnique to become Canada's most notorious mass murderer. The following year spree killer Peter John Peters roamed from London, Ontario, to Thunder Bay, leaving a trail of bloodied bodies, broken dreams, and stolen vehicles. Both men experienced the same devastating destiny -- they embarked on homicidal rampages that shook their nation to the core.\n\nLee Mellor has gathered more than 25 of Canada's most lethal mass and spree killers into a single work. Rampage details their grisly crimes, delves into their twisted psyches, and dissects their motivations to answer the question every true crime lover yearns to know: why? If you think serial killers are dangerous, prepare for something deadlier ...\n\nAbout the Author :-\n\nLee Mellor was born in the United Kingdom and raised in southern Ontario. The author of Cold North Killers: Canadian Serial Murder, he is also a noted singer-songwriter. Currently, he is pursuing a PhD in the study of multicide and sexual violence at Concordia University, where he holds a B.A. in history.\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b92570daea4a1cb0305ea83d2001624dff922227","amp;dn":"Rampage%3A+Canadian+Mass+Murder+and+Spree+Killing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b92570daea4a1cb0305ea83d2001624dff922227","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,37,112,218,234,74,28,176,48,94,168,61,32,1,98,77,255,146,34,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
