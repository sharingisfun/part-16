It is the world's most cited interdisciplinary science journal. Most scientific journals are now highly specialized, and Nature is among the few journals (the other weekly journals Science and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences are also prominent examples) that still publish original research articles across a wide range of scientific fields. There are many fields of scientific research in which important new advances and original research are published as either articles or letters in Nature.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30c7a50f9c805342365ba85f05d06e5b9e54f997","amp;dn":"Nature+Mgazine+-+January+2011+%284+Issues%29+%28True+PDF%29+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30c7a50f9c805342365ba85f05d06e5b9e54f997","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,199,165,15,156,128,83,66,54,91,168,95,5,208,110,91,158,84,249,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
