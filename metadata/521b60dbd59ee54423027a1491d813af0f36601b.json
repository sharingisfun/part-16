Her songwriting and observation of human nature \n\nare as sharp as ever but it's the arrangements this time round that raise it to \n\nanother level such as the strings swelling under 'Due South' or the brass stabs \n\non 'This Town'. It's the detail in the characters that inhabit the songs that \n\nmake the album such a pleasure to listen to, whether it's the person who's \n\nworst punishment is to stay where they are ('This Town') or the character \n\nrunning away from their life ('Due South'). She's lost none of her fire, either: \n\n'Love's The Greatest Instrument' is fierce and driving, warning that public ire \n\nwill &quot;grab our politicians by the balls&quot;. Admittedly, there are a couple of \n\nmoments where you think &quot;hasn't she done this before&quot; - notably 'God's Got \n\nNothing On You' which has hints of both 'You Tell Me' and 'Exit Route' - but \n\nthat's easily forgiven. At this point in her career, it's almost becoming a cliche \n\nto say that this should be the album that breaks Thea Gilmore through to the \n\nmainstream, but hopefully recent radio friendly single 'You're The Radio' is \n\nthe secret weapon that finally gets the public to sit up and take notice of one \n\nof our finest songwriting talents. &quot;\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/26/thea-gilmore/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/26/thea-gilmore/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:521b60dbd59ee54423027a1491d813af0f36601b","amp;dn":"Thea+Gilmore...Murphy%5C%27s+Heart%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"521b60dbd59ee54423027a1491d813af0f36601b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,27,96,219,213,158,229,68,35,2,122,20,145,216,19,175,15,54,96,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
