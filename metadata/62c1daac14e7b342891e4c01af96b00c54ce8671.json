The image of the CD is in the ISO format.  An ISO CD image file is much like a ZIP file, but you can burn this file and it will be a perfect copy of the original disc. This disc contains the HP Director software which is needed in order to use the scanning features.\n\nThere are two simple ways to install the drivers:\n1) Burn the ISO image to a CD with any CD burning software and then install the drivers from the CD.  ImgBurn is a good free application that will do this for you (use Write mode).\n2) Extract the files from the ISO just like you would from a ZIP file. 7-Zip is a good free application that will do this for you.\n\nonce extracted or burned, run the setup.exe file to install.\n\nalso included in this release is a SFV file. the SFV is a way to verify the ISO file&amp;#039;s integrity. You will need an application like the free QuickSFV in order to check it if you believe the ISO is corrupt.\n\n-]-PCB-[-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62c1daac14e7b342891e4c01af96b00c54ce8671","amp;dn":"HP+Officejet+9100+Series+%289110%2C+9120%2C+9130%29+All-In-One+Printer+D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62c1daac14e7b342891e4c01af96b00c54ce8671","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,193,218,172,20,231,179,66,137,30,76,1,175,150,176,12,84,206,134,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
