Although his success lasted only a year and a half before his death in an airplane crash, Holly is described by critic Bruce Eder as &quot;the single most influential creative force in early rock and roll.&quot; His works and innovations inspired and influenced contemporary and later musicians, notably The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, and Eric Clapton, and exerted a profound influence on popular music. Holly was among the first group of inductees to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked Holly #13 among &quot;The Fifty Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Holly&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Holly&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview from Rolling Stone:\n\nBuddy Holly was one of the Beatles' biggest influences, a pioneer whose simple tunes and insane two-year hot streak inspired John Lennon and Paul McCartney to start writing their own songs. So it's no shock McCartney contributed to Rave On, a giant sundae of a Holly tribute album (featuring the Black Keys, Kid Rock and others) due out June 28th. What's surprising is how awesomely batshit his performance is. Over bar-band chug-a-lug, with scruffy guitars egging him on, he yowls through &quot;It's So Easy&quot; like he popped some Viagra, then set his pants on fire. Things get truly odd around the three-minute mark: The music stops while he launches into a bizarro jive-rap about how he's gonna hit the town with his lady. The chorus kicks back in, then McCartney delivers an even odder rap: &quot;By 'bout half past nine, we're gonna be down by the old juke joint, man, we're gonna be playin' them records, we're gonna be dancin', man, we're gonna have such fun.&quot; True, that.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/editors-picks/paul-mccartney-its-so-easy-20110525&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/editors-picks/paul-mccartney-its-so-easy-20110525&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
