It introduces object-oriented programming and the basics of objects in JavaScript. It has a do-it-yourself approach to writing code, because writing code is the best way to really learn a programming language; it encourages readers to type code into Firebug's console, see how it works, and experiment with it. Each chapter ends with practice questions for review. JavaScript (ECMAScript) is the language of the web browser, the third pillar in today's paradigm that considers web pages should consist of clearly distinguishable parts: content (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript). JavaScript can be used to create desktop widgets, browser and application extensions, and other pieces of software as well as web pages; a chapter is dedicated to the web browser environment including DOM, events, and AJAX tutorials, but the rest is applicable to the other environments too.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51r-0qToJUL._AA278_PIkin4,BottomRight,-26,22_AA300_SH20_OU15_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51r-0qToJUL._AA278_PIkin4,BottomRight,-26,22_AA300_SH20_OU15_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b418bdc82f8872bd1f3a48b67fb16781524d3d7b","amp;dn":"Object-Oriented+JavaScript","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b418bdc82f8872bd1f3a48b67fb16781524d3d7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,24,189,200,47,136,114,189,31,58,72,182,127,177,103,129,82,77,61,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
