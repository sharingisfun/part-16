This pack contains six scenarios which focus on modern-day passenger and freight operations on this busy route. These scenarios allow you to give a variety of traction a good run out and the passing AI traffic offers realism, variety and interest through the use of various other locomotive and rolling stock packs.\n\nIn these scenarios, we have strived for realism in all areas. For example, each scenario uses the timetable of its relevant year to create an as realistic experience as possible. This makes for particularly busy scenes between Edinburgh and Haymarket. As well as this, most trains have their time of leaving, origin and destination so you can see which train is which!\n\nRequirements\nExtra Stock \nEdinburgh to Glasgow \nDigital Traction Mk1s \nJust Trains JJA Autoballaster\nRS.com Class 37 \nRS.com Class 66\nRS.com Class 158 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8b11d0e03d3600ca58015bb9266a7dfa8ca4ebf","amp;dn":"RailWorks+-+AP19%3A+Edinburgh+to+Glasgow+Scenario+Pack+%28Modern%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8b11d0e03d3600ca58015bb9266a7dfa8ca4ebf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,177,29,14,3,211,96,12,165,128,21,187,146,102,167,223,168,202,78,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
