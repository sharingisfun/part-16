She stretches John Prine's &quot;Souvenirs&quot; to the max with Steve Gadd ably assisting by splashing the drums as deep as Bell's vocals. Her uptempo version of J.J. Cale's &quot;After Midnight&quot; is more captivating than Eric Clapton's; she oozes that Etta James sexuality while Reggie Young throws some tasty guitar into the semi-calypso groove. Bell's identity is unique on much of the material, but a couple of tunes have her paying tribute to some of her sisters. The title track, &quot;Queen of the Night,&quot; is drenched in gorgeous harmonies by the Sweet Inspirations and is pure Genya Ravan, but conversely, the cover of &quot;A Woman Left Lonely,&quot; embraced totally by Janis Joplin on Pearl, is a sweet vocal and totally alien to how Joplin ripped the song to shreds so wonderfully. It works on an entirely different level on Queen of the Night ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Bell's voice is an instrument that slips into different styles on a moment's notice. She takes the fun but silly Ringo Starr/Vini Poncia number five hit from the same year and gives it some style, then turns around with Deadric Malone's &quot;As the Years Go Passing By&quot; and delivers another brand of quality sound. Cornell Dupree's fabulous guitar leads cook in the background ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the frosting on the cake for &quot;As the Years Go Passing By.&quot; Intense and beautiful, it is the real sleeper here. While Merry Clayton was singing backup on Ringo Starr's &quot;Oh My My&quot; and ex-Black Oak Arkansas Ruby Starr would track Paul McCartney's &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed,&quot; Bell broke through her Stone the Crows image to cover a range of ideas, giving even David Clayton Thomas some respectability, taking his original &quot;Yesterday's Music&quot; to new heights with a Bonnie Bramlett-style touch of gospel. From Will Jennings to Carole Bayer Sager and Peter Allen, Bell's Queen of the Night is a stunningly marvelous mix of blues, pop, soul, and Southern rock. &quot;We Had It All&quot; builds with a smoldering tension that gives Bell a platform for her inspired phrasings. Sager must've been over the top when she first heard this version of &quot;The Other Side.&quot; This is music straight from the heart, which concludes with &quot;Trade Winds,&quot; piano, drums, and Bell's voice tapering off like the end of a great set at some intimate nightclub. This is an extraordinary creation worth pulling out when you want to appreciate a fine wine like Queen of the Night\n\n1. Cado Queen  \n2. Woman Left Lonely  \n3. Souvenirs  \n4. After Midnight  \n5.
