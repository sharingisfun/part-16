Commonly referred to as a hard rock or blues rock band, they are also considered pioneers of heavy metal and are sometimes classified as such, though they have always dubbed their music as simply &quot;rock and roll&quot;. To date they are one of the highest-grossing bands of all time.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap is the third studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released in 1976. All songs were written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young and Bon Scott.\n\nIt was originally released in Australia on Albert Productions on 20 September 1976. A modified international edition was later released on Atlantic Records on 17 December 1976. It was not released in the US until April 1981.\n\nThe album has been certified 6x platinum in the US, selling at least six million copies, becoming the third-highest selling album by AC/DC in the US after Highway to Hell (7x platinum) and Back in Black (22+).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverview:\n\n\n\nFollowing up on the preceding Australian album, 1975's T.N.T., AC/DC delivered another recording with a number of fan-favourite songs, including the title track, &quot;Squealer&quot;, &quot;Problem Child&quot; and others. Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap also contains some controversial lyrics. For example &quot;Big Balls&quot; lyrics uses double entendres, referring the title phrase to costume parties and to testicles.\n\nThe single &quot;Jailbreak&quot; preceded the album's release in Australia and the UK. After the album's release, the single for &quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot; was released in Australia in October 1976, in the UK in January 1977, and in the US in 1981 (when the album was finally released there).\n\nDirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap also led to more AC/DC appearances on Australia's Countdown music programme, following those in support of High Voltage and T.N.T. These appearances included a live performance of the album's title track, as well as a music video for &quot;Jailbreak&quot;.\n\nA song titled &quot;I'm a Rebel&quot; was recorded during this album's sessions in 1976, with music and lyrics written by Angus and Malcolm Young's older brother, Alex Young. This song was never released by AC/DC and remains in Albert Productions' vaults. German band Accept later released it as a single and named their second album after the song.\n\nAC/DC's record label at the time, Albert Productions, was not happy with the album's vocals and production. According to bassist Mark Evans, the band's manager Michael Browning told him he assumed Bon Scott would be fired as a result.\n\n\n\n\n\nBon Scott Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals\nAngus Young Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitar\nMalcolm Young Ã¢â‚¬â€œ rhythm guitar, backing vocals\nMark Evans Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar, backing vocals\nPhil Rudd Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\nGeorge Young Ã¢â‚¬â€œ production, bass guitar on &quot;There's Gonna Be Some Rockin'&quot;\nHarry Vanda Ã¢â‚¬â€œ production\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffc59d7417bc78b711296a86c9c20010e6d882ee","amp;dn":"ACDC+-+Dirty+Deeds...%5B1976%5D%5B1995%5D%5B320KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D%5BAustralian%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffc59d7417bc78b711296a86c9c20010e6d882ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,197,157,116,23,188,120,183,17,41,106,134,201,194,0,16,230,216,130,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
