Luckily, he swindles himself a job churning out a novelization of the 2025 remake of a 1963 horror classic, &quot;The Crawling Hand.&quot; Crandall tells therein of the United States, in a bid to regain global eminence, launching at last its doomed manned mission to the desolation of Mars. Three space pods with nine Americans on board travel three months, expecting to spend three years as the planet's first colonists. When a secret mission to retrieve a flesh-eating bacterium for use in bio-warfare is uncovered, mayhem ensues.\n\nOnly a lonely human arm (missing its middle finger) returns to earth, crash-landing in the vast Sonoran Desert of Arizona. The arm may hold the secret to reanimation or it may simply be an infectious killing machine. In the ensuing days, it crawls through the heartbroken wasteland of a civilization at its breaking point, economically and culturally--a dystopia of lowlife, emigration from America, and laughable lifestyle alternatives.\n\nThe Four Fingers of Death is a stunningly inventive, sometimes hilarious, monumental novel. It will delight admirers of comic masterpieces like Slaughterhouse-Five, The Crying of Lot 49, and Catch-22","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01c692de1d22eda12e476eec0eddb1184b71028d","amp;dn":"The+Four+Fingers+of+Death+by+Rick+Moody+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01c692de1d22eda12e476eec0eddb1184b71028d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,198,146,222,29,34,237,161,46,71,110,236,14,221,177,24,75,113,2,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
