As a solo artist he released several \nlandmark reggae albums and even recorded with the Rolling Stones. \nBut he was more than just a successful pop star: he was a revolutionary \nand a hero to many of Jamaica\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s poor. He spent his life as a strident campaigner \nfor civil rights and for the legalisation of marijuana. He was more militant and \npolitcal than his former band mate and his uncompromising arrogance often landed \nhim in serious trouble. For that reason, as this documentary reveals, his life could be \nas brutal as the way it ended. Grammy award winning film-maker Don Letts explores his \ncareer.\n\n\nshared by\nsean a.k.a soul rebel 24-11-2010\n\nMD5 INCLUDED\n##########################################################\nDO NOT SELL\nDO NOT CONVERT TOO MP3 UNLESS IZ FOR YOUR CAR STEREO\nDO NOT RIPP MY Stuff AND CLAIM AS IF ITS YOURS  \nDO NO NOT PAY FOR DISS (ITS FREE AS AM SHAREIN)\nDO NO NOT BOOTLEG IT  \nDO NOT IGGNOREIN ABOVE\n###########################################################\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n[Arise Black Man The Peter Tosh Story BBC Radio 4 Documentry.wav]\nDetected average hi-boundary frequency: 2.221040e+004 Hz\nDetected average lo-boundary frequency: 1.376045e+004 Hz\nDetected average hi-cut frequency: 2.302153e+004 Hz\nDetected average lo-cut frequency: 1.374219e+004 Hz\nMaximum probablis boundary frequency: 2.383600e+004 Hz\nCoefficient of nonlinearity of a phase: 5.794526e-002\nFirst order smothness: 4.688596e-001\nSecond order smothness: 6.385965e-001\n------------------------------------------------------------\nThis track looks like CDDA with probability 100%.\n\n\nNo errors occured.\n\n\nend note.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d2b1ad425587a32467a77785c0742b41e5fcf44","amp;dn":"Peter+Tosh+Arise+Black+Man+The+Story+BBC+Radio+4+Documentry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d2b1ad425587a32467a77785c0742b41e5fcf44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,43,26,212,37,88,122,50,70,122,119,120,92,7,66,180,30,95,207,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
