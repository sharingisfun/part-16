Eddy's distinctive &quot;twang&quot; guitar style complemented the infectious dance beats of his band and drove the viewers of Dick Clark's American Bandstand television show wild, even without a vocalist. This brings up the notion that perhaps pop music fans don't always require the presence of a lead singer; maybe all they look for is musical charisma, and this Eddy supplied in spades. \nHave Twangy Guitar Will  Travel was the first LP released by Eddy and his partners at Jamie Guyden Records. Recorded in 1959, this disc contains 12 rowdy rock &amp; roll classics, including &quot;Cannonball,&quot; &quot;Ramrod,&quot; &quot;The Lonely One,&quot; and &quot;Moovin' 'N' Groovin',&quot; all of which were successful singles. Other songs such as the sauntering &quot;Detour&quot; and the dark, brooding &quot;Stalkin'&quot; round out the set list nicely. A mix of early rock &amp; roll, swing, country, and blues, Have Twangy Guitar Will Travel is a great example of '50s instrumental pop. (The 40th anniversary reissue also includes three superb bonus tracks.)[/color][/quote]\n\n[color=turquoise]This album, released ten days before Christmas in 1958, stayed on the charts for more than a year - it was the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame's first album\n\n\nTracklist\n1   The Lonesome Road   3:09 \n2  I Almost Lost My Mind  2:18\n3  Rebel Rouser 2:23 \n4  Three-30-Blues  3:33 \n5 Cannonball  1:55 \n6  The Lonely One  1:42 \n7  Detour  2:12 \n8  Stalkin'  2:27 \n9 Ramrod  1:42 \n10  Anytime  2:19\n11 Moovin' 'N' Groovin 2:05\n12 Loving You   2:10 \n13  Up and Down [*]  1:58 \n14  The Walker [*]  2:01 \n15  Mason-Dixon Line [*]  1:53\n\nTracks 13-15 Bonus not on original LP\n\n\n\nPersonnel includes:[/b] Duane Eddy, Corkey Casey, Donnie Owens (guitar); The Sharps (vocals); Steve Douglas, Plas Johnson, Gil Bernal (saxophone); Al Casey (piano); Jimmy Simmons (acoustic bass); Buddy Wheeler (electric bass); Bob Taylor, Mike Bermani (drums).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b45642bd8318baf8e60ee0c0d529157eaf4aaf5e","amp;dn":"Duane+Eddy+-+Have+%5C%27Twangy%5C%27+Guitar+Will+Travel+%28rock%29%28mp3%40320%29%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b45642bd8318baf8e60ee0c0d529157eaf4aaf5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,86,66,189,131,24,186,248,230,14,224,192,213,41,21,126,175,74,175,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
