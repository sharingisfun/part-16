He is best known as\nfounder, frontman, and lead singer of the British band Ian Dury and the\nBlockheads, who were amongst the most important groups of the New Wave\nera in the UK.\n\nAs a lyricist, his authorship of popular songs of the time, in particular the single,\n&quot;Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, was underplayed at the time by critics, though it\nhas been performed and quoted by countless musicians since it was written.\n\nDr. Feelgood are a British pub rock band formed in mid 1971. The name of the\nband, Dr. Feelgood, is slang for heroin, or for doctors who are prepared to\noverprescribe drugs. In 1962 the name was originally adopted by the American\nblues pianist and singer Willie Perryman (also known as &quot;Piano Red&quot;) who\nrecorded his song &quot;Dr Feel-Good&quot; under the name &quot;Dr Feelgood &amp; The\nInterns&quot;. The song was covered by several British beat groups including\nJohnny Kidd &amp; The Pirates, who used it as the B-side to their 1964 single\n&quot;Always and Ever&quot;. It was this recording that influenced the band to adopt it as\ntheir name.\n\nCredits\n\nPresenter........Pete Drummond\nDirector........John Burrowes\nProducer.......Michael Appleton\n\n(10/12/1977)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/05517975336674527907.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/05517975336674527907.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                   : Base Media / Version 2\nCodec ID                         : mp42\nFile size                        : 661 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 1mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1493 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 3 frames\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 1329 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                  : Variable\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.128\n\n\nAudio\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AAC\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 160 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 210 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e792e377e5a484d352acdd3b472aaf142975738f","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Sight+and+Sound+in+Concert+1977+%5BMP4+-+AAC%5D+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e792e377e5a484d352acdd3b472aaf142975738f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,146,227,119,229,164,132,211,82,172,221,59,71,42,175,20,41,117,115,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
