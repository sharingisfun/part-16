Although this can be used with any aircraft in FSX/P3D/P3D v2, it is an especially good match for those that have Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A engines installed on them. Please note that this package does NOT have gear up/gear down sounds as Twin Otter has a fixed landing gear rather than a retractable one. If you need those sounds when using this package with another aircraft, you will have to add them manually by yourself. While this is generally a very good sound package, there are a few sounds that I don't like, but I decided to leave them untouched to present the package to you pirates as is.\n\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\nSimple. Open the compressed 7z file, extract ALL its content into an empty folder on your computer and read the installation instructions provided to complete the installation.\n\nSeed and enjoy, pirates!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19807dcc9c2321a95576961ce4cb3aee8bec4ef9","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%2FP3D%5D+Sonic+Solutions+-+Twin+Otter+Sound+Pack+V2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19807dcc9c2321a95576961ce4cb3aee8bec4ef9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,128,125,204,156,35,33,169,85,118,150,28,228,203,58,238,139,236,78,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
