Eddie Condon, trad jazz's chief advocate, leads a group\nof all-stars who cut their teeth on the sounds of New Orleans; Condon's\nlongtime associate Max Kaminsky does likewise. Rounding out these\nhigh-spirited proceedings are some of Great Britain's leading revivalists -\nKen Colyer, Alex Welsh, Monty Sunshine, Mr. Acker Bilk, Terry Lightfoot,\nChris Barber, and Humphrey Lyttelton. They carried teh classic jazz torch\nto the British pop charts just before the Beatles exploded.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d72ed1617b8f003a157a5381ae1f2b8f6838e1d","amp;dn":"VA-Compact+Jazz+Best+Of+Dixieland-CD-FLAC-1987-DeVOiD-JKoop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d72ed1617b8f003a157a5381ae1f2b8f6838e1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,114,237,22,23,184,240,3,161,87,165,56,26,225,242,184,246,131,142,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
