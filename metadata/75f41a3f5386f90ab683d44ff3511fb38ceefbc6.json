Records on vinyl only; a CD edition was reissued through Gnarly Geezer Records in 2001, although to this day Holdsworth claims to have received no royalties from either release. This is one of his least favourite recordings, due to numerous creative differences with executive producer Ted Templeman. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1984 for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.\n\n1. Three Sheets To The Wind\n2. Road Games\n3. Water On The Brain Pt. II\n4. Tokyo Dream\n5.
