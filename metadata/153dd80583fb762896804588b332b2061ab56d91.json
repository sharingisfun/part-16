In the days of King Henry IV, stalwart young Myles and his sister Meg have been raised as peasants, without any knowledge of who their father really was. But one day they journey to Macworth castle. There Myles falls in love with the Mackworth's daughter Anne, makes friends and enemies, and learns to be a knight so that, through the planning of Mackworth and his friend, Prince Hal, Myles can regain his true birthright from the evil Albon, and bear the black shield of Falworth.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046789/?ref_=ttpl_pl_tt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046789/?ref_=ttpl_pl_tt&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_black_shield_of_falworth&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_black_shield_of_falworth&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:153dd80583fb762896804588b332b2061ab56d91","amp;dn":"The+Black+Shield+Of+Falworth+%7B1954+Tony+Curtis+-+Subs%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"153dd80583fb762896804588b332b2061ab56d91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,61,216,5,131,251,118,40,150,128,69,136,179,50,178,6,26,181,109,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
