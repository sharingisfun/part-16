They are mainly known for their unusual amalgamation of metalcore and pop punk as a musical style, but this sometimes results in a sound similar to post-hardcore. The band consists of vocalist Jeremy McKinnon, rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Neil Westfall, bassist Joshua Woodard, percussion and drummer Alex Shelnutt and lead guitarist Kevin Skaff.\n\nSigning with Indianola Records for their first album, And Their Name Was Treason, Scruggs was replaced by Shelnutt in 2006. Later that year the band recorded For Those Who Have Heart with Victory Records. They embarked on several tours of the UK and U.S. and played at several festivals, before recording and releasing Homesick. While promoting Homesick on tour, Denney was replaced by Skaff. Soon after releasing their next album, What Separates Me from You, the band went on a worldwide tour to promote it. In 2011, the band was involved in a lawsuit with Victory Records over their recording contract, which was settled in October 2013. The band released their fifth album, Common Courtesy, the same month.\nEarly years and debut album (2003Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2006)\nMain articles: Halos for Heros, Dirt for the Dead and And Their Name Was Treason\n\nAfter all playing in different groups in the Ocala music scene, singer Jeremy McKinnon, guitarists Neil Westfall and Tom Denney, bassist Joshua Woodard, and drummer Bobby Scruggs came together in 2003. Soon after, the band embarked onto playing well over 200 shows in their first year of touring, making a name for themselves, in the U.S. The band self-released an independent EP, which was sold at their live shows. They were signed to Indianola in February 2005, for which they released their debut album, And Their Name Was Treason (2005) in May that year, going on to sell over 8,000 copies. Woodard said &quot;A friend of mine said he had the AIM screenname of someone at Victory Records. I didn't believe him, but I still started communicating with the guy. We IM'ed back and forth for about six months, and it happened that we were playing [...] in a town outside of Chicago. [...] It was our first time we ever played in Illinois, yet the 50Ã¢â‚¬â€œ60 kids there were singing along to our tunes like theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been fans all their lives.&quot; Its always good when they know the music.
