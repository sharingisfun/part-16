This is a book IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll want to give to people. I could not put it down and canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait to be captured again by the next book this wonderful human being writes.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n--Beverly Donofrio, author of Astonished: A Story of Evil, Blessings, Grace, and Solace\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Not since reading Richard LlewellynÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s How Green Was My Valley fifty years ago have I felt such empathy and love through fiction for a place, a time, and a people. Sing in the Morning, Cry at Night is a book of equal power and beauty, a bittersweet tale set in early-twentieth-century Wyoming Valley, Pennsylvania, the heart and soul of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s anthracite coal-mining region, a place where Grace and GriefÃ¢â‚¬â€now, as thenÃ¢â‚¬â€walk hand in hand.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n--Sara Pritchard, author of Help Wanted: Female\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The world of Christian miners--the hard core of the anthracite mining industry in northeast Pennsylvania--is beautifully evoked by Barbara J. Taylor in this remarkable novel. I found myself drawn back to its pages, living deeply in its world as I read. The sense of place--a place I know well, as I grew up there--is vividly realized. This is a lyrical, passionate novel that will hold readers in its thrall. A first-rate debut.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n--Jay Parini, author of The Last Station\n\nAlmost everyone in town blames eight-year-old Violet Morgan for the death of her nine-year-old sister, Daisy. Sing in the Morning, Cry at Night opens on September 4, 1913, two months after the Fourth of July tragedy. Owen, the girlsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ father, Ã¢â‚¬Å“turns to drinkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and abandons his family. Their mother Grace falls victim to the seductive powers of Grief, an imagined figure who has seduced her off-and-on since childhood. Violet forms an unlikely friendship with Stanley Adamski, a motherless outcast who works in the mines as a breaker boy.\n\nDuring an unexpected blizzard, Grace goes into premature labor at home and is forced to rely on Violet, while Owen is Ã¢â‚¬Å“off being savedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ at a Billy Sunday Revival.\n\nInspired by a haunting family story, Sing in the Morning, Cry at Night blends real life incidents with fiction to show how grace can be found in the midst of tragedy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a72c6d54af0e66dbee11badda80f107c3d401237","amp;dn":"Sing+in+the+Morning%2C+Cry+at+Night+-+Barbara+J+Taylor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a72c6d54af0e66dbee11badda80f107c3d401237","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,44,109,84,175,14,102,219,238,17,186,221,168,15,16,124,61,64,18,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
