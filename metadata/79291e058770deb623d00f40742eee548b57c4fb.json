This is the RIFFTRAX version of the film. The commentary cannot be turned off.\nIf you&amp;#039;re looking for the normal version of the film, look elsewhere.\n\n!! Riffing this time are Mike Nelson and special guest Weird Al Yankovic\n\n!! Includes Rifftrax intro in AVI format\n\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rifftrax.com/donate.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rifftrax.com/donate.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis torrent was created to simplify the confusing Rifftrax syncing process. Having the riff and the film all in one AVI file or DVD is a million times more enjoyable than trying to sync everything together. Plus Disembaudio is annoying.\n\nThe makers of the original movie I don&amp;#039;t give a triceratops poop about, but the Rifftrax crew (Mike, Bill, Kevin, and all their peons) need $ to keep making these!\n\nRIFFS ONLY COST $4!!! PLEASE DONATE IF YOU ENJOY THIS RIFFTRAX!!!\n\nThanks,\nAnna\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rifftrax.com/donate.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rifftrax.com/donate.php&lt;/a&gt;\t\t\n\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\n\n720x480\nXVID AVI\n2:06:28\n938 MB\n\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\n\nEvery quarter century or so a project comes along that so perfectly unites artist and medium that one can only stand in wonder and proclaim, &quot;Wow, Sandra, when was the last time something this magical came along - quarter century or so, wasn&amp;#039;t it?&quot;\n\nSo it was with Michelangelo and marble; Paderewsky and piano; And so it is with this RiffTrax, uniting THE legendary dinosaur movie of our time and THE weirdest &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic of our time into one harmonic convergence of RiffTastic Jurassic WeirdAlistic bliss!\n\nRiffTrax would like to say, timidly and with all humility, YOU MUST GET THIS RIFFTRAX! IT&amp;#039;S WEIRD AL, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! YOU CAN FIND COPIES OF JURASSIC PARK ON BUS SEATS! Mike and Weird Al join forces on the most colossally funny RiffTrax yet!
