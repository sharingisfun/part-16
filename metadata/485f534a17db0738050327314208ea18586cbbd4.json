Later, however, she abandoned her fairy-winged, camouflaged, pink-haired image for a more romantic look, incorporating styles from the Victorian era and bright red and pink hair. Her music changed again for her later album, Opheliac, producing an angrier sound and moving from fantasy rock to an industrial sound, incorporating electronic beats and her trademark instruments, the violin and harpischord, to create a sound that she dubbed &quot;violindustrial&quot; and &quot;Victoriandustrial&quot;.\n\nIn the past, Autumn was signed to a major label, but as they took more and more control over her work, she left and formed her own record label, Traitor Records. She currently has a distribution deal with Trisol Music Group GmbH and is touring with material from Opheliac and &quot;4 o&amp;#039;Clock&quot;. In the past, she has toured with Courtney Love and recorded backup vocals and the violin for Love and Billy Corgan. Autumn also has her own company, WillowTechHouse, which sells clothing and accessories, however it has been closed for some time. WillowTechHouse was also where Emilie&amp;#039;s own perfume, Mistress, was sold.\n\n\nEnchant\n1. &quot;Prologue: Across the Sky&quot; - 5:10\n2. &quot;How Strange&quot; - 3:07\n3. &quot;Chambermaid&quot; - 3:14\n4. &quot;Rapunzel&quot; - 3:57\n5. &quot;Ever&quot; - 6:11\n6. &quot;Second Hand Faith&quot; - 4:43\n7. &quot;Juliet&quot; - 5:42\n8. &quot;Remember&quot; - 5:25\n9. &quot;Rose Red&quot; - 5:29\n10. &quot;Castle Down&quot; - 3:52\n11. &quot;Heard it All&quot; - 3:22\n12. &quot;If You Feel Better&quot; - 4:49\n13. &quot;Save You&quot; - 4:53\n14. &quot;Epilogue: What If&quot; - 4:09\n\n\nOpheliac\nDisc One\n\n1. &quot;Opheliac&quot; - 5:33\n2. &quot;Swallow&quot; - 6:15\n3. &quot;Liar&quot; - 6:01\n4. &quot;The Art of Suicide&quot; - 5:32\n5. &quot;I Want My Innocence Back&quot; - 3:48\n6. &quot;Misery Loves Company&quot; - 4:29\n7. &quot;God Help Me&quot; - 5:58\n8. &quot;Shalott&quot; - 4:04\n9. &quot;Gothic Lolita&quot; - 6:03\n10. &quot;Dead Is The New Alive&quot; - 5:05\n11. &quot;I Know Where You Sleep&quot; - 3:15\n12. &quot;Let The Record Show&quot; - 3:52\n\nDisc Two\n\n1. &quot;Dominant&quot; - 3:46\n2. &quot;306&quot; - 5:36\n3. &quot;Thank God I&amp;#039;m Pretty&quot; - 4:00\n4. &quot;Marry Me&quot; - 4:49\n5. &quot;Largo for Violin&quot; (Bach) - 4:02\n6. &quot;Poem: How To Break a Heart&quot; - 0:36\n7. &quot;Poem: Ghost&quot; - 2:25\n8. &quot;Poem: At What Point Does A Shakespeare Say&quot; - 0:32\n\n\nLaced/Unlaced\nDisc One\n\n1. &quot;La Folia&quot; (Corelli) 10:18\n2. &quot;Recercada&quot; (Ortiz) 1:43\n3. &quot;Largo&quot; (Bach) 4:02\n4. &quot;Allegro&quot; (Bach) 3:21\n5. &quot;Adagio&quot; (Leclair) 3:36\n6. &quot;Tambourin&quot; (Leclair) 1:52\n7. &quot;Willow&quot; (Emilie Autumn) 5:49\n8. &quot;Revelry&quot; (Emilie Autumn) 1:56\n9. &quot;On A Day...&quot; (Emilie Autumn) 2:30\n10. &quot;Prologue (Live)&quot; (Emilie Autumn)\n11. &quot;Sonata for Violin &amp; Basso Continuo (Live)&quot; (Loneti)\n12. &quot;Chaconne (Live)&quot; (Vitali)\n13. &quot;La Folia (Live)&quot; (Corelli)\n14. &quot;Epilogue (Live)&quot; (Emilie Autumn)\n\n\nDisc Two\n\n1. &quot;Unlaced&quot; (Emilie Autumn) - 3:26\n2. &quot;Manic Depression&quot; (Emilie Autumn) - 5:25\n3. &quot;Leech Jar&quot; (Emilie Autumn) - 4:14\n4. &quot;A Strange Device&quot; (Emilie Autumn) - 4:16\n5. &quot;A Cure&quot; (Emilie Autumn) - 3:06\n6. &quot;Syringe&quot; (Emilie Autumn) - 3:23\n7. &quot;Cold&quot; (Emilie Autumn) - 3:02\n8. &quot;Face The Wall&quot; (Emilie Autumn) - 6:50\n\n\nA Bit O&amp;#039; This &amp; That\n1. &quot;Chambermaid&quot; (Space Mix)\n2. &quot;What If&quot; (Celtic Mix)\n3. &quot;Hollow Like My Soul&quot; (M.
