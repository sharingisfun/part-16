No Way Out\n[2:02] 9. Idle Time\n[2:23] 10. Life By The Drop\n\n\nLed by the 14-year-old guitar prodigy Alex Tintinalli, this is hard, authentic blues-rock at its sublime best, played with a technical virtuosity worthy of comparison with the greats.\n\nThe phenomenally talented Tintinalli, from Kitchener, Ontario, wrote and arranged the entire record, save covers of songs by his heroes, fellow Canadian Colin James (Voodoo Thing) and the late Stevie Ray Vaughan (Life By The Drop).\n\nAlex is a truly sensational musical proposition. In a mere three-and-a-half years since picking up the guitar, he has reached an astonishing level of accomplishment in his playing and writing, that he fuses with an on-stage passion and energy which leaves audiences on their feet and open-mouthed. \n\nThis album is an example of his expert musicianship, and songwriting way beyond his years. He is ably backed up by his band: on drums is Mike Boltz, a passionate, versatile percussionist who grew up surrounded by some great musicians, as son of Charity Brown (who had 11 hit songs in the 1970's); special guest on organ is John Lee, a stalwart of the Canadian blues scene for many years (having played with Mel Brown, Matt Minglewood and the late Dutch Mason); and finally, Alex enlists his dad Leo, who is no stranger to the music scene, on bass. Leo also doubles as band manager and co-producer of the album. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd7744daf807de1fcda0871ab282585bf586b6ca","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Alex+Tintinalli+Band+-+Nothing+To+Lose","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd7744daf807de1fcda0871ab282585bf586b6ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,119,68,218,248,7,222,31,205,160,135,26,178,130,88,91,245,134,182,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
