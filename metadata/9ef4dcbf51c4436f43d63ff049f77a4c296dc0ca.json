Unlike other compilations released by Queen, Deep Cuts contains songs which are largely not as well known as Queen's hits. The album was released on March 14, 2011 as part of Queen's 40th Anniversary. Deep Cuts Volume 1 was released at the same time Queen's first five albums (Queen, Queen II, Sheer Heart Attack, A Night at the Opera, A Day at the Races) were re-released. The songs picked were all personal favorite songs that weren't hits selected by Brian May, Roger Taylor, and Taylor Hawkins (the drummer for the Foo Fighters). It's the only release to feature the complete ending of The March of The Black Queen (on Queen II it segues to Funny How Love Is) and of Ogre Battle (on Queen II it segues to The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke). The three songs Tenement Funster, Flick of the Wrist and Lily of the Valley all segue into each other just like on the original Sheer Heart Attack album.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n\n0. \t&quot;Ogre Battle&quot;   \tFreddie Mercury \t4:14\n02. \t&quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot;   \tMay, Mercury, Taylor, John Deacon \t2:13\n03. \t&quot;My Fairy King&quot;   \tFreddie Mercury \t4:08\n04. \t&quot;I'm in Love With My Car&quot;   \tRoger Taylor \t3:05\n05. \t&quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot;   \tBrian May \t3:46\n06. \t&quot;Long Away&quot;   \tMay \t3:33\n07. \t&quot;The Millionaire Waltz&quot;   \tMercury \t4:54\n08. \t&quot;'39&quot;   \tMay \t3:30\n09. \t&quot;Tenement Funster&quot;   \tTaylor \t2:46\n10. \t&quot;Flick of the Wrist&quot;   \tMercury \t3:17\n11. \t&quot;Lily of the Valley&quot;   \tMercury \t1:45\n12. \t&quot;Good Company&quot;   \tMay \t3:23\n13. \t&quot;The March of the Black Queen&quot;   \tMercury \t6:38\n14. \t&quot;In the Lap of the Gods...
