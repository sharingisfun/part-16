The primary goal of the game is to carry out a series of assassinations ordered by Al Mualim, the leader of the Assassins. To achieve this goal, the player must travel from the Brotherhood's headquarters in Masyaf, across the terrain of the Holy Land known as the Kingdom to one of three cities, Jerusalem, Acre, or Damascus, to find the Brotherhood agent in that city. There, the agent, in addition to providing a safe house, gives the player minimal knowledge about the target, and requires them to perform additional intelligence gathering missions before attempting the assassination. These missions include eavesdropping, interrogation, pickpocketing and completing tasks for informers and fellow assassins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a23919d80b4a5a3a6d2bc30e7505911a5284acc","amp;dn":"Assassin%5C%27s+Creed+%5BMULTI5%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a23919d80b4a5a3a6d2bc30e7505911a5284acc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,35,145,157,128,180,165,163,166,210,188,48,231,80,89,17,165,40,74,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
