Paramahamsa Tewari is known in the &amp;#039;free energy&amp;#039; community as one of the pioneers of over-unity energy production. His Space Power Generator is one of the early examples of electromagnetic generators that are said to produce more energy than they should - according to agreed-upon theoretical considerations. Tewari is also the originator of Space Vortex Theory, which holds that space is permeated by a non material substrate that, similar to a Bose-Einstein condensate, has high density but no inherent resistance to flow, and that matter is created by vortices in that substrate that break its continuity due to their flow at the speed of light. Can we understand the universal reality in a scientific sense and describe it through scientific methods? Taking due note of the theories and experimental findings during the last few centuries and paying attention to the fact that some basic issues like genesis of mass, inertia, charge and light require a fresh approach for their fuller understanding, universal reality can be pinpointed. Among the aforesaid basic properties of matter, genesis of mass is the least understood phenomenon. The experimental proof of the hypothesis of the substantiality of space has been subsequently obtained through the numerous experiments on a new phenomenon of &quot;space power generation&quot;. In this fascinating book its principles are derived and an exciting new model of the universe emerges. 135 pages, many pictures. A must read for everyone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a609d35c4e18dd14df7b83cd34021ca71b6296c2","amp;dn":"Tewari+-+Physics+of+Free+Power+Generation+-+Beyond+Matter+%281996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a609d35c4e18dd14df7b83cd34021ca71b6296c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,9,211,92,78,24,221,20,223,123,131,205,52,2,28,167,27,98,150,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
