Formed by former members of Deep Purple (Rod Evans, vocals), \nIron Butterfly (Rhino, lead guitar, and Lee Dorman, ... Full Descriptionbass), and \nJohnny Winter (Bobby Caldwell, drums) Captain Beyond is an album that flows from riff to riff, \ndrumbeat to drumbeat, often with various time signatures within the same song. Taking a tip from \nthe Moody Blues, songs flow directly into each other without benefit of any lag time between selections. \nTaken as a whole, the album is kind of a rush, as quick, riff-laden guitar lines predominate for a few \nsongs before slowing down temporarily into a lull until the next takeoff. Lyrically, the album \ndifferentiates itself by exploring themes of the outer world and meanings of existence, often with \nreferences to the moon, sea, sun, and so on. Listeners may get the feeling of taking a journey to space \nin a rocket ship headed for destination unknown. Musically, the album is superior in all aspects. \nRod Evans has a strong rock voice, Rhino plays an enormous amount of hook-laden guitar lines, and \nLee Dorman plays complex basslines (for example, at the end of &quot;As the Moon Speaks-Return&quot;) that \nlead to typically rhythmic, nimble Bobby Caldwell drumming. The tightness between musicians is enormous, \nnever lets up for long, and leaves the listener feeling like the ride should continue for the indefinite \nfuture. ~ Michael Ofjord \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nemesis.1337x.org/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nemesis.1337x.org/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pow7.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pow7.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n[/code]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e15b8154a56168291d8205ae5ce5793c0c3f741b","amp;dn":"Captain+Beyond+-+Captain+Beyond+%28EAC+FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e15b8154a56168291d8205ae5ce5793c0c3f741b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,91,129,84,165,97,104,41,29,130,5,174,92,229,121,60,12,63,116,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
