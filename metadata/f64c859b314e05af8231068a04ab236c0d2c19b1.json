Then why is so little \n\nattention paid to reports of visitors from above? What \n\ndoes the media, and more importantly the government \n\nhave to gain by keeping this information from us?\n\nSince the Roswell &quot;incident&quot;, a grass roots movement \n\nhas sprung up worldwide asking these very questions. \n\nPeople are demanding that governments release any \n\n&quot;secret files&quot; regarding alien occurrences and slowly \n\nnations have responded. So far, 40 countries have \n\nopened their alien files to public scrutiny, including \n\nCanada, France, England and Japan. Even the US, long \n\nknown as the stingiest country in terms of releasing \n\nsensitive documents, has begun to share its alien case \n\nfiles.\n\nUnsealed: Alien Files is a ground-breaking new show \n\nthat shines a light on many of these archived alien \n\ndocuments. Each week Unsealed will tackle one \n\ncompelling alien case by opening these previously off-\n\nlimits secret files. Based on the newly discovered \n\ninformation we will re-examine evidence and follow \n\ndeveloping leads.\n\nUnsealed will investigate mass UFO sightings, personal \n\nabductions, government cover-ups and breaking alien \n\nnews from around the world. Thanks to advances in \n\ntechnology, the computer age has created a new type of \n\nconspiracy. We will delve into the &quot;photoshopping&quot; of \n\nspace, the value of Wikileaks, and the role social \n\nmedia plays in alien stories. Finally, we will examine \n\nthese newly released documents to see how alien \n\nvisitations may have affected our past, and what \n\ninfluence they may have on our future.\n\nThe show will feature cutting edge graphics, engaging \n\nmusic and a fast, energetic style that will appeal to \n\nboth alien experts and novices alike. Unsealed will \n\nhave believers wanting more and skeptics questioning \n\ntheir long held beliefs.\n\nUnsealed: Alien Files ... exposing the biggest secret \n\non planet Earth.
