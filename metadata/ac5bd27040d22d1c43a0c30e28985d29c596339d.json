(The final issue was published by the Marvel Magazines Group, another Marvel imprint.)\n\nMarvel Preview is notable for containing the first and early appearances of many Marvel characters like Blade (issue #3), Star-Lord (#4), Dominic Fortune (#2), Satana (#7), and many more. It also contained premiere artwork by Keith Giffen (in the back up story of issue #4 and #7, &quot;The Sword in the Star&quot;), and the first teaming of the celebrated X-Men creative trio of writer Chris Claremont, penciller John Byrne, and inker Terry Austin (in issue #11, featuring Star-Lord.)\n\nDespite a quarterly frequency, the magazine had a history of scheduling problems, with one &quot;Next Issue&quot; ad after another proving inaccurate. For example, #2 promised Thor the Mighty for #3, but a Blade story originally promoted as a serial for the recently cancelled Vampire Tales appeared, while the Thor material was not seen until #10. As of #25, the title was changed to Bizarre Adventures, which published an additional ten issues before folding in Feb. 1983. The final issue, #34, was a color comic book, a &quot;Hate the Holidays&quot; issue fronted with a story featuring Howard the Duck.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac5bd27040d22d1c43a0c30e28985d29c596339d","amp;dn":"Marvel+Preview-Bizarre+Adventures","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac5bd27040d22d1c43a0c30e28985d29c596339d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,91,210,112,64,210,45,28,67,160,195,14,40,152,93,41,197,150,51,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
