It won't be obvious that what you are listening to is a record. Thanks to beatlebren66, we now have a digital rendering of &quot;Unforgettable&quot; from a vinyl HMC package. The track order and selection differ from the bonus CD versionAll extraneous noises were removed, but noise reduction was not necessary.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n01 Paul's introduction + Nat King Cole - Unforgettable\n02 Peter &amp; Gordon - Someone Ain't Right\n03 Paul DJ\n04 The Beach Boys - I Get Around\n05 Paul DJ\n06 Martha &amp; The Vandellas - (Love Is Like A) Heat Wave\n07 Paul DJ with Peter Asher\n08 Elvis Presley - Don't Be Cruel\n09 Paul DJ\n10 The Rolling Stones - Down Home Girl\n11 Christmas record session 19 Oct 1965\n12 Paul - We Can Work It Out (demo)\n13 John - Tales Of Mrs. Tiggywinkle\n14 John - psychedelic nonsense #1\n15 We Can Work It Out (rough mix)\n16 Michelle (demo)\n17 Run For Your Life (take 5)\n18 In My Life (organ solo version)\n19 If I Needed Someone (alternate mix)\n20 John - psychedelic nonsense #2\n21 The Night Before (5.1 extraction)\n22 You've Got To Hide Your Love Away (5.1 extraction)\n\nffp, st5 files and artwork are included.\n\nPlease preserve the lossless quality of this material.\n\nPosted to Demonoid April 16, 2011.\n\nSpecial thanks to beatlebren66.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nRemasters Workshop\nRMW 688","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4aba3f9879c958fd41e782e2a75d4531667df02b","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Unforgettable+LP+%28Remastered+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4aba3f9879c958fd41e782e2a75d4531667df02b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,186,63,152,121,201,88,253,65,231,130,226,167,93,69,49,102,125,240,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
