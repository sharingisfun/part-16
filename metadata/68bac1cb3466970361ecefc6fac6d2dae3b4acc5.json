ROSES.\nThey proceeded to write the soundtrack of their lives and their environment. A cutthroat environment full of backstabbing, politics, selfishness and lawlessness. The daily struggle to survive while still attempting to achieve greatness. Men living reckless lives of debauchery and self-destruction. The mindset of somebody who needs drugs to survive. A world where one would not know if he or she would see their friends the following day, as their lives are just as reckless, and the worry that it engenders. The hopes of men trying breaking out of the hell they have put themselves through in order to achieve their dreams, and them latching on to their more innocent memories.\nThis exposed the Rock/Metal scene of Los Angeles for what it truly was: A desperate climate full of naÃƒÂ¯ve souls and hustlers looking to screw them at every corner, where violence, drugs and cheap sex were rampant. They showed all the insidious dealings and the obvious hedonism. They redefined what it was to be a bad-ass band, and revolutionized the Rock world.\nNot to say that their world is totally bleak, though. Brief moments of hope and sincerity are sprinkled throughout the album (?Sweet Child O? Mine?, ?Think About You?), showing that their world is not completely bleak, that the folks stuck in this world of hell do have some goodness to them.\nThat?s why GUNS N? ROSES succeeded. Amidst all the bullshit of the mainstream Rock world, here came five dudes that tore down genres, mixing together Glam Metal with the fury of Thrash and the feeling of Blues, with uncompromising attitude and emotion.\nIt?s no surprise that the music found on this record is deceptively complex, as their very competent musicians. Yea, they may have been wasted or coked out of their minds, but the music found herein has much subtlety to it, with many discrepancies and nuances within the melodies, while still having immense amount of balls and intensity. The rhythm section is very solid as well, reminiscent of the great rhythm players of the 70s, but a lot more restrained.\nTop it off with the vocals of Axl Rose. Say what you want about the man?s ego or his antics (chances are I?d agree with you), but GUNS N? ROSES would not have succeeded with anybody else. He had an unrivaled passion in his voice, managing to convey hatred, apathy (the ?I-wrecked-three-cars-today-and-I-couldn?t-care-less? kind, not the going-through-the-motions-kind?), sorry, nostalgia, rage and hope, and he is able to use his many singing voices to propel the mood of the song and its speaker forward.\nThe lyrics both reflect the personal lives of the members of GNR, and hint at the Axl?s volatile nature. Lyrics about misogyny (?It?s So Easy?, though now, that one part just makes me laugh. Look it up if you don?t know what I?m talking about) and Axl?s paranoid nature (?Out Ta Get Me?) are just foreshadowing some of the content he delves into on the ?Use Your Illusion? albums, and possibly his attitude within and towards the media. I don?t even have to MENTION what he did to the band halfway through the 90s, do I (if you?ve been living under a rock, just look it up ;-) )?\nThis album was GUNS N? ROSES at its most down and dirty, before getting (over?) ambitious with the ?Use Your Illusion? double album. They did it like no other, and they did it the best. I like the UYI albums, but this shows what they can do while on the throes of desperation.\nYou probably have an opinion about this album, considering it?s one of the most important in the history of modern music, and especially Rock &amp; Heavy Metal. For me, GUNS N? ROSES were the first band I got into, and their albums hold a very special place in my heart.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68bac1cb3466970361ecefc6fac6d2dae3b4acc5","amp;dn":"vGuns+N%5C%27+Roses+-+Appetite+For+Destruction+%281987%29+%28MFSL+UDCD+6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68bac1cb3466970361ecefc6fac6d2dae3b4acc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,186,193,203,52,102,151,3,97,236,239,198,250,198,210,218,227,180,172,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
