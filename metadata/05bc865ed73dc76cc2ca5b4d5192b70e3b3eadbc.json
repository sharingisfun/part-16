Out of Time, subtitled &quot;The Immediate Anthology,&quot; is the solution, its 49 songs drawn equally from Farlowe's singles, B-sides, EPs, and LP tracks, with the quality of the performances the only real deciding factor. The first half-dozen songs here could sell even the skeptics on Farlowe's talent, his renditions of &quot;In the Midnight Hour,&quot; &quot;Mr. Pitiful&quot; and &quot;Treat Her Right&quot; are among the most convincing white soul you're ever likely to hear from either side of the Atlantic, and they also explain precisely how Farlowe was able to share a stage with Otis Redding (the equivalent of visiting royalty) on Ready, Steady Go (when Farlowe covered his first Stones' song, &quot;Satisfaction,&quot; he used an arrangement that made it sound more like Otis than like the Stones). The only disadvantage is that the hits are, of necessity, spread out to two platters, but if it were solely the hits one were concerned with, then one would be getting one of those compilations, instead of this jewel, the next-best thing to a Chris Farlowe box set. The sound is never less than excellent -- and good and loud -- and the annotation is very thorough. This set makes the perfect companion to Rock 'n' Roll Soldier: Anthology 1970-2004.
