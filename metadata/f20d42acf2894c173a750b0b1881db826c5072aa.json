Born Lisa Dawn Rose-Wyatt in Holbrooks, Coventry, England, Lashes played her first event in 1996. During the event Lashes was a hit, and won her first residency. From there on out, Lashes made appearances at most (if not all) of England's top clubs, including Gatecrasher, UK: Base, and Temple Theater. Her skills at handling the large club crowds translated well to the festival circuit, and Lashes was a headliner at such events as Global Gathering, Homelands, Creamfields UK, and Knebworth.\n\nDisc 01\n\n[01] Global Drum Attack\t\t---&gt; E-Craig Vs.
