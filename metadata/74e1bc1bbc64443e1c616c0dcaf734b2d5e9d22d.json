It gives you specific wisdom of how to go from just living a mediocre life to finally living a life that you've only dreamed of. Here's what two of John Di Lemme's students have to say about this book...\n\n&quot;John's teachings radically transformed my life when I was at a point of giving up. It scares me to even think about where I would be today if it wasn't for John and his team. As one of John's elite coaching students, I have no only changed my life, but I have also radically exploded my business in a so-called poor economy. Today, I am a fired-up, laser-focused champion! I am excited about life and what God has in store for me.&quot; - Bev Ervin, Florida \n\n&quot;When I first met John in 2008, I was slowly killing myself by allowing my weight to soar to over 300 pounds. My obesity brought on diabetes, hypertension, and sleep apnea. I was plagued with an essential tremor and full of excuses of why I was not accomplishing my desired results in life. I was only 65 years old at the time, but I knew that I wouldn't last much longer if I didn't make a change. Today, I have shed over 125 pounds and gained a new respect for life. As I hold my beautiful granddaughter, Jewel, I can confidently say that I am eternally grateful for John's coaching that saved my life and taught me how to live again.&quot; - Dr. Benny McDaniel, Tennessee\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/6c0d/b3d3f6c3.png[/img]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74e1bc1bbc64443e1c616c0dcaf734b2d5e9d22d","amp;dn":"7+Principles+to+Live+a+Champion+Life+-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74e1bc1bbc64443e1c616c0dcaf734b2d5e9d22d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,225,188,27,188,100,68,62,28,97,108,13,202,247,52,178,213,233,210,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
