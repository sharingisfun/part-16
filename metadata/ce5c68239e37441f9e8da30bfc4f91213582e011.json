He was born in Kaysersberg in the province of Alsace-Lorraine, at that time part of the German Empire. Schweitzer, a Lutheran, challenged both the secular view of Jesus as depicted by historical-critical methodology current at his time in certain academic circles, as well as the traditional Christian view. He depicted Jesus as one who literally believed the end of the world was coming in his own lifetime and believed himself to be a world savior. He received the 1952 Nobel Peace Prize for his philosophy of &quot;Reverence for Life&quot;, expressed in many ways, but most famously in founding and sustaining the Albert Schweitzer Hospital in LambarÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©, now in Gabon, west central Africa (then French Equatorial Africa).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce5c68239e37441f9e8da30bfc4f91213582e011","amp;dn":"Albert+Schweitzer+-+An+Autobiography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce5c68239e37441f9e8da30bfc4f91213582e011","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,92,104,35,158,55,68,31,158,141,163,11,252,79,145,33,53,130,224,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
