They delve into the lionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s throat to find its voice box and make a new scientific discovery that helps explain how the vocal apparatus works like a trombone. To test their theory, compressed air is pumped into the windpipe and to everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s amazement, it makes the dead lion roar.\n\nFrom the outside, the lion and the tiger look very different, but once their skins are removed, even the experts find it hard to distinguish between the two. At Welgevonden, the team gets a chance to see the cat's weaponry Ã¢â‚¬â€ powerful forearms, protractile claws and powerful bite Ã¢â‚¬â€ up close on an anesthetized lioness, before watching a huge male devour a dead wildebeest. Richard Dawkins explains the evolutionary arms race that has arisen between predators and their prey in the struggle to survive.\n\nIn the final part of the program, the team analyzes the contrasting social lives of the two big cats to try and find out why male lions have a mane.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f90a4dd909ecc644dc04d941652cae61264f9e5a","amp;dn":"Inside+Nature%27s+Giants+-+The+Big+Cats+%5B2010%5D+PBS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f90a4dd909ecc644dc04d941652cae61264f9e5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,10,77,217,9,236,198,68,220,4,217,65,101,44,174,97,38,79,158,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
