(Other notables included Eric Clapton's solo debut and Joe Cocker's Mad Dogs and Englishmen.) Alone Together contains an excellent batch of melodically pleasing songs, built on a fat bed of strumming acoustic guitars with tasteful electric guitar accents and leads. Mason's vocals are embellished with harmonies from Rita Coolidge, Claudia Lennear, and Delaney &amp; Bonnie. Besides the well-known semi-hit &quot;Only You Know and I Know,&quot; and which was also a number 20 hit for Delaney &amp; Bonnie, highlights include the bouncy gospel-inflected &quot;Waitin' on You&quot; and the banjo-bejeweled &quot;Just a Song.&quot; &quot;Look at You Look at Me&quot; and the wonderfully wah-wahed &quot;Shouldn't Have Took More Than You Gave&quot; are reminiscent of Mason's former band, Traffic, whose drummer, Jim Capaldi is among the all-star cast assembled here. Alone Together represents Dave Mason at his peak. Later releases would betray lyrical shallowness, forced rhymes, and cliched guitar licks. But here, everything comes together perfectly. The original vinyl release of Alone Together was also noteworthy for the marble grain of the record itself ? as the record played on the turntable, the tonearm appeared to be floating through the clouds.\n\n\nTrack list\n  1.
