The cinema occupies an important place in the overall development of art and literature. As such it is a powerful ideological weapon for the revolution and construction. Therefore, concentrating efforts on the cinema, making breakthroughs and following up success in all areas of art and literature is the basic principle that we must adhere to in revolutionizing art and literature.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nKim Jong Il (1942- ) is leader of North Korea (1994- ).
