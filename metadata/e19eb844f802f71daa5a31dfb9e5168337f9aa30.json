He works at a Starbucks and is obsessed with the Beatles. He has a daughter with a homeless woman; she abandons them as soon as they leave the hospital. He names his daughter Lucy Diamond (after the Beatles song), and raises her. But as she reaches age 7 herself, Sam&amp;#039;s limitations start to become a problem at school; she&amp;#039;s intentionally holding back to avoid looking smarter than him. The authorities take her away, and Sam shames high-priced lawyer Rita Harrison into taking his case pro bono. In the process, he teaches her a great deal about love, and whether it&amp;#039;s really all you need.  \nCast:\nSean Penn\t ... \tSam Dawson\n\n\tMichelle Pfeiffer\t... \tRita Harrison Williams\n\n\tDakota Fanning\t... \tLucy Diamond Dawson\n\n\tDianne Wiest\t... \tAnnie Cassell\n\n\tLoretta Devine\t... \tMargaret Calgrove\n\n\tRichard Schiff\t... \tMr. Turner\n\n\tLaura Dern\t... \tRandy Carpenter\n\tBrad Silverman\t... \tBrad (as Brad Allan Silverman)\n\tJoseph Rosenberg\t... \tJoe\n\n\tStanley DeSantis\t... \tRobert\n\n\tDoug Hutchison\t... \tIfty\n\tRosalind Chao\t... \tLily\n\tKen Jenkins\t... \tJudge Philip McNeily\n\n\tWendy Phillips\t... \tMiss Wright\n\tMason Lucero\t... \tConner Rhodes\nLink:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0277027/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e19eb844f802f71daa5a31dfb9e5168337f9aa30","amp;dn":"I+am+sam+DVDRip+Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e19eb844f802f71daa5a31dfb9e5168337f9aa30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,158,184,68,248,2,247,29,170,90,49,223,185,229,22,131,55,249,170,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
