Its definitions are full sentences and not just phrases. It had phonetic transcriptions except the 6th edition. The transcriptions were based on the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) Ã¢â‚¬â€ the most popular phonetic alphabet in the world. A digital version on CD-ROM was included with the paper one of the book. Unfortunately, the CCAD seems to skimp on American English, but there is its equivalent titled Collins COBUILD Advanced Dictionary of American English.\n\n\nWhy 5th edition is better than 6th edition ??\n\n\nUnless you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a computer and have to use a book dictionary. 5th Edition is the best. But the 6th Edition is Useless because:\n\nA few fairly useless new entries (e.g. Bluetooth, open-source) that you can look up on Wikipedia\n\nThe design is nicer, with better paper quality and more colors (see example pages)\n\nSome illustrations next to entries (the previous edition only had illustrations in a separate section)\n\nFor some words, there are Ã¢â‚¬Å“Word PartnershipÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ boxes which give common phrases (collocations) with the word.\n\nThere are also occasional Ã¢â‚¬Å“ThesaurusÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ boxes (with synonyms) and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Word WebÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ boxes.\n\nThe new fifth edition of the &quot;Collins Cobuild Advanced Learner's English Dictionary&quot; offers up-to-date coverage of today's English in a clear, attractive format.
