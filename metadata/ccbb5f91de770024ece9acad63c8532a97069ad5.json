Yet Arthur Herman reveals how their lives and careers became intertwined as the twentieth century unfolded. Both men would go on to lead their nations through harrowing trials and two world warsÃ¢â‚¬â€and become locked in a fierce contest of wills that would decide the fates of countries, continents, and ultimately an empire. Here is a sweeping epic with a fascinating supporting cast, and a brilliant narrative parable of two men whose great successes were always haunted by personal failureÃ¢â‚¬â€and whose final moments of triumph were overshadowed by the loss of what they held most dear.\n\nPaperback: 736 pages\nPublisher: Bantam (April 28, 2009)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0553383760\nISBN-13: 978-0553383768\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
