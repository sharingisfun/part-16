She constantly claims that her brother Orestes will return to right the injustice and expel the usurper who rules the country with an iron fist. A messenger brings word that Orestes is dead, but soon thereafter he appears, to do exactly what the 'mad' Electra has foretold.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9aee3f4e45f41e613ad143c36971f7acefb4527","amp;dn":"Electra%2C+My+Love+%28Miklos+Jancso+-+1974%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9aee3f4e45f41e613ad143c36971f7acefb4527","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,174,227,244,228,95,65,230,19,173,20,60,54,151,31,122,206,251,69,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
