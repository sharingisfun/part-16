Instead, Halstead's Sleeping on Roads--basically, a home recording featuring a bunch of his friends contributing everything from &quot;computer skills and technical stuff&quot; to &quot;funny noises&quot;--dims the lights even more. While tracks like the chiming, trumpet-tweaked opener &quot;Seasons&quot; point to a keen sense of melody, Halstead wastes no time in shifting the mood, and gaslight weepers like &quot;Martha's Mantra (for the Pain),&quot; &quot;High Hopes,&quot; and &quot;Dreamed I Saw Soldiers&quot;--all almost unbearably downcast ruminations--dominate the set. Still, Halstead's delicate touch with guitar and his barely-there vocals sustain the sense of quiet introspection throughout the album's nine tracks. Winsome, ethereal folk never sounded so good, or so haunted\n\n1. Seasons  \n 2. Two Stones in My Pocket  \n 3. Driving With Bert  \n 4. Hi-Lo and Inbetween  \n 5. See You on Rooftops  \n 6.
