This chronicle of the Fab Four begins when the group consisted of five musicians: \nJohn Lennon (Stephen MacKenna), Paul McCartney (Rod Culbertson), George Harrison (John Altman), \nStu Sutcliffe (David Wilkinson), and Pete Best (Ryan Michael). The group begins its career in the dregs \nof a Hamburg, Germany nightclub (most of the film was made on location). Under the tutelage of manager \nBrian Epstein (Brian Jameson), the group sheds its rough-hewn image in favor of choirboy haircuts and \nEton collars; along the way, Sutcliffe dies and drummer Best is replaced by Richard Starkey, \n(aka Ringo Starr, played here by Ray Ashcroft). First aired in the U.S. on November 23, 1979, \nBirth of the Beatles is significant as the only Beatle biopic made while John Lennon was still alive. \n\nSpeed of film corrected for the first time ever!\nAll songs in the correct key and tempo.\n\n\nStephen MacKenna   \t- John Lennon [Performer]\nRod Culbertson  \t- Paul McCatiney [Performer]\nRay Ashcroft  \t- Ringo Starr [Performer]\nRyan Michael  \t- Pete Best [Performer]\nDavid Wilkinson  \t- Stuarl Sutcliffe [Performer]\nJohn Altman  \t- George Harrison [Performer]\nPerry Benson  \t- Page Boy [Performer]\nGary Bleasdale  \t- Boy in NEMS [Performer]\nClaire Davenport  \t- Nude [Performer]\nHarry Ditson  \t- Reporter [Performer]\nGareth Forwood  \t- Alden [Performer]\nNigel Havers  \t- George Martin [Performer]\nColette Hiller  \t- Reporter [Performer]\nMichael Howarth  \t- Philip [Performer]\nPaula Jacobs  \t- Mrs. Flemming [Performer]\nBrian Jameson  \t- Brian Epstein [Performer]\nBrigitte Kahn  \t- German Waitress [Performer]\nRichard Marner  \t- Club Boss [Performer]\nTony Mathews  \t- As It Man [Performer]\nBunny May  \t- Sound Engineer [Performer]\nWendy Morgan  \t- Cynthia Lennon [Performer]\nChristopher Muncke  \t- Reporter [Performer]\nGary Olsen  \t- Rory Storm [Performer]\nAlyson Spiro  \t- Astrid [Performer]\nPat Starr  \t- Reporter [Performer]\nMatt Zimmerman  \t- Reporter [Performer] ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f64383549a01160df43cd595be046987f56859a","amp;dn":"Birth.of.the.Beatles.re-mastered.soundtrack.corrected.Xivd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f64383549a01160df43cd595be046987f56859a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,100,56,53,73,160,17,96,223,67,205,89,91,224,70,152,127,86,133,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
