Most kids were infatuated with the look of Kiss, not their music. Decked out in outrageously flamboyant costumes and makeup, the band fashioned a captivating stage show featuring dry ice, smoke bombs, elaborate lighting, blood spitting, and fire breathing that captured the imaginations of thousands of kids. But Kiss' music shouldn't be dismissed -- it was a commercially potent mix of anthemic, fist-pounding hard rock driven by sleek hooks and ballads powered by loud guitars, cloying melodies, and sweeping strings. It was a sound that laid the groundwork for both arena rock and the pop-metal that dominated rock in the late '80s. \n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Hell Or Hallelujah\n02.Wall Of Sound\n03.Freak\n04.Back To The Stone Age\n05.Shout Mercy\n06.Long Way Down\n07.Eat Your Heart Out\n08.The Devil Is Me\n09.Outta This World\n10.All For The Love Of Rock &amp; Roll\n11.Take Me Down Below\n12.Last Chance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        ****Please Don't Forget To Seed****\n                                \n                                  ****Thanks****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab1b1a8845b86657f2132efdc5ecff611eea7a46","amp;dn":"Kiss+-+Monster+%282012%29+mp3+%5B320%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab1b1a8845b86657f2132efdc5ecff611eea7a46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,27,26,136,69,184,102,87,242,19,46,253,197,236,255,97,30,234,122,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
