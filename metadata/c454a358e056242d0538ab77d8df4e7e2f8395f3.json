It is an exceptionally useful reference for both pharmacists and pharmacy students. It communicates a wealth of information that is well researched and referenced. The seventh edition is a much needed update.&quot;--Doody's Review Service \n\nWhen it comes to helping you develop a mastery of evidence-based medicine for optimal patient outcomes, no book can match Pharmacotherapy: A Pathophysiologic Approach. Like the discipline it covers, the scope of this trusted resource goes beyond drug indications and dosages to include the initial selection, proper administration, and monitoring of drugs. Pharmacotherapy delivers everything you need to know to provide safe, effective drug therapy across the full range of therapeutic categories.\n\nThe book also delves into psychosocial issues that affect compliance--topics related to a patient's ability to understand and manage often-complex therapy--and lifestyle changes that may reduce the need for drug therapy or improve pharmacotherapeutic outcomes.\n\n\n2592 pages \nPublisher: McGraw-Hill Medical; 7 edition (June 4, 2008) \nISBN-13: 978-0071478991 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c454a358e056242d0538ab77d8df4e7e2f8395f3","amp;dn":"Pharmacotherapy+7th+edition+McGraw+Hill+Dipiro+et+al.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c454a358e056242d0538ab77d8df4e7e2f8395f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,84,163,88,224,86,36,45,5,56,171,119,216,223,78,126,47,131,149,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
