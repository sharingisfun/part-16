How else to explain the dreams he keeps havingÃ¢â‚¬â€dreams that mirror, with impossible accuracy, the gruesome serial murders taking place all over San Francisco? How else to explain the feelings these dreams provoke in himÃ¢â‚¬â€not disgust, not horror, but excitement.\n\nAs Bryan and his longtime partner, Lawrence Ã¢â‚¬Å“PookieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Chang, investigate the murders, they learn that things are even stranger than they at first seem. For the victims are all enemies of a seemingly ordinary young boyÃ¢â‚¬â€a boy who is gripped by the same dreams that haunt Bryan.  Meanwhile, a shadowy vigilante, seemingly armed with superhuman powers, is out there killing the killers.  And Bryan and PookieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s superiorsÃ¢â‚¬â€from the mayor on downÃ¢â‚¬â€seem strangely eager to keep the detectives from discovering the truth.\n\nDoubting his own sanity and stripped of his badge, Bryan begins to suspect that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stumbled into the crosshairs of a shadow war that has gripped his city for more than a centuryÃ¢â‚¬â€a war waged by a race of killers living in San FranciscoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unknown, underground ruins, emerging at night to feed on those who will not be missed.\n\nAnd as Bryan learns the truth about his own intimate connections to the killings, he discovers that those who matter most to him are in mortal dangerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and that he may be the only man giftedÃ¢â‚¬â€or cursedÃ¢â‚¬â€with the power to do battle with the nocturnals.\n\nFeaturing a dazzlingly plotted mystery and a terrifying descent into a nightmarish underworldÃ¢â‚¬â€along with some of the most incredible action scenes ever put to paper, and an explosive, gut-wrenching conclusion you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t soon forget Ã¢â‚¬â€ Nocturnal is the most spectacular outing to date from one of the genreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brightest stars. \n\nREVIEWS: \nfor fans of realistically presented horror fiction, this is a must-read.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Booklist\n\n&quot;A hugely enjoyable read by an author who continues to grow.&quot; Brittish Fantasy Society \n\n&quot;Some of the most beautiful carnage we've seen in ages.&quot; io9.com \n\n&quot;Do yourself a favor and read Nocturnal, unless youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re excessively squeamish and hate Ã¢â‚¬Å“no-noÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ words. Then donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t.&quot; Nerdist.com \n\n&quot;From the depth of the characters Sigler builds, to the detailed world he creates under the surface of San Francisco (literally in some cases) this book is gripping, terrifying and heartwrenching all at once.&quot; Skepchick.org\n\n&quot;If you're a fan of police procedurals from Michael Connolly, Elmore Leonard or Joseph Wambaugh and you miss the bio-tech science fiction of the late, great Michael Crichton, you'll find &quot;Nocturnal&quot; a treat.&quot; Huntington News  \n\n&quot;This is one of the most original pieces of genre fiction I have read in a long time.
