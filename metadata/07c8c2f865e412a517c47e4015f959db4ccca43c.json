Trouble is, those lonely slide-guitar notes have also attracted a colossal sea beast named Steve with, shall we say, a thing for explosive oil tanker trucks. Suddenly, morose Pine Cove turns libidinous and is hit by a mysterious crime wave, and a beleaguered constable has to fight off his own gonzo appetites to find out whats wrong and what, if anything, to do about it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07c8c2f865e412a517c47e4015f959db4ccca43c","amp;dn":"Christopher+Moore+-+The+Lust+Lizard+of+Melancholy+Cove","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07c8c2f865e412a517c47e4015f959db4ccca43c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,200,194,248,101,228,18,165,23,196,126,64,21,249,89,219,76,204,164,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
