Occult detectives. Ghost hunters. Monster fighters. Humans who unravel uncanny crimes and solve psychic puzzles. Sleuths with supernatural powers of their own who provide services far beyond those normal gumshoes, shamuses, and Sherlocks can. When vampires, werewolves, and things that go Ã¢â‚¬Å“bumpÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the night are part of your world, criminals can be as inhuman as the crimes they commit, and magic can seep into the mundane. Those who solve the mysteries, bring justice, or even save the world itself, might utter spells, wield wands as well as firearms, or simply use their powers of deduction. Some of the best tales from top authors of the twenty-first centuryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most popular genres take you down mean streets and into strange crime scenes in this fantastic compilation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e63a8c85362766174101d5e2fca8d7b854f6c0fe","amp;dn":"Weird+Detectives%3A+Recent+Investigations+-+Neil+Gaiman%2CPaula+Gura","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e63a8c85362766174101d5e2fca8d7b854f6c0fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,58,140,133,54,39,102,23,65,1,213,226,252,168,215,184,84,246,192,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
