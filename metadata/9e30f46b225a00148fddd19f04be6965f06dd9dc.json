Unlike some\nbooks that concentrate on just a single program, such as the shell program, bash, this book will try to convey how to get along with the command line interface in a larger sense. How does it all work? What can it do? What's the best way to use it?\n\nThis is not a book about Linux system administration. While any serious discussion of the command line will invariably lead to system administration topics, this book only touches on a few administration issues. It will, however, prepare the reader for additional study by providing a solid foundation in the use of the command line, an essential tool for any serious system administration task.\n\nThis book is very Linux-centric. Many other books try to broaden their appeal by including other platforms such as generic Unix and OS X. In doing so, they Ã¢â‚¬Å“water downÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ their content to feature only general topics. This book, on the other hand, only covers contemporary Linux distributions. Ninety-five percent of the content is useful for users of other Unix-like systems, but this book is highly targeted at the modern Linux command line user.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/files/2012/07/linuxcommandline.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/files/2012/07/linuxcommandline.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e30f46b225a00148fddd19f04be6965f06dd9dc","amp;dn":"The+Linux+Command+Line","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e30f46b225a00148fddd19f04be6965f06dd9dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,48,244,107,34,90,0,20,143,221,209,159,4,190,105,101,240,109,217,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
