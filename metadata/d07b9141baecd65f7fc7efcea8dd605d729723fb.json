There is no need to tell you how awful this record, McCartney&amp;#039;s latest, sounds.\n\nThis minimal remastering, done by me (I&amp;#039;m a professionnal sound engineer), is a tentative of restoring all the &quot;sonic details&quot; lost during the audio destruction (read : compression) process.\n\nEven though I can&amp;#039;t do no miracles (double negation !), this is the best I could achieve out of those permanently destroyed tapes. I also reduced the volume output in order not to compress even the most minimal peak created during the dynamic range restoration. Back in the 60&amp;#039;s, records were that loud. Why would they be louder today ?\n\nHope you&amp;#039;ll enjoy it as much as I... and by the way, this torrent is also available in high quality MP3 for those without a FLAC player !\n\nChris","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d07b9141baecd65f7fc7efcea8dd605d729723fb","amp;dn":"FLAC+-+Paul+McCartney+-+Memory+Almost+Full+%28remaster%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d07b9141baecd65f7fc7efcea8dd605d729723fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,123,145,65,186,236,214,95,127,199,239,206,168,221,96,93,114,151,35,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
