Ed will call on all of his expertise in extreme terrains and climates to uncover the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5)  Zambia \r\nEd's journey is inspired by an intriguing satellite image of some giant germ-like shapes, measuring up to 30 metres long, located in one of the most remote areas of western Zambia. To reach his target, Ed must cross the mighty Zambezi River and flood plain. His quest leads him to ask for help from the royal family of Barotseland, and he has a terrifying encounter with the local wildlife. As he nears the target, Ed is forced to travel with an armed guard, who becomes a valued companion. And, in order to complete his mission, Ed must first win the trust of local villagers who live cheek-by-jowl with some of the most dangerous wildlife in Africa.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6c/Into-the-Unknown-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/01/Into-the-Unknown-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/40/Into-the-Unknown-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cf/Into-the-Unknown-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e5/Into-the-Unknown-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/32/Into-the-Unknown-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/23/Into-the-Unknown-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ae/Into-the-Unknown-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ae/Into-the-Unknown-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f0/Into-the-Unknown-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/88/Into-the-Unknown-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a8/Into-the-Unknown-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6d/Into-the-Unknown-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/11/Into-the-Unknown-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a0/Into-the-Unknown-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/48/Into-the-Unknown-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3192 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 44mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 5\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1,003 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.discoveryuk.com/shows/ed-stafford-into-the-unknown/episodes/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fa7b4601300d25d2852f26b5684cabf765b618f","amp;dn":"Ed+Stafford+Into+The+Unknown+Series+1+5of5+Zambia+720p+x264+AAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fa7b4601300d25d2852f26b5684cabf765b618f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,167,180,96,19,0,210,93,40,82,242,107,86,132,202,191,118,91,97,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
