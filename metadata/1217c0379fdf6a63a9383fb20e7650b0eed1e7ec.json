Forever.\n\nHad anyone told Alice Bell that her entire life would change course between one heartbeat and the next, she would have laughed. From blissful to tragic, innocent to ruined? Please. But that's all it took. One heartbeat. A blink, a breath, a second, and everything she knew and loved was gone.\n\nHer father was right. The monsters are realÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.\n\nTo avenge her family, Ali must learn to fight the undead. To survive, she must learn to trust the baddest of the bad boys, Cole Holland. But Cole has secrets of his own, and if Ali isn't careful, those secrets might just prove to be more dangerous than the zombiesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.\n\n\nI wish I could go back and do a thousand things differently.\nI'd tell my sister no.\nI'd never beg my mother to talk to my dad.\nI'd zip my lips and swallow those hateful words.\nOr, barring all of that, I'd hug my sister, my mom and my dad one last time.\nI'd tell them I love them.\nI wish... Yeah, I wish.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1217c0379fdf6a63a9383fb20e7650b0eed1e7ec","amp;dn":"Alice+in+Zombieland+%28epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1217c0379fdf6a63a9383fb20e7650b0eed1e7ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,23,192,55,159,223,106,99,169,56,63,178,14,118,80,176,238,209,231,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
