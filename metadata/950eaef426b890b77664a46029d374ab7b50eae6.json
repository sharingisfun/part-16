This CD reissues his second record of the period and has among its highlights the original version of &quot;Viva Tirado&quot; (a catchy number made into a surprise pop hit by El Chicano later in the decade) and a driving rendition of &quot;MIlestones&quot;; the other seven songs (six of which are Wilson's originals) are also quite enjoyable. Among the more notable soloists are trumpeter Carmell Jones, both Teddy Edwards and Harold Land on tenor, guitarist Joe Pass, and pianist Jack Wilson. Recommended. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Viva Tirado\n02 - Moment Of Truth\n03 - Patterns\n04 - Terri\n05 - Nancy Jo\n06 - Milestones\n07 - Latino\n08 - Josephina\n09 - Emerge\n\nSplit with Medieval.\nEnjoy and share!
