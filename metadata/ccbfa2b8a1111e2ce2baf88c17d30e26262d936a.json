It will be years before the next gemcraft is released..\n\nLove and light,\nsigned your most bestest friend that you never had because you were too scared to talk to me when we passed by each other in real life that one day,\nokonomiyaki","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccbfa2b8a1111e2ce2baf88c17d30e26262d936a","amp;dn":"Gemcraft+2+Chasing+Shadows+v1.0.14+Cracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccbfa2b8a1111e2ce2baf88c17d30e26262d936a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,191,162,184,161,17,30,44,226,186,248,140,23,211,14,38,38,45,147,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
