But he does not enjoy his newfound, dearly-won kingship... Restructured, but all the dialogue is Shakespeare&amp;#039;s.\n\nFor sheer mood and feel, I prefer this Macbeth over all the others out there. The darkness and dampness that close in on Welles as the movie progresses is claustrophobic and really gives a gritty appeal to this film. A great example of b&amp;w film used to its fullest potential.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040558/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040558/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFree Harry Roberts http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Maurice_Robert","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c82e1e71083c01392a1fc88ac5d7943c35b7f4c","amp;dn":"Macbeth.Shakespeare.Orson.Welles.1948.Free.Harry.Roberts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c82e1e71083c01392a1fc88ac5d7943c35b7f4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,130,225,231,16,131,192,19,146,161,252,136,172,93,121,67,195,91,127,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
