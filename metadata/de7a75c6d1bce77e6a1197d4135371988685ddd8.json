All of Peter &amp; Gordon's U.K. chart entries are included as well, one of which was a cover of the Barbara Lewis hit &quot;Baby I'm Yours&quot; that was not released as a single stateside. The remaining three selections on the 18-song album are the duo's versions of the Everly Brothers' &quot;Let It Be Me&quot; and the movie themes &quot;High Noon&quot; and &quot;Exodus Song,&quot; which were LP tracks from 1966-1967. Licensed from EMI, the tracks sound good, in a combination of mono and stereo, though they seem to be straight transfers without any sort of sound improvement. There have been several compilations of Peter &amp; Gordon's hits; this one is fairly complete, and if it can be purchased for a reasonable price, it may satisfy an average fan's basic need for their best-known recordings. \n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
