New clues are being discovered not in volcanoes or canyons, but inside each of us. From a case of hiccups to the sensation of dÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ  vu to how we throw a football, quirks of the human body and mind all trace back to enormous transformations on Earth, millions and even billions of years in the past. Inside us are the keys to asteroid impacts, global mass extinctions, and shifting continents...ultimately revealing the epic story of Earth's past--and our own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83992484cf17589a79e1d0fa9e2c0bf794a84ae5","amp;dn":"history+channel%3A+how+the+earth+made+man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83992484cf17589a79e1d0fa9e2c0bf794a84ae5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,153,36,132,207,23,88,154,121,225,208,250,158,44,11,247,148,168,74,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
