When many bands half their age are already going soft and selling out, Europe continues to up the hard rock ante. \n\nSure, this album, as a whole, is not quite as bombastic as it's predecessor, &quot;Secret Society,&quot; but there are more songs with hooks on this album. The title track is epic, and will stick in your head. The ballad &quot;New Love in Town&quot; seems to blend together earlier hits &quot;Carrie&quot; and &quot;Prisoner in Paradise&quot; and add a little blues touch into the mix. &quot;The Beast&quot; is a hard rock track that sounds as if it could have come right off of their earliest albums. &quot;U Devil U&quot; and &quot;Gonna Get Ready&quot; begin with a bad*** slow, grinding beat and burst into big melodic choruses. The album blends the sounds of old Europe and new Eurpoe, and does so effectively. \n\nNot every track is perfect, though. &quot;Catch that Plane&quot; sounds monotone, and the album loses considerable steam as it winds down, but it is redeemed by the inclusion of the two live tracks, which are incredible performances that inject life into the album to close it out on a great note. Europe may have sung &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; back in 1987....but as &quot;Only Young Twice&quot; proves, this band has new life and they are living it, apparently, to the fullest. If this is what a midlife crisis sounds like, I cannot wait for mine to begin! 4.5 stars. \n\nby Cory T.
