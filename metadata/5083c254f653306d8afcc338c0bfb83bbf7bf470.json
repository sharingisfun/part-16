From this unlikely partnership, The Hard Road: Restrung was born. This mammoth achievement took home the 2007 ARIA Award for Best Urban Release and has become the first Hip-Hop remix album to be certified Gold in Australia. The forthcoming Hilltop Hoods DVD release, City Of Light, documents the making and touring of these iconic albums, allowing an insight into the creative dynamic of one of the most innovative groups in Australian music. City Of Light incorporates 2 hours of exclusive interviews and music videos, including extensive live and behind the scenes footage from the \\\\\\&amp;#039;Restrung\\\\\\&amp;#039; album launch. This unique show saw the Hoods perform alongside the 31 piece Adelaide Symphony Orchestra to a full house at the Adelaide Entertainment Centre. It quite simply must be seen to be believed. Maintaining their tireless work ethic, the Hoods are already in the studio recording their next album and preparing for a summer full of festival appearances including the National Big Day Out tour, Rollercoaster and Pyramid Rock Festival.\n\nwww.hilltophoods.com\nwww.myspace.com/hilltophoods\nwww.obeserecords.com &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hilltophoods.com/shop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hilltophoods.com/shop&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCHAPTERS\n\n01 Intro\n02 The Road Begins\n03 X-Bred Studios\n04 Artwork\n05 Clown Prince\n06 Recording\n07 The Hard Road\n08 The Hard Road Video\n09 The Stopping All Stations Tour\n10 Circuit Breaker\n11 What a Great Night\n12 Audience with the Devil\n13 Recapturing the Vibe\n14 Restrung\n15 Mixing Restrung\n16 Launching Restrung\n17 Breathe\n18 Conversations from a Speakeasy\n19 Obese Lowlifes\n20 Roll on Up\n21 Credits\n\n*********************************************************\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5083c254f653306d8afcc338c0bfb83bbf7bf470","amp;dn":"Hilltop+Hoods+City+Of+Light+DVD+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5083c254f653306d8afcc338c0bfb83bbf7bf470","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,131,194,84,246,83,48,109,138,252,195,56,192,191,184,59,191,123,244,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
