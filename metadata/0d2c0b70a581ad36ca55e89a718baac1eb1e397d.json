In the first movie, &quot;Phanagoria&quot;, we see the so-called &quot;Old Great Bulgaria&quot; of Khan Kubrat, in the lands of modern Ukraine and Southern Russia, as well as the disintegration of the country between his five sons and their dispersal across Europe. We are also introduced to our two main characters - the titular Asparuh, Kubrat's third son, and Belisarius - the son of a Roman (Byzantine) diplomat, who was left as a noble hostage in the Bulgar court, but eventually befriended Asparuh and came to see the Bulgars as something more than just another barbarian tribe.\r\n\r\nOriginal title: Ð¥Ð°Ð½ ÐÑÐ¿Ð°Ñ€ÑƒÑ… - Ð¤Ð°Ð½Ð°Ð³Ð¾Ñ€Ð¸Ñ\r\nGenre: Historical\r\nCountry: Bulgaria\r\nDuration: 01:32:00\r\nYear: 1981\r\nLanguage: Bulgarian\r\nSubtitles: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d2c0b70a581ad36ca55e89a718baac1eb1e397d","amp;dn":"Han+Asparuh+part+I+%281981%29+288p+DVDRip-Zamunda+%5BEN+sub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d2c0b70a581ad36ca55e89a718baac1eb1e397d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,44,11,112,165,129,173,54,202,85,232,154,113,139,170,193,235,30,57,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
