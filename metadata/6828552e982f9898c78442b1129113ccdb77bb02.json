Faye Dunaway does solid work as the frightened and mystified woman whom he forces to conceal him, and Max von Sydow is appropriately cool as a professional assassin. That same, sustained tone of danger and expectation that made Pollack's The Firm so much fun can be found in this 1975 thriller, albeit with an appropriate dose of post-Watergate paranoia.\n\n  Starring: Robert Redford, Faye Dunaway, Cliff Robertson, Max von Sydow, John Houseman.\n\n  Directed by: Sydney Pollack.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 57min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 336\n\n  Frame Rate: 23fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6828552e982f9898c78442b1129113ccdb77bb02","amp;dn":"Three+Days+Of+The+Condor+%281975%29+%28Robert+Redford%2C+Faye+Dunaway%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6828552e982f9898c78442b1129113ccdb77bb02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,40,85,46,152,47,152,152,199,132,66,177,18,145,19,204,219,119,187,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
