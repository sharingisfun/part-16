With the popularity of Swing Parades soaring, a full length motion picture was inevitable.  Unfortunately, the film we got was clearly rushed out to capitalize on the Swing Parade fad.

After all, a movie with mannish landlords, songs about blind mules, and Larry must be pretty ripe for mockery.  And if it's called Swing Parade but does not feature any actual Swing Parades, then all the better!  Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett ofand Mystery Science Theater 3000 make no false claims: They provide no Swing Parades, only hilarious commentary.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRiffTrax are comedy audio commentaries of Hollywood movies, television programs and films featuring Mystery Science Theater 3000 comedians Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett heckling (or riffing) films in the style of MST3K, a TV show in which Nelson was the head writer, and later the host. The RiffTrax are sold online and delivered by streaming video and download. The site was launched by Nelson and Legend Films, now renamed Legend3D, in 2006 and is based in San Diego. In 2012, Rifftrax was purchased from Legend3D by Mike, Kevin and Bill and the RiffTrax CEO David G. Martin.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67cc2f918b99ebc45b60480a6f10b2b160337206","amp;dn":"RiffTrax+-+Swing+Parade+%28%23021%2C+082+Triple+Audio+B%26amp%3BW%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67cc2f918b99ebc45b60480a6f10b2b160337206","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,204,47,145,139,153,235,196,91,96,72,10,111,16,178,177,96,51,114,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
