This handy guide brings together a unique collection of valuable MapReduce patterns that will save you time and effort regardless of the domain, language, or development framework youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re using.\n\nEach pattern is explained in context, with pitfalls and caveats clearly identified to help you avoid common design mistakes when modeling your big data architecture. This book also provides a complete overview of MapReduce that explains its origins and implementations, and why design patterns are so important. All code examples are written for Hadoop.\n\n- Summarization patterns: get a top-level view by summarizing and grouping data\n- Filtering patterns: view data subsets such as records generated from one user\n- Data organization patterns: reorganize data to work with other systems, or to make MapReduce analysis easier\n- Join patterns: analyze different datasets together to discover interesting relationships\n- Metapatterns: piece together several patterns to solve multi-stage problems, or to perform several analytics in the same job\n- Input and output patterns: customize the way you use Hadoop to load or store data\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A clear exposition of MapReduce programs for common data processing patternsÃ¢â‚¬â€this book is indespensible for anyone using Hadoop.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œTom White, author of Hadoop: The Definitive Guide\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
