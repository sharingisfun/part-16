Despite this, corporate governance failed to prevent a widespread default of fiduciary duties of corporate boards and managerial responsibilities in the finance industry, which contributed to the 2007-2010 global financial crisis. This book brings together leading scholars from North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East to provide fresh and critical analytical insights on the systemic failures of corporate governance linked to the global financial crisis. Contributors draw from a range of disciplines to demonstrate the severe limitations of the dominant corporate governance framework and its associated market-oriented approach. They provide suggestions on how the governance problems could be tackled to prevent or mitigate any future financial crisis and explore new directions for post-crisis corporate governance research and reforms.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f18dc7c159ebf887257a5c538b19c354d82f8cb1","amp;dn":"Corporate+Governance+and+the+Global+Financial+Crisis%3A+Internatio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f18dc7c159ebf887257a5c538b19c354d82f8cb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,141,199,193,89,235,248,135,37,122,92,83,139,25,195,84,216,47,140,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
