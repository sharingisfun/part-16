It took him from the colossal supermarkets of California to IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wrecked paddy-fields and AfricaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bankrupt coffee farms, while along the way he ate genetically engineered soy beans and dodged flying objects in the protestor-packed streets of South Korea.\n\nWhat he found was shocking, from the false choices given us by supermarkets to a global epidemic of farmer suicides, and real reasons for famine in Asia and Africa.\n\nYet he also found great cause for hopeÃ¢â‚¬â€in international resistance movements working to create a more democratic, sustainable and joyful food system. Going beyond ethical consumerism, Patel explains, from seed to store to plate, the steps to regain control of the global food economy, stop the exploitation of both farmers and consumers, and rebalance global sustenance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c4a1a7e65710adf460d5d85e503bd9c3a333178","amp;dn":"Patel%2C+Raj+-+Stuffed+and+Starved+-+The+Hidden+Battle+for+the+Wor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c4a1a7e65710adf460d5d85e503bd9c3a333178","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,74,26,126,101,113,10,223,70,13,93,133,229,3,189,156,58,51,49,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
