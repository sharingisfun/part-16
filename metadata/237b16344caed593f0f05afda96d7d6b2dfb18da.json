This is the authoritative career-spanning overview that MotÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¶rhead fans have been waiting for. When Lemmy Kilmister, uh, left Hawkwind in 1975 (he was axed), he dreamed of doing, in his words, \\&quot;the British version of the MC5, simple as that\\&quot;. Of course, his little \\&quot;fast and vicious\\&quot; outfit made quite a name for themselves, and this set celebrates the group in all of its testosterone-fueled glory. With 99 tracks spread over five CDs, Stone Deaf Forever offers a glimpse of every single phase of the band\\&amp;#039;s evolution from punk-metal burners to plodding metal gods--every album and every lineup is represented. (The classic trio incarnation -- Lemmy, \\&quot;Fast\\&quot; Eddie Clarke, and \\&quot;Philthy Animal\\&quot; Taylor -- is responsible for more than a disc and a half\\&amp;#039;s worth of the material). There are 19 previously unreleased cuts, mostly tracks recorded for BBC sessions (and there\\&amp;#039;s also the famous bootleg of Chuck Berry\\&amp;#039;s \\&quot;Nadine\\&quot;). Disc five is all live recordings, which has the added benefit of Lemmy\\&amp;#039;s concert banter (\\&quot;this one is about Los Angeles, I wrote it in England, I was thinking about Italy\\&quot;). Featuring Lemmy\\&amp;#039;s involvement every step of the way, Stone Deaf Forever! is a definitive introduction for newcomers and, thanks to the terrific rarities, a gift for hardcore fans as well. \n\n\n~ Marc Greilsamer, amazon.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:237b16344caed593f0f05afda96d7d6b2dfb18da","amp;dn":"Motorhead+-+Stone+Deaf+Forever%21+5CD+Box+Set+%282003%29+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"237b16344caed593f0f05afda96d7d6b2dfb18da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,123,22,52,76,174,213,147,240,240,90,253,169,109,125,107,45,251,24,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
