SEALION, the German invasion plan, provoked the construction of pillboxes, coastal defences, heavy-gun emplacements and anti-aircraft batteries, as well as the formation of the Home Guard and covert groups. Later, new dangers replaced SEALION: radar detection systems were expanded during the Blitz years, as were intelligence-gathering systems and listening posts. From 1944, Britain was again faced with a deadly threat, Hitler's 'Vengeance weapons'. This title provides a concise assessment of Britain's defensive systems, and presents a vivid picture of war on the home front","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d6802913a1fc461e381fbe13b55d61cd5cad866","amp;dn":"British+Home+Defences+1940-45","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d6802913a1fc461e381fbe13b55d61cd5cad866","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,104,2,145,58,31,196,97,227,129,251,225,59,85,214,28,213,202,216,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
