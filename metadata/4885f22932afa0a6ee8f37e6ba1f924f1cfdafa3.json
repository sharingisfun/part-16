They have gained an international underground following, especially in France and Switzerland. There is even a group of French fans called Les Cousins Fringants (a take on the expression cousin that the French use to affectionately call French Canadians). They hail from the MontrÃƒÂ©al suburb of Repentigny, Quebec. The entire band collaborates on the lyrics, although guitarist Jean-FranÃƒÂ§ois PauzÃƒÂ© often contributes more than the others. The fundamental aspect of the band are their explosive live performances, captured on the Attache ta tuque live album and the Centre Bell 30 dÃƒÂ©cembre 2003 DVD.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4885f22932afa0a6ee8f37e6ba1f924f1cfdafa3","amp;dn":"Les+Cowboys+Fringants","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4885f22932afa0a6ee8f37e6ba1f924f1cfdafa3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,133,242,41,50,175,160,166,238,143,55,230,186,31,146,79,28,253,175,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
