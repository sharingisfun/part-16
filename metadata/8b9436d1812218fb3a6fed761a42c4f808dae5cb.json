It was mainly composed and arranged by the legendary Cuban pianist Bebo ValdÃƒÂ©s.\n\n Besides Bebo Valdes, several artists took part on this project. Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Chano Pozo, Ben Webster, Nat Ã¢â‚¬Å“KingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Cole, and Tito Puente are some of the artists whose images have cameo appearances throughout the film. Their instrumentals are played on the soundtrack by a first rate cast of musicians including Jimmy Heath (Webster), Michael Philip Mossman (Gillespie), IrakereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s GermÃƒÂ¡n Velazco (Parker) and Freddy Cole (Nat King Cole). Flamenco star singer Estrella Morente plays herself. ValdÃƒÂ©s plays piano for his screen counterpart, and Rita is sung by Cuban singer Idania ValdÃƒÂ©s.\n \n Considering Chico &amp; Rita deals with the life of Bebo Valdes, the soundtrack is an essential part of this movie. The 30 tracks included on this album provide a real feeling for the sounds that shaped one of the most important chapters in Latin music. The 1940s defined a time in Latin music when genres such as Mambo and Bolero met American Jazz and the whole big band phenomenon.\n\n This soundtrack captures in a perfect way the development of one of the most important cross-over experiences in Latin music, which was especially defined by the traveling of Cuban musicians between Havana and New York, and ultimately ended up shaping the roots of Afro-Cuban Latin Jazz.\n\n\n\nBebo ValdÃƒÂ©s\n\n Chico &amp; Rita\n\n Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n\n 2011\n\n \n\n  CD / 2011 / 320Kbps\n\n\n Tracklist:\n\n 1.
