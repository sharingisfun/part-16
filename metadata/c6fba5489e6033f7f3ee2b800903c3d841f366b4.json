To express such themes, Edguy sometimes use esoteric and hermetic expressions. Yet some of their songs are light-hearted or comedic (&quot;Das Reh&quot;, &quot;Save Us Now&quot;, &quot;Lavatory Love Machine&quot;, &quot;Life and Times of a Bonus Track&quot;, &quot;Trinidad&quot;. Edguy does not claim to represent any ideology; Tobias Sammet claimed &quot;[the band is] not political and we are not religious; at least there is no key message in our songs telling you what to think in terms of anything&quot;. Edguy also employs lengthy and epic sections in almost every album.\n\nHellfire Club revealed Edguy's interest in experimenting within music by integrating an orchestra into the production. The album featured a variation on Edguy's style, with a less grandiose, more traditional heavy metal approach being embraced. The band's album Rocket Ride features even less symphonic and power metal elements, and is arguably more oriented towards hard rock. Their latest album, Tinnitus Sanctus, contains even more hard rock oriented songs; the obvious lack of double bass drumming is evident, in contrast to Edguy's older albums such as Vain Glory Opera.\n\n\n\n\nQuote:\nAge of the Joker\n\n1. &quot;Robin Hood&quot;   8:24\n2. &quot;Nobody's Hero&quot;   4:31\n3. &quot;Rock of Cashel&quot;   6:18\n4. &quot;Pandora's Box&quot;   6:45\n5. &quot;Breathe&quot;   7:42\n6. &quot;Two Out of Seven&quot;   4:27\n7. &quot;Faces in the Darkness&quot;   5:22\n8. &quot;The Arcane Guild&quot;   4:58\n9. &quot;Fire on the Downline&quot;   5:47\n10. &quot;Behind the Gates to Midnight World&quot;   8:56\n11. &quot;Every Night Without You&quot;   4:52","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6fba5489e6033f7f3ee2b800903c3d841f366b4","amp;dn":"Edguy+-+Age+of+the+Joker+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6fba5489e6033f7f3ee2b800903c3d841f366b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,251,165,72,158,96,51,247,243,238,43,128,9,3,195,216,65,243,102,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
