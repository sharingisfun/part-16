Forced into manual labor as a POW, he survived 750 days in the jungle working as a slave on the notorious Ã¢â‚¬Å“Death RailwayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and building the Bridge on the River Kwai. Subsequently, he moved to work on a Japanese Ã¢â‚¬Å“hellship,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ his ship was torpedoed, and nearly everyone on board the ship died. Not Urquhart. After five days adrift on a raft in the South China Sea, he was rescued by a Japanese whaling ship.\nHis luck would only get worse as he was taken to Japan and forced to work in a mine near Nagasaki. Two months later, he was just ten miles from ground zero when an atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. In late August 1945, he was freed by the American NavyÃ¢â‚¬â€a living skeletonÃ¢â‚¬â€and had his first wash in three and a half years.\nThis is the extraordinary story of a young man, conscripted at nineteen, who survived not just one, but three encounters with death, any of which should have probably killed him. Silent for over fifty years, this is UrquhartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inspirational tale in his own words. It is as moving as any memoir and as exciting as any great war movie.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A story of almost unimaginable suffering.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (BBC Radio 4)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Riveting, powerful, moving.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (The Observer)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A remarkable memoir.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Financial Times)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“In his memoir, Urquhart employs matter-of-fact prose that is somehow perfectly appropriate to describe the horrors he experienced. Although grateful and positive about the many benefits in his long lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€he describes himself as a lucky manÃ¢â‚¬â€he is angry at the Japanese government's lack of acknowledgment of Japan's wartime abuses, and he feels neglected by his own government. His story makes clear that he has every right to feel that way.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Library Journal)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Memorable, vivid, relentless.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (The Herald [UK])\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Urquhart. imprisoned in the Kanyu camps, forced to build the Death Railway, herded on the 'hell ship' Kachidoki Maru, and forced to work in mines around Nagasaki, is in a survival league of his own.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (The Times [London])\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nAlistair Urquhart was born in 1919 and is the last surviving member of the Scottish regiment the Gordon Highlanders who were captured in Singapore.
