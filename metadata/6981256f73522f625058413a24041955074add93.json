The results of running a Binary Template are much easier to understand and edit than using just the raw hex bytes.\r\n* Binary Templates are easy to write and look similar to C/C++ structs except they may contain if, for, or while statements as well as functions or complex expressions.\r\n* Powerful enough to parse almost any binary file format.\r\n* Can be set to run automatically when files are opened.\r\n* Templates may be shared and a list of templates for download is available in our Template Repository.\r\n\r\n-Analysis Tools - Drill into your Data-\r\nA number of sophisticated tools are included with 010 Editor for analyzing and editing binary files:\r\n\r\n* Full Find, Replace, Find in Files, and Replace in Files functionality for many different data types.\r\n* Powerful Binary Comparison tool for analyzing byte-by-byte differences between two files.\r\n* Use the Histogram tool to count byte occurrences and visualize data.\r\n* Computes Check Sum/Hash Algorithms including CRC-16, CRC-32, Adler32, MD2, MD4, MD5, RIPEMD160, SHA-1, SHA-256, TIGER, etc.\r\n\r\n-Scripting - Automate your Editing-\r\n* Simple or complex editing operations can be automated using a syntax similar to C/C++.\r\n* Features over 300 different functions for operating on data.\r\n* Integrated with Binary Templates to intuitively edit files. Simply assign to variables defined in a Binary Template to modify a file.\r\n* Scripts may be shared and a list of scripts for download is available in our Script Archive.\r\n* Run scripts from the command line with no user interface for batch processing.\r\n\r\n-...plus much more-\r\n* Powerful Workspace view including file explorer.\r\n* Convert data between ASCII, EBCDIC, Unicode, UTF-8, etc.\r\n* Inspector allows data to be quickly interpreted in different formats.\r\n* Mark important bytes using Bookmarks.\r\n* Full integrated expression calculator.\r\n* Apply Highlighting rules to identify bytes in a file.\r\n* Import or export data in Intel Hex Format, Motorola S-Records, Hex Text, C/C++/Java Code, Base64, Uuencoding, RTF, or HTML.\r\n* Printing with full print preview, headers, footers, and margins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6981256f73522f625058413a24041955074add93","amp;dn":"SweetScape+010+Editor+v7.0+%2BKeygen-C.R.U.D.E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6981256f73522f625058413a24041955074add93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,129,37,111,115,82,47,98,80,88,65,58,36,4,25,85,7,74,221,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
