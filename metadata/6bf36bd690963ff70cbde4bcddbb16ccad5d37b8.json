Ticket sales boomed - Judy and Liza were signed for a special extra night a week later. Unfortunately, Judy was prone to throat infections and was not in the best of health. Despite this Judy and Liza gave the show their all. Something happened on the stage that night. Out stepped Liza the Woman, the singer, actress, and dancer. She was dealing with the force that was Judy Garland and holding her own. The audience went crazy... Mother and Daughter were a big hit. Judy's wit, humour and affection more than compensated for any visible tiredness. Judy and Liza not only got through but yet again won terrific applause and respect from the audience. A significantly abridged version of the concert was released on an EP and LP from EMI in 1965. The second show was broadcast on Television. Due to technical conditions the telecast recording was poor. The BFI holds an archival print of the event which whilst watchable is badly rendered. Video copies have been released on PAL and NTSC offering very little of the atmosphere and magic of the actual occasion. \n\n      Video #1\n      Format : AVC\n      Format/Info : Advanced Video Codec\n      Format profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;367b575f58767a071805&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n      Format settings, CABAC : Yes\n      Format settings, ReFrames : 1 frame\n      Codec ID : avc1\n      Codec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\n      Duration : 54mn 10s\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 1 172 Kbps\n      Width : 320 pixels\n      Height : 240 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate mode : Constant\n      Frame rate : 29.970 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n     \n      Audio #2\n      Format : AAC\n      Format/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\n      Format version : Version 4\n      Format profile : LC\n      Format settings, SBR : No\n      Codec ID : 40\n      Duration : 54mn 2s\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 44.1 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      \n\n      Enjoy And Seed                                  use  VLC  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bf36bd690963ff70cbde4bcddbb16ccad5d37b8","amp;dn":"Judy+Garland+And+Liza+Minnelli+Live+At+The+London+Palladium%281964","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bf36bd690963ff70cbde4bcddbb16ccad5d37b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,243,107,214,144,150,63,247,12,189,228,188,221,187,22,204,173,93,55,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
