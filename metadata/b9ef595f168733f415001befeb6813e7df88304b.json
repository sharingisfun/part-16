In &quot;HISTORY'S RAIDERS&quot; some of the most exciting and decisive small unit actions have been minutely researched and uncovered with unprecedented access to over 500,000 hours of archive film, much of which will be seen in the series for the first time. \n\nProduced by Nugus / Martin Productions Ltd for the History Channel MMI\n\n\n\nEpisode 16 : The Raids Against the Tirpitz\n\nFor the Germans, the giant battleship Tirpitz was the &quot;Queen of the North&quot; - a constant threat to the vital Allied convoys to Russia. For Churchill, she was &quot;the Beast&quot; - and one which must be destroyed at all cost. For more than three years RAF bombers, Fleet Air Arm dive bombers, and Royal Navy Chariots and X-craft mounted raids until Tirpitz was finally eliminated.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2267 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x528\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 256kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 44:46.411\nNumber Of Parts: 26\nPart Size: 815 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9ef595f168733f415001befeb6813e7df88304b","amp;dn":"HC.History%27s.Raiders.16of26.The.Raids.Against.the.Tirpitz.XviD.A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9ef595f168733f415001befeb6813e7df88304b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,239,89,95,22,135,51,244,21,0,27,239,235,104,19,231,223,136,48,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
