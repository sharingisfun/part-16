The Russian filmmaker,\nPavel Klushantsev, has had an extraordinary influence on an entire genre of\nfilms. Throughout his career at a film studio in St. Petersburg, Klushantsev\npioneered and invented legendary techniques for filming the planets, stars and\nweightlessness - long before anyone else. He went on to redefine the science\nfiction genre and influence the way Hollywood made their science fiction films.&quot;\n\n&quot;The first but, it is hoped, not the last documentary on Russian science fiction\ncinema pioneer Pavel Klushantsev. Danish featurette Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Star DreamerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has a\nfascinating subject to which it only does partial justice, overselling the\nvictim-of-Soviet-bureaucracy angle while providing too narrow a glimpse at his\nscreen career. Still, it is worthwhile for the clips from KlushantsevÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s major\nworks. Fantasy oriented fest and tube programmers should take note.&quot;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0339723/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0339723/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Klushantsev&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Klushantsev&lt;/a&gt;\n\n419 MB, 00h52m21s, 25.000 fps\nDivX 5.x/6.x @ 979 kbps\nMPEG-1 Layer 3 @ 128 kbps tot (joint stereo)\n720X576, sar 1.250 (5:4)\n\noriginal Russian and English audio, hardcoded English subtitles when needed\n(subtitle copyright SBS Australia 2004, indicating TVRip, quality watchable)\n\n\nNote - Windows Media Player 9 and VLC both play this file perfectly well, but\nfor some reason my Media Player Classic just thinks about it and fails.\n\nscreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KaHmkAafP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KaHmkAafP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KAhMlAAFP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KAhMlAAFP&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b93f4d894584a455f6534f95fd0d897fcf956496","amp;dn":"The+Star+Dreamer+-+Pavel+Klushantsev+biography+%28SciFi+2002%29+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b93f4d894584a455f6534f95fd0d897fcf956496","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,63,77,137,69,132,164,85,246,83,79,149,253,13,137,127,207,149,100,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
