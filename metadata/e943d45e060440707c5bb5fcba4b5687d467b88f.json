The album - the first for his new record label, Warner Bros. Records, following an acrimonious departure from Virgin Records after twenty years - was conceived as a sequel to Oldfield's 1973 Tubular Bells.\n\nTubular Bells II partly follows musical\nstructures of the original Tubular Bells (1973). Themes of the original Bells are taken and then completely re-composed and played with mostly new instruments. The result is an album that has same kind of thematic variation but is still new musically. Some themes can be seen as variations of themes taken from the original Bells, while some other parts of Tubular Bells II do not have much common with the themes of the original album except their overall mood or feeling.\n\nUnlike Tubular Bells there is a recurring theme, first appearing at the end of &quot;Sentinel&quot; that reappears throughout the album, though it is most obvious at the end of &quot;The Bell&quot;.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
