The artwork still features the Detroit MC's childhood home Ã¢â‚¬â€ harking back to 2000's The Marshall Mathers LP but with a foreclosed-upon twist Ã¢â‚¬â€ but this time we're one step removed from the scene. Cleverly, the new image seats the old one within the window view looking out from a locked luxury vehicle.\n\nThe image of the back contains the amended track list, which throws in five extra songs, including collaborations with &quot;Diamonds&quot; co-author Sia (&quot;Beautiful Pain&quot;) and blues-rock Brit Jamie N Commons (&quot;Desperation&quot;). In related news, we've so far heard &quot;Rap God,&quot; &quot;Survival,&quot; and &quot;Berzerk.&quot;\n\nRelease Date: Nov. 5th, 2013\n? 2013 Aftermath Records\n\nTracklist:\n1. Bad Guy\n2. Parking Lot (Skit)\n3. Rhyme or Reason\n4. So Much Better\n5. Survival\n6. Legacy\n7. A*****e (feat. Skylar Grey)\n8. Berzerk\n9. Rap God\n10. Brainless\n11. Stronger Than I Was\n12.
