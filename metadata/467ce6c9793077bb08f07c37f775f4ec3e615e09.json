The format is simple: short segments on virtually all of the great pianists who have ever been captured on film, augmented by extracts from interviews, sometimes with the pianists themselves, or with later conductors and musicians of international stature, including specially filmed contributions from Daniel Barenboim, Sir Colin Davis, Evgeny Kissin, Gennadi Rozhdestvensky, and TamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡sÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ry. The narration by John Tusa offers an overview of piano music through the century, though the heart of the film is the great quantity of rare archive historic footage, with extracts from performances by Gould, Horowitz, Paderwski, Rachmaninoff, Richter, Rubinstein, and many others. The interviews are short, but offer considerable insight, while the film of so many revered pianists brought together is a literal eye-opener, especially for those who have previously only known these masters from LP and CD. This is, like the companion program The Art of Singing, as close to definitive as a single film can get, even going so far as to include footage from the &quot;silent&quot; era with sound from corresponding recordings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:467ce6c9793077bb08f07c37f775f4ec3e615e09","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Piano+-+Great+Pianists+of+20th+Century+%281999%29+%5BDVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"467ce6c9793077bb08f07c37f775f4ec3e615e09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,124,230,201,121,48,119,187,8,240,124,55,247,117,244,236,62,97,94,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
