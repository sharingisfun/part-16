Victory over the Armada proved a turning point in the nation's story as tiny, impoverished England was transformed into a seafaring nation, one whose future wealth and power lay on the oceans. The ruthless exploits of Elizabethan seafaring heroes like Francis Drake created a potent new sense of national identity that combined patriotism and Protestantism with private profiteering.\n\nAt sea and on land, Snow shows how the Navy became an indispensable tool of state, weaving the stories of characters like Drake, God's Republican warrior at sea Robert Blake, and Samuel Pepys, administrator par excellence, who laid the foundations for Britain's modern civil service.\n\nWith access to the modern Navy and reconstructed ships of the time, Snow recounts the Navy's metamorphosis from a rabble of West Country freebooters to possibly the most complex industrial enterprise on earth.\n\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.0\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 59 minutes\nNumber Of Parts: 4\nPart Size: 1.70GB\nSubtitles: merged\nRipped by: JungleBoy\nSource: DVB-S\n\nforums[dot]mvgroup[dot]org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c4f4c23a38bd394d6c9c870852f3f7f3c56dffa","amp;dn":"BBC+Empire+of+the+Seas+1of4+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c4f4c23a38bd394d6c9c870852f3f7f3c56dffa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,79,76,35,163,139,211,148,214,201,200,112,133,47,63,127,60,86,223,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
