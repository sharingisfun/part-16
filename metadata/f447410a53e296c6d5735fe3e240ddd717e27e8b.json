This book explores all key aspects of the development of this ancient culture, including the ecology of the region and its famously productive agriculture, its political and economic standing, its religious practices, and the achievements of its intelligentsia.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f447410a53e296c6d5735fe3e240ddd717e27e8b","amp;dn":"Babylonian+World+%28History+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f447410a53e296c6d5735fe3e240ddd717e27e8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,71,65,10,83,226,150,198,213,115,95,227,226,64,221,215,23,226,126,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
