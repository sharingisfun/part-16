Editing, modeling, and texturing tools allow you to further edit, \nrefine, and texture your rendered objects. Your 3D objects can then be exported \ninto different formats.\n\n=========================================\nOVERVIEW\n=========================================\nAutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® ImageModelerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ image-based modeling software enables architects, \ndesigners, and entertainment content creators to quickly and easily create \n3D models from 2D digital images or panoramas.\n\nUse ImageModeler to capture the reality as-built:\n\n    * Reconstruct photorealistic objects, scenes, and cities\n    * Integrate CAD projects with existing environments\n    * Take measurements of buildings\n\nThe softwareÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s easy-to-learn, three-step workflowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½calibration, modeling, and \ntexturingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½lets you achieve, stunning, photorealistic modeling with real-world \naccuracy. Additionally, ImageModeler 2009 offers support for AutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 3ds MaxÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, \nAutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® MayaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, and AutoCADÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® software.\n\nCalibration\nCalibrate the software for one to many pictures by matching a few \npoints between the images. There is no need to input information \nabout the camera.\n\nModeling\nThe modeling tools in ImageModeler are simple. A 3D model is \ngenerated using polygonal primitives. This model can then be \nrefined by the user and detail added.\n\nTexturing\nPhotorealistic texture maps are automatically extracted from the \npixel information of the source images. \n\nOverview\nAutodesk ImageModeler offers an easy-to-learn, three-step \nworkflowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½calibration, modeling, and texturingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ enabling you to \nquickly create 3D models from 2D photographs.\n\n=========================================\nFEATURES\n=========================================\nImageModeler features include a powerful calibration engine, a \n3D measurement toolset for calculating real-world distances and \nangles, and high-performance texture extraction.\n\n\n=========================================\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n=========================================\n\nSoftware Recommendations\n\nAutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® ImageModelerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ 2009 software is supported on the \nfollowing operating systems:\n\n    * MicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP Professional, (SP2 or higher) 32-bit operating system\n    * MicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Windows VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Business, (SP1) 32-bit operating system \n\nImageModeler 2009 documentation is compatible with any \nof the following browsers:\n\n    * MicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Internet ExplorerÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 6.0 or higher\n    * MozillaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® FirefoxÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, version 2.0 or higher\n\nTo be able to load panoramas in AppleÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® QuickTimeÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® format (.mov), \nthe following software is required:\n\n    * Apple QuickTime 7\n\nHardware Recommendations\n\nAt a minimum, ImageModeler 2009 software requires a system \nwith the following hardware: \n\n    * IntelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® PentiumÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 4 processor (equivalent or later), 1 GHz or faster\n    * 512 MB RAM for Windows XP / 1 GB RAM for Windows Vista (2 GB recommended)\n    * 200 MB free hard drive space (2 GB recommended)\n    * Ethernet adapter\n    * Qualified hardware-accelerated OpenGLÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 1.2 professional graphics card with latest graphics driver available on vendorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s site.\n    * Two-button mouse with mouse driver software \n\n\n=========================================\nINSTALLATION\n=========================================\nSee &quot;readme.txt&quot; in the Crack folder.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:422bef371bd4dffc86052af4b1cb74eae8b0800a","amp;dn":"Autodesk+Image+Modeler%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2+2009+32bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"422bef371bd4dffc86052af4b1cb74eae8b0800a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,43,239,55,27,212,223,252,134,5,42,244,177,203,116,234,232,176,128,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
