This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nThere is a song by the only woman in chart history (other than Roberta Flack) to have number one hits in three consecutive years.\n\nFanny was the first ever all-girl band (according to Casey) and they are at number 30 with &quot;Butter Boy.&quot;\n\nCasey tells how the band Earth, Wind &amp; Fire (at number 25 with &quot;Shining Star&quot;) got its name.\n\nA listener wants to know what recording act has had number 1 songs on more different labels than anyone else. Casey reports the most phenomenal group in the history of music has had number 1's on four different labels (the first 3 in just three months).\n\nThere is a song that only one week earlier became the slowest moving record of the rock era. It finally hit number 1 after three-and-a-half months climbing the hot 100.\n\n40: Killer Queen - Queen\n39: Tangled Up In Blue - Bob Dylan\n38: Best Of My Love - Eagles\n37: To The Door Of The Sun - Al Martino\n36: Can't Get It Out Of My Head - Electric Light Orchestra\n35: Emotion - Helen Reddy\n34: It's A Miracle - Barry Manilow\n33: He Don't Love You (Like I Love You) - Tony Orlando &amp; Dawn\n32: Jackie Blue - Ozark Mountain Daredevils\n31: The Bertha Butt Boogie - Jimmy Castor Bunch\n30: Butter Boy - Fanny\n29: The South's Gonna Do It Again - Charlie Daniels Band\n28: Long Tall Glasses - Leo Sayer\n27: What Am I Gonna Do With You - Barry White\n26: Satin Soul - Love Unlimited Orchestra\n25: Shining Star - Earth, Wind &amp; Fire\n24: L-O-V-E (Love) - Al Green\n23: Lady - Styx\n22: Walking In Rhythm - Blackbyrds\n21: Before The Next Teardrop Falls - Freddy Fender\n20: Supernatural Thing - Ben E.
