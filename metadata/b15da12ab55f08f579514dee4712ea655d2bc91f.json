The isometric gameplay is team based and unlike any fighting game or MOBA you've played before. Combat is fast-paced, precise and merciless, resulting in a competitive environment where skills matter. There is no auto-attacking or hand-holding â€“ every shot is a skill-shot!\r\n\r\nSurviving in the Wild West will not be easy. Youâ€™ll be squaring off against the deadliest outlaws in 3v3 shootouts and 1v1 duels. Itâ€™s your ability to out maneuver your opponent (range control, timing, accuracy), your cunning team play, and your strategic use of the environment that will determine whether you collect the bounty on your enemies heads or they collect yours.\r\n\r\nThe â€œMost Wanted Editionâ€ brings a heavily expanded version of Secret Ponchos to Steam. Switchblade Monkeys, the indie developers behind Secret Ponchos (thatâ€™s us!), are a small group of friends that have been building Secret Ponchos from their homes for the last 6 years. They worked closely over this last year with the Early Access community to refine features, and add more than double the gameâ€™s content (including an enhanced character roster, new maps, and all-new game modes) and are now proud to present the official release. &quot;The Most Wanted Edition&quot; of Secret Ponchos was showcased at EVO 2015 this year, and received an incredibly strong reception from the competitive community","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b15da12ab55f08f579514dee4712ea655d2bc91f","amp;dn":"Secret+Ponchos+v1.002","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b15da12ab55f08f579514dee4712ea655d2bc91f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,93,161,42,181,95,8,245,121,81,77,238,71,18,234,101,93,43,201,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
