In a place dominated by blue bloods and their inherited wealth, along with the nouveau riche, there arc surprisingly few rules of engagement, and Stone finds himself navigating a dangerous course, one where even the most expensive and sought-after status symbols are sometimes stolen and sometimes clever fakes, though no less priceless.\n \nWith its swift action, bold characters, and wit as dry as the best martini, &quot;Hot Mahogany&quot; is another must-read from the pen of a master entertainer.\n\nSTUART WOODS is the author of thirty-eight novels, including the New York Times-bestselling Stone Barrington series and Holly Barker series. An avid pilot and sailor, he divides his time among New York City, Florida, and Maine.\n\nTONY ROBERTS is a gifted actor who has appeared on the Broadway stage and in films. Twice a Tony nominee, he has starred in &quot;Xanadu&quot;, &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot;, &quot;Don't Drink the Water&quot;, and &quot;Victor, Victoria&quot;. His film credits include &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, &quot;Serpico&quot;, and &quot;Play It Again, Sam&quot;. He can be heard on several Stone Barrington audiobooks.\n\nApproximately 8 hours from 7 CDs in MP3 format.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a07773640cb3debf27351b4c441c46d34604e728","amp;dn":"Stuart+Woods+-+Hot+Mahogany","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a07773640cb3debf27351b4c441c46d34604e728","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,119,115,100,12,179,222,191,39,53,27,76,68,28,70,211,70,4,231,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
