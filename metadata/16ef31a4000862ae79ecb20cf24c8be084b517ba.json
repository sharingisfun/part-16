The limitations of the DS are made more apparent when you start playing however as the AI is fairly atrocious and enemies don\\'t react very realistically when shot.\n \nAir support areas - where you move around with the D-Pad and tap on the touch screen to tell ground units where to move - are sluggish and limited, but these niggles aside it\\'s a half-decent DS shooter with some fun online multiplayer for up to six players.\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16ef31a4000862ae79ecb20cf24c8be084b517ba","amp;dn":"Call+of+Duty+Modern+Warfare+3+Defiance+Nintendo+DS+.nds+MW3+-THE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16ef31a4000862ae79ecb20cf24c8be084b517ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,239,49,164,0,8,98,174,121,236,178,12,242,76,139,224,132,181,23,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
