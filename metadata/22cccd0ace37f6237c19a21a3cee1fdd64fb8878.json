Because of a 30-pound weight gain and multiple reconstructive surgeries on her breasts, Erin is dealing with both physical and emotional scars. Can Stacy and Clinton awaken Erin's confidence and make her feel like a secure, stylish and sexy woman? Or will she write off their style suggestions and sink into further despair?\n\nMediaInfo:\nGeneral\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 516 MiB\nDuration                         : 42mn 18s\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 705 Kbps\nWriting application              : Lavf52.39.0\nWriting library                  : VirtualDub build 32842/release\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : DX50\nCodec ID/Hint                    : DivX 5\nDuration                         : 42mn 18s\nBit rate                         : 1 500 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 448 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.607\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.186\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 42mn 18s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 58.1 MiB (11%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22cccd0ace37f6237c19a21a3cee1fdd64fb8878","amp;dn":"What.Not.To.Wear+s08e10+Erin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22cccd0ace37f6237c19a21a3cee1fdd64fb8878","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,204,205,10,206,55,246,35,124,25,162,26,60,238,31,221,100,251,136,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
