The gameplay is based on fully interactive physics where each character's different abilities and tactics can be used to invent new ways to overcome obstacles and save the kingdom!\n\nThe single-player game is fantastic fun, but Trine is one of those games best played with a friend in co-op mode. Finding solutions in a synergy of different character skills, perfectly timing your actions, and solving puzzles together with your co-op partner is the kind of truly rewarding feeling that only the best co-op games can elicit.\n\nMany indie games get by with a minimalist approach to graphics and audio, making a virtue of limited resources and focusing solely on gameplay. Trine is not one of those games. It has stunning visuals and captivating audio; together, they create an enchanting combination that is almost hypnotically beautiful. Trine is a very unique experience, a slick combination of puzzle and platformer games with brilliantly executed co-operative mode.This is a great choice for anyone looking for a game that is not only fun and eye-candy but also keeps your brain pleasantly occupied. \n\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.\n\nWAITING ON THE REQUEST LIST TO BE UPLOADED:\n\nFAR CRY\nFAR CRY 2: FORTUNE'S EDITION\nMEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT WAR CHEST\t\nGOTHIC 1, 2, 3\nIN COLD BLOOD\n\n--------------\nREQUESTS THAT I CAN'T FULLFILL AT THE MOMENT\n\nLeisure Suit Larry Language Pack\nDon't Starve\nKing of Dragon Pass\nGalactic Civilizations I Ultimate Edition\nThe Cat Lady\n\n--------------\n\nIF POSSIBLE, DON'T FORGET TO SUPPORT THE COMPANIES AND GOG.COM FOR THEIR GREAT SERVICE.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5590db4ebcbbb577e88f17578adbfaba8c023c4","amp;dn":"Trine+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5590db4ebcbbb577e88f17578adbfaba8c023c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,89,13,180,235,203,187,87,126,136,241,117,120,173,191,171,168,192,35,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
