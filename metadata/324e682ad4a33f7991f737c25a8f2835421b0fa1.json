Renewable Resources and Renewable Energy: A Global Challenge presents a well-rounded perspective on the development of bio-based feedstocks, biodegradable plastics, hydrogen energy, fuel cells, and other aspects related to renewable resources and sustainable energy production.\r\n\r\nThe book first examines the transformation of bio-based renewable feedstock into valuable, clean, and economically attractive products. It explains the catalytic processes involved and surveys the relevant commercial technologies that are available. The book highlights how these technologies can be used for efficient waste management solutions, particularly for the synthetic polymers industry, as well as energy production. The authors also pay particular attention to current trends for hydrogen-based and fuel cell-based technologies and provide real-world case studies of renewable energy projects in Asia and South America.\r\n\r\nAn accessible reference for both scientists and non-scientists, Renewable Resources and Renewable Energy offers valuable insight into the chemical processes and practical considerations as well as the advantages, challenges, and opportunities for developing these technologies and achieving more sustainable energy production","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:324e682ad4a33f7991f737c25a8f2835421b0fa1","amp;dn":"Renewable+Resources+and+Renewable+Energy+-+A+Global+Challenge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"324e682ad4a33f7991f737c25a8f2835421b0fa1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,78,104,42,212,163,63,121,145,247,55,194,90,143,40,53,66,27,15,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
