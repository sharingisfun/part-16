John Byrne wrote and illustrated this series, with inks by Doug Hazlewood. Touted as &quot;Together again for the first time!&quot;, Byrne rebooted the series, eliminating the continuity that dated back to the Silver Age.\n\nThis also retroactively eliminated Beast Boy&amp;#039;s origins and numerous important Doom Patrol appearances, including the reunions of Beast Boy (then called Changeling) and Robotman in the 1980s New Teen Titans and the team&amp;#039;s important role in JLA: Year One. It also angered some of Morrison&amp;#039;s fans, but DC editors argued that the team&amp;#039;s classic line-up should be supported, especially since attempts to continue the Morrison/Vertigo continuity had proven unsuccessful. However, DC cancelled Byrne&amp;#039;s series with issue #18.\n\nThis reboot was both controversial and short-lived. The events in DC&amp;#039;s Infinite Crisis crossover saw the restoration of the Doom Patrol&amp;#039;s full continuity, with the history of all previous incarnations, excluding Byrne&amp;#039;s reboot.\n\nThanks to the scanners and the original sources\n\nPlease seed. Please enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e777784a92fffe418f64e7132453d0cb52b1593c","amp;dn":"Doom+Patrol+v3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e777784a92fffe418f64e7132453d0cb52b1593c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,119,120,74,146,255,254,65,143,100,231,19,36,83,208,203,82,177,89,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
