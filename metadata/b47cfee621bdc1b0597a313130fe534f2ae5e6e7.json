Written in a non-sensational manner, this authoritative encyclopaedia debunks many of the myths surrounding this most notorious of criminal activities.

Completely updated entries and appendixes pair with more than 30 new photographs and many new entries to make this new edition more fascinating than ever. New and updated entries include: &quot;Axe Man of New Orleans&quot;; BTK Strangler; Jack the Ripper; Cuidad Juarez, Mexico; John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo, the Sniper Killers; Gary Leon Ridgway, the Green River Killer; and Harold Frederick Shipman.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b47cfee621bdc1b0597a313130fe534f2ae5e6e7","amp;dn":"The+Encyclopedia+of+Serial+Killers+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b47cfee621bdc1b0597a313130fe534f2ae5e6e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,124,254,230,33,189,193,176,89,122,49,49,48,254,83,79,42,229,230,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
