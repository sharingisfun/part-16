Well, straighter. Although heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s happy to run alcohol guns wherever the moneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s good, he doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t think the world needs more sap, or its increasingly ugly side-effects. But becoming legit is easier said than done, and ClyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first legal gig -- a supply run for the Seattle Underground -- will be paid for by sap money. New Orleans is not ClyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first pick for a shopping run. He loved the Big Easy once, back when he also loved a beautiful mixed-race prostitute named Josephine Early -- but that was a decade ago, and he hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t looked back since.\n\nJoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s still thinking about him, though, or so he learns when he gets a telegram about a peculiar piloting job. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a chance to complete two lucrative jobs at once, one he canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t refuse. He sends his old paramour a note and heads for New Orleans, with no idea of what heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in for -- or what she wants him to fly.\n\nBut he wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be flying. Not exactly. Hidden at the bottom of Lake Pontchartrain lurks an astonishing war machine, an immense submersible called the Ganymede. This prototype could end the war, if only anyone had the faintest idea of how to operate it.... If only they could sneak it past the Southern forces at the mouth of the Mississippi River... If only it hadnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t killed most of the men whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d ever set foot inside it. But itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s those &quot;if onlys&quot; that will decide whether Cly and his crew will end up in the history books, or at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nUnabridged.\nRead by Edoardo Ballerini\n\n-------------------------------------\nVisit us for this and loads more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws\n\n-------------------------------------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28bd4bc1b5434b7160c5d339c6f5da5058305aed","amp;dn":"Ganymede+-+Cherie+Priest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28bd4bc1b5434b7160c5d339c6f5da5058305aed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,189,75,193,181,67,75,113,96,197,211,57,198,245,218,80,88,48,90,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
