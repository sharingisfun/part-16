But the seemingly quiet community is not as it appears, as the detective uncovers a secretive pagan society led by the strange Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee). While the townsfolk tempt and threaten him with bizarre rituals and wanton lust, Howie must race to discover the truth behind the girl's disappearance before his clash with Lord Summerisle builds to a terrifying conclusion - one that has cemented this cult shocker as a modern horror masterpiece.\n\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070917 (the original 1973 version)\n\n---\n\nMedia info:\nFORMAT....................: MP4\nCODEC.....................: h264\nGENRE.....................: Horror, Mystery\nFILE SIZE.................: 893 MB (893 527 KB)\nRESOLUTION................: 720x552\nFRAME RATE................: 25 fps\nAUDIO FORMAT..............: MPEG AAC (MP4A) 48000Hz, 128kbit/s\nLANGUAGE..................: English\nSUBTITLES.................: English (embedded, not hardcoded)\nPUBLISHER.................: Lions Gate (original 1973, Final Cut version 2013)\n\n---\n\nComment:\nI made this rip from the 2013 &quot;The Final Cut&quot; DVD box. I think the quality is pretty good. Bear in mind that this is an old movie, and at certain parts of the film, the quality is quite blurry and far worse than usual. I made an encoding which took roughly 12 hours, and I am no expert on video really; but I think I might have made the worse parts a bit less blurry. Not sure though.\n\nIn any case, this is one of those heathen themed cult classics, that you just have to watch at least once every year. If you never even saw it, you have missed a lot!\nAbout the &quot;Final Cut&quot;: Can't tell much difference in the story line (etc.) between this one and the Director's cut version. Those are both better than the first UK Theatrical version I guess.\n\nHaven't seen this one around much, so I felt it was appropriate with a decent rip. If you share and seed like good little boys and girls, I'll make the rest of the box set available too.\n\nShare and seed until RagnarÃƒÂ¶k!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dbfac33ca36a663fe7bc4f6fbbac3b197c32d9b","amp;dn":"The+Wicker+Man+-+The+Final+Cut.2013.DVD-Rip.%5BDerHammer%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dbfac33ca36a663fe7bc4f6fbbac3b197c32d9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,191,172,51,202,54,166,99,254,123,196,246,251,186,195,177,151,195,45,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
