After being attacked by an octopus and losing their raft, they wash up on the shores of Spain. After harassing the waitresses at a local sidewalk cafÃƒÂ©, they insult the owner and wind up in a bull ring as punishment. In the midst of fighting dozens of bulls, they receive a telegram that Prohibition has been repealed back in the U.S. They immediately leave Spain headed back to the U.S. for a drink. \n\nDirectors:\nJohn Foster, Vernon Stallings (as George Stallings) \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0152550/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0152550/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c723be60b64a5d5ca75446f824688b7a72559eb","amp;dn":"Tom+and+Jerry-A+SpanishTwist%281932%29%28avi%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c723be60b64a5d5ca75446f824688b7a72559eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,114,59,230,11,100,165,213,202,117,68,111,130,70,136,183,167,37,89,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
