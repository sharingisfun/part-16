The film tells a very simply story of friendship between an artistic, sensitive seven-year-old violinist named Sasha and a physical, blue-collar steamroller operator. They befriend each other after Sasha is threatened by some ruffians, spend the day together, and alter each other&amp;#039;s perceptions of life.\nPerry Seibert\n\nA voice from IMDB\n\nSTEAMROLLER AND VIOLIN represents the conclusion of my long search to see every one of Andrei Tarkovsky&amp;#039;s accessible films of his sparse catalogue. Does the movie hold up to all the other films that Tarkovsky has done? Well, not quite. Nevertheless, the film does highlight the use of several techniques typical of Russian film: split screens, montage, and experimentation of sound. It&amp;#039;s also a foretaste of things to come, highlighting Tarkovsky&amp;#039;s unique style starting with his first, full-length movie, IVAN&amp;#039;S CHILDHOOD. Overall, an interesting achievement.\n\nNOT MY RIP\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
