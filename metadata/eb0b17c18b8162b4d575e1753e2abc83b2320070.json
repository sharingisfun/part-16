Far beyond their customary utilitarian function, they have been used in symbolic and sacred contexts and also as emblems of wealth and status.\r\n\r\nThe hub of trading systems, ancient Indonesia was a pathway for religious and artistic influences, dispersing exotic patterns and forms from many cultures throughout its myriad island populations. Images deeply embedded in ancient traditions combined with designs from other Asian civilizations to create a rich iconographic tradition that celebrates a cosmology founded on revered ancestors and supernatural presences.\r\n\r\nUsing nineteenth- and early twentieth-century textiles as the vehicle to explore the central issue of iconographic origins, art historians Robert J. Holmgren and Anita E. Spertus have examined the many-layered complexities of Indonesian pattern and form.
