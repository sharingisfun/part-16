Goode\nHear My Train A Comin'\nStar Spangeled Banner\nPurple Haze\nHey Baby (New Rising Sun)\nLover Man\nI Don't Live Today\nMachine Gun\nVoodoo Child (Slight Return)\nBonus:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The Second Set (1:07:28) contains the entire performance of Jimi's second set at Berkeley on May 30, 1970. This ostensibly audio only supplement plays to some appropriately psychedelic imagery filling the menu screen in 1080p. There are two audio options here, a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track which streams at an average rate of around 5.0 mbps (sometimes a bit more, sometimes a bit less) and an uncompressed LPCM 5.1 mix which holds steady at 6.9 mbps.\nThe set list features:\nPass It On (Straight Ahead)\nHey Baby (New Rising Sun)\nLover Man\nStone Free\nHey Joe\nI Don't Live Today\nMachine Gun\nFoxy Lady\nStar Spangled Banner\nPurple Haze\nVoodoo Child (Slight Return)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Abe Jacob Interview (HD; 7:51) features reminiscences from Jacob (the menu lists his surname incorrectly as Jacobs), who did sound at the Monterey Pop Festival, as well as a slew of great Broadway shows (the first Broadway show I saw as a kid was Pippin, featuring Jacob's stellar work). Jacob was soon hired to do sound for Hendrix while they were on tour and he has some great, often funny, anecdotes to share..\n\n\nÃÅ¡ÃÂ°Ã‘â€¡ÃÂµÃ‘ï¿½Ã‘â€šÃÂ²ÃÂ¾: Blu-ray\nÃÅ¡ÃÂ¾ÃÂ½Ã‘â€šÃÂµÃÂ¹ÃÂ½ÃÂµÃ‘â‚¬: BDMV\nÃâ€™ÃÂ¸ÃÂ´ÃÂµÃÂ¾ ÃÂºÃÂ¾ÃÂ´ÃÂµÃÂº: AVC\nÃï¿½Ã‘Æ’ÃÂ´ÃÂ¸ÃÂ¾ ÃÂºÃÂ¾ÃÂ´ÃÂµÃÂº: DTS, PCM\nÃâ€™ÃÂ¸ÃÂ´ÃÂµÃÂ¾: MPEG-4 AVC 17974 kbps 1920*1080p / 23.976 fps / 16:9 / High Profile 4.1\nÃï¿½Ã‘Æ’ÃÂ´ÃÂ¸ÃÂ¾#1: English DTS-HD MA 5.1 / 48 kHz / 4613 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 24-bit)\nÃï¿½Ã‘Æ’ÃÂ´ÃÂ¸ÃÂ¾#2: English LPCM 2.0 / 48 kHz / 2304 kbps / 24-bit","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:058797bdc361a860c0b3efaef39ec8d5aea0f71e","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix+-+Plays+Berkeley+Bluray","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"058797bdc361a860c0b3efaef39ec8d5aea0f71e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,135,151,189,195,97,168,96,192,179,239,174,243,158,200,213,174,160,247,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
