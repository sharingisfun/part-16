Led by vocalist Dolores O'Riordan, whose keening, powerful voice is the most distinctive element of the group's sound, the group initially made little impact in the United Kingdom. It wasn't until the lush ballad &quot;Linger&quot; became an American hit in 1993 that the band also achieved mass success in the U.K. Following the success of &quot;Linger,&quot; the Cranberries quickly became international stars, as both their 1993 debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?, and its 1994 follow-up, No Need to Argue, sold millions of copies and produced a string of hit singles. By the time of their third album, 1996's To the Faithful Departed, they had added distorted guitars to their sonic palette and attempted to make more socially significant music, which resulted in a downturn in the band's commercial fortunes.\n\n  During the fall of 1996, the group canceled its Australian and European tour, sparking another round of rumors about whether O'Riordan was about to launch a solo career. In 1999, the group released Bury the Hatchet, and in 2003, shortly after the release of a greatest-hits compilation, Stars: The Best of 1992-2002, the Cranberries officially declared that they were taking a break. This finally gave O'Riordan the time she needed to work on her long-talked-about solo album, and Are You Listening hit shelves in 2007. In 2009, O'Riordan released her second solo album, No Baggage. Around the same time, the Cranberries reunited for a North American tour that continued throughout Europe in 2010. Several live albums also appeared in 2010. In 2011, the band began work on a new album in Toronto with longtime producer Street. The resulting album, Roses, appeared in March 2012.\n\n*Special thanks to KitLope for his rip.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:128b5c41a6bd8b8be21bdc16188b4f3a81fd95f1","amp;dn":"The+Cranberries+-+Studio+Discography+%281993-2012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"128b5c41a6bd8b8be21bdc16188b4f3a81fd95f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,139,92,65,166,189,139,139,226,27,220,22,24,139,79,58,129,253,149,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
