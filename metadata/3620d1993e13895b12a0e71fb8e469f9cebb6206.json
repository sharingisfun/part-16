While there are many answers to the question of &quot;what went wrong&quot; in the Muslim world, no one has decisively answered why it went wrong. Until now.\n\nIn this eye-opening new book, foreign policy expert Robert R. Reilly uncovers the root of our contemporary crisis: a pivotal struggle waged within the Muslim world nearly a millennium ago. In a heated battle over the role of reason, the side of irrationality won. The deformed theology that resulted, Reilly reveals, produced the spiritual pathology of Islamism, and a deeply dysfunctional culture.\n\nAuthor: Robert Reilly\nPublisher: Dialog Press\nPublication Date: November 16, 2010\n\nFormats:\n.mobi (compatible with Amazon Kindle, etc.)\n.epub (compatible with Sony Reader, Cruz Reader, iPad, iPodTouch/iPhone, etc.)\n\nFree Calibre eBook reader: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3620d1993e13895b12a0e71fb8e469f9cebb6206","amp;dn":"Robert+Reilly+-+The+Closing+of+the+Muslim+Mind+%28mobi%2C+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3620d1993e13895b12a0e71fb8e469f9cebb6206","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,32,209,153,62,19,137,91,18,160,231,31,184,228,105,249,206,187,98,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
