In The Asylum, an unabashedly hilarious collection of autobiographical essays, Doonan, the creative ambassador for Barneys New York, tells the real-life stories of glamorous madness and stylish insanity.  Doonan has witnessed models unable to work for fear of ghosts, gone deep-sea fishing with a couturier pal and his jailbird companion, and watched Anna Wintour remain perfectly calm while the ceiling fellÃ¢â‚¬â€literallyÃ¢â‚¬â€in the middle of Fashion Week. Once you start looking, he says, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll notice telltale signs of lunacy everywhere. Style insiders see patterns and trends in everything; they suffer from outsize personality disorders and delusions of grandeur; and of course, they have a predilection for theatrical makeup and artfully destroyed clothing. No one is more suited to the asylum than the truly die-hard fashionistaÃ¢â‚¬â€after all, eccentricity and extremism are the foundations of great style.With his gimlet eye for the absurd and a love for eccentricity, DoonanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal and professional stories never fail to entertain. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The David Sedaris of the style universeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (The Boston Globe) gives us the scoop on the kooky, cutthroatÃ¢â‚¬â€but always fabulousÃ¢â‚¬â€fashion world, and proves himself one of the sharpest humorists writing today","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b76be4802819e95e6bf6b23b4d1704b09ec8aec","amp;dn":"The+Asylum+-+Simon+Doonan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b76be4802819e95e6bf6b23b4d1704b09ec8aec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,118,190,72,2,129,158,149,230,191,107,35,180,209,112,75,9,236,138,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
