There is also some cutting involved, but only in one or two of the designs.\nThe benefit of modular origami, is that it is possible to get more detail into the models and these dinosaurs really do look great once they are finished. They are quite easy to adapt, so you can put them in different poses.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9637c013fc06f353e20e52690fb685785da4bd07","amp;dn":"Jurassic+Origami","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9637c013fc06f353e20e52690fb685785da4bd07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,55,192,19,252,6,243,83,226,14,82,105,15,182,133,120,93,164,189,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
