Native Instruments was successful in hiring the services of renowned, international artists from various electronic genres to produce this eclectic collection of kits. The result is a selection of 36 unique and contemporary drum kits with more than 2000 samples that instantly distinguish themselves from other drum sample libraries.\nInternational Artists\nAll of the drum kits included in SYTHETIC DRUMS 2 were produced by internationally-renowned producers. Native Instuments would like to thank the following artists for their incredible contribution to the SYNTHETIC DRUMS 2 sample collection:\n\nSpeedy J/Funkarma, Telefon Tel Aviv, Lusine, Chris Liebing, FunkstÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rung, Eden, Jake Mandell, Freeform, Plaid, Richard Devine, Simon Pyke, Smyglyssna, Kai Tracid, Atom Heart, SeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±or Coconut, Murcof, Bob Humid, Sutekh, Einoma, Junkie XL, Exile, Dan Curtin, MRI, Andrew Phillpott/Christian Eigner, Pendulum, Rob Acid, ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡me.\nElectrifying Beats\nSYNTHETIC DRUMS 2 offers a huge selection of inspiring sounds. From earth-shuddering bass samples and snares that cut straight through the mix to effects that instantly capture the imagination, this collection encompasses an extremely wide range of electronic styles. Whether House or Hiphop, IDM or UKG, Techno or Trance, R'n'B or D'n'B, Old School or Nu Skool ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ SYNTHETIC DRUMS 2 has its finger on the pulse.\nSample Twisting\nThe over 2400 samples have all been produced exclusively for Synthetic Drums 2. A huge arsenal of equipment was used to create the sounds. The samples themselves were subjected to a lengthy production process involving numerous effects, filters, ring modulators, compressors, frequency shifters, granular samplers and so on. All of the producers were given complete artistic freedom, resulting in an extremely varied and individual set of kits. Every kit also has a short demo sound-clip that has been produced exclusively with the samples from that kit. A MIDI file is also included, offering an insight into how the clip was arranged.\nBATTERY 2 and KONTAKT\nThe 36 drum kits have all been optimized for use with BATTERY 2 and KONTAKT, making heavy use of the varied sound processing features such as filters, loops, velocity, effects and modulation. The results are extremely diverse and distinctive sounds that can be quickly trimmed to individual needs in BATTERY 2 and KONTAKT. All the samples are included in 24-bit / 44.1 KHz WAV format. To give an overview of what is available, SYNTHETIC DRUMS 2 also contains special kits that group all the bass drums, all the snares, all the toms and so on into individual kits. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fe96957c53fd446bb12a83ca4067fa11df1f3bb","amp;dn":"Native+Instruments+NI+Synthetic+Drums+2+Kontakt+3+VST+VSTi+Sampl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fe96957c53fd446bb12a83ca4067fa11df1f3bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,233,105,87,197,63,212,70,187,18,168,60,164,6,127,161,29,241,243,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
