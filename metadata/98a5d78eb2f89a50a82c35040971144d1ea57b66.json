Nicholas Courtney returns to play Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart in 'Battlefield'. He first appeared with the Second Doctor in 1968 in 'The Web of Fear' before becoming a recurring character throughout the Second Doctor to the Fifth Doctor and last appearing in 'The Five Doctors'. Anthony Ainley returns to play The Master in 'Survival', having last appeared in 'The Ultimate Foe' (1986). This would be Ainley's final television appearance in the role, though he would return to portray the Master one final time in the computer game Destiny of the Doctors.\n\nContinuing on from Season 25, Season 26 continued script editor Andrew Cartmel's move to push the series towards a darker approach, focusing this time more on Ace's personal life as well as The Doctor's past and manipulations.\n\nTotal Episodes: 14\n\n01 - 'Battlefield' - 4 Episodes\n\n     Synopsis: The Doctor and Ace receive a mysterious distress signal and land in\n     the Earth village of Carbury, where a nuclear convoy has halted.

Nearby is Lake Voortigen, the mythical resting-place of Excalibur,\n     King Arthur's mystical sword. But the lake holds a more sinister secret. A\n     spaceship from the same alien dimension lurks under the lake - but does it\n     really contain Arthur's corpse? And what is it that the Witch Queen,\n     Morgaine, is really after? The Doctor's old friend the Brigadier is sent in\n     to investigate, but the Doctor's happiness is short-lived.

In order to combat\n     Josiah's evil presence, the Doctor arranges the release of a more powerful\n     entity called Light - the true owner of the alien ship.

Before long the mysterious\n     kidnappers make themselves known. A race of galactic hunters called the\n     Cheetah people have found a way to transport themselves to Earth - and the\n     entire human race is their prey.

As the Doctor tries to\n     unravel the mystery, Ace finds some of her old friends, trapped on the savage\n     and beautiful world of the Cheetah People.

The Doctor realizes that Ace's new powers will provide\n     the only route home, but it will mean the sacrifice of her humanity to the\n     most bestial and dark side of human nature.\n\n\nNOTE: It is with great satisfaction that I have completed my journey. Back on\n      October 13, 2013 I decided to compile the Classic Doctor Who episodes I\n      could find and make them available to you. Further, it was my plan to try\n      and keep the digital footprint as small as I could without totally\n      destroying the quality of the videos. Only time will tell if I was\n      successful. Enjoy and cheers to all you Whovians!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98a5d78eb2f89a50a82c35040971144d1ea57b66","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+Season+26+-+%281989%29+-+14+Episodes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98a5d78eb2f89a50a82c35040971144d1ea57b66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,165,215,142,178,248,154,80,168,44,53,4,9,113,20,77,30,165,123,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
