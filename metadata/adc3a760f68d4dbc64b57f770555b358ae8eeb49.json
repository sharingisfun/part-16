It's also notable that they were NOT a team at Quality, but were only packaged as such once they &quot;reached&quot; DC.\n\nIf you download this, check out issues 8 and 9 in which the Fighters go up against thinly-veiled copies of CAPTAIN AMERICA, THE HUMAN TORCH and SUB-MARINER!\n\nIn addition to Freedom Fighters volume 1, I included the two-part JUSTICE LEAGUE OF AMERICA story that introduced the group. And just for the hell of it, I also threw in the rarely-torrented two-part UNCLE SAM Vertigo book, fully-painted by ALEX ROSS!\n\nEnjoy! Please seed and share with our friends here on TPB!\n\n------\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nFreedom Fighters is a DC Comics comic book superhero team made up of characters acquired from the defunct company Quality Comics. Although the characters were created by Quality, they never were gathered in a group before acquired by DC. The team first appeared in a Justice League of America/Justice Society of America team-up, which ran in Justice League of America #107-108 (OctoberÃ¢â‚¬â€œDecember 1973), written by Len Wein and drawn by Dick Dillin. Their own ongoing series premiered with Freedom Fighters #1 (April 1976), written by Gerry Conway and Martin Pasko, and drawn by Ric Estrada.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adc3a760f68d4dbc64b57f770555b358ae8eeb49","amp;dn":"FREEDOM+FIGHTERS+volume+1+%281976-1978%29+plus+extras+%28DC%29+REQUESTED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adc3a760f68d4dbc64b57f770555b358ae8eeb49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,195,167,96,246,141,77,188,100,181,127,119,5,85,179,88,174,142,235,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
