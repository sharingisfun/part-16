Ace fiddlers Gid Tanner, Clayton McMichen, Bert Layne, and one-handed Lowe Stokes were all members, in various combinations. Anchored by Riley Puckett's steady bass runs on guitar, they blazed a path through the dance reels of the day, taking them to soaring heights. This six-disc set is the most complete collection of the Skillet Lickers currently out there, covering sessions recorded in Atlanta and San Antonio between 1926 and 1934. Fiddle standards like &quot;Hell's Broke Loose in Georgia,&quot; &quot;Cripple Creek,&quot; and &quot;Sugar in the Gourd&quot; are all tackled here at breakneck speed, which is pretty much how these guys did everything.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6723d46efa62b550fcfc00da5c9ecf0f1c41f78c","amp;dn":"Gid+Tanner+and+His+Skillet+Lickers+-+Complete+Works+1926-34+%286CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6723d46efa62b550fcfc00da5c9ecf0f1c41f78c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,35,212,110,250,98,181,80,252,252,0,218,92,158,207,15,28,65,247,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
