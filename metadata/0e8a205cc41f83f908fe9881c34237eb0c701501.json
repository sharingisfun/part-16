Her search for an answer reveals a plot to replace troublesome real wives with more accommodating fake ones. The closer she gets to the truth, the more danger she faces--not to mention the likelihood that the men in town intend to replace her as well. This film is so much better than the 2004 comic remake with Nicole Kiddman.\n\n  Starring: Katharine Ross, Paula Prentiss, Peter Masterson, Nanette Newman, Tina Louise.\n\n  Directed by: Bryan Forbes.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 55min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 448","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e8a205cc41f83f908fe9881c34237eb0c701501","amp;dn":"The+Stepford+Wives+%281975%29+%28Katharine+Ross%2C+Paula+Prentiss%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e8a205cc41f83f908fe9881c34237eb0c701501","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,138,32,92,196,31,131,249,8,254,152,129,195,66,55,235,12,112,21,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
