I was always complaining to my friends, &quot;Wow there is NO torrent with the Official Sound Track to Dark Cloud Two! WTF?! It&amp;#039;s such an awesome game!&quot; \n\nBUT HAH! I went through the torture, and will hopefully save everyone a butt load of time. \n\n------------------\n\nAnyways, it is a 2 disc set thing. I don&amp;#039;t really wanna type the whole play list, so here is the link! \n&lt;lazy&gt; http://bluelaguna.net/music/dc2ost/mp3s.php &lt;/lazy&gt;\n\nYep, scanned by AVG. Its clear. \n\nHave fun guys! This is such a sweet freaking game! I&amp;#039;m so surprised I&amp;#039;m the first to torrent this sound track &lt;3! (first I&amp;#039;ve seen at least &gt;.&gt;)\n\n-----143 MB------\n\nLike GDW, I WILL ALWAYS SEED! Unless my computer is unhooked, or I&amp;#039;m playing World of Warcraft. So, help seeding is always appreciated! ^-^!
