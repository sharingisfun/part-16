Armi focuses on buildings in northern Italy, Switzerland, southern France, and Catalonia, the regions where Romanesque architecture first appeared around 1000 AD. He integrates the study of medieval structure with an understanding of construction, decoration and articulation in an effort to determine the origins and originality of medieval architecture and the formation of the High Romanesque style. Relying on a close analysis of the fabric of key buildings, Armi's in depth study reveals new knowledge about design decisions in the early Middle Ages.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 234 pages\n    * Publisher: Cambridge University Press (January 12, 2004)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0521830338\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0521830331","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14c90ce77eb0edbe45817b149b4e45e95e0a8b84","amp;dn":"Design+and+Construction+in+Romanesque+Architecture%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14c90ce77eb0edbe45817b149b4e45e95e0a8b84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,201,12,231,126,176,237,190,69,129,123,20,155,78,69,233,94,10,139,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
