While teaching how to write programmable shaders, the authors also teach and reinforce the fundamentals of computer graphics. The second edition has been updated to incorporate changes in the OpenGL API (OpenGL 4.x and GLSL 4.x0) and also has a chapter on the new tessellation shaders, including many practical examples.\n\nThe book starts with a quick review of the graphics pipeline, emphasizing features that are rarely taught in introductory courses, but are immediately exposed in shader work. It then covers shader-specific theory for vertex, tessellation, geometry, and fragment shaders using the GLSL 4.x0 shading language. The text also introduces the freely available glman tool that enables you to develop, test, and tune shaders separately from the applications that will use them. The authors explore how shaders can be used to support a wide variety of applications and present examples of shaders in 3D geometry, scientific visualization, geometry morphing, algorithmic art, and more.\n\nFeatures of the Second Edition:\n\n \n\n    Written using the most recent specification releases (OpenGL 4.x and GLSL 4.x0) including code examples brought up-to-date with the current standard of the GLSL language.\n    More examples and more exercises\n    A chapter on tessellation shaders\n    An expanded Serious Fun chapter with examples that illustrate using shaders to produce fun effects\n    A discussion of how to handle the major changes occurring in the OpenGL standard, and some C++ classes to help you manage that transition\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e91aab7668011f199e9a50dedb8853ed8791abfe","amp;dn":"Graphics+Shaders+Theory+and+Practice%2C+2nd+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e91aab7668011f199e9a50dedb8853ed8791abfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,26,171,118,104,1,31,25,158,154,80,222,219,136,83,237,135,145,171,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
