Scarre notes that many of those networks still survive in one form or another.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0da0dd31e1a2ad64208e08544b90262d0052a1f","amp;dn":"The+Penguin+Historical+Atlas+of+Ancient+Rome","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0da0dd31e1a2ad64208e08544b90262d0052a1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,218,13,211,30,26,42,214,66,8,224,133,68,185,2,98,208,5,42,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
