HARDCOVER, 657 pages. By Jim Mauro &amp; Richard McDougall. From 2001. The definitive Sun MicroSystems guide to the internals of the Solaris kernel. This book focuses on the core kernel functions, major data structures and algorithms. Its practical approach makes it an essential resource for anyone responsiblefor kernel, driver or application software. Anyone doing development, debugging, maintenance, performing tuning, capacity planning, or application tuning will also benefit from this book. This authoritative and comprehensive guide covers the key components that comprise the Solaris kernel. The modular architecture of the kernel is discussed and each major subsystem is fully explored. Topics covered include: Scheduler implementation and behavior, the Solaris multi-threaded architecture, multi-threaded synchronization primitives, the Solaris Virtual Memory implementation, including tools for memory measurement and analysis, the Virtual File System Framework, techniques for analyzing kernel behavior and structures with sar, vmstat, crash, and adb.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04b2882197817d51685087bf04a68521a01a3351","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2000%5D+Solaris+Internals+Core+Kernel+Architecture","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04b2882197817d51685087bf04a68521a01a3351","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,178,136,33,151,129,125,81,104,80,135,191,4,166,133,33,160,26,51,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
