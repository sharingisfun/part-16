Most of the recordings are from 1942 by the Raymond Scott Orchestra, though there are a few different years, and one by the Raymond Scott Quintet (not the Quintette. That is another story).\n\nThere are two sets of the same recordings. The first is straight off the vinyl, the second is re-equalised to increase the dynamic range. These types of collections often had limited fidelity, less than the 78s even. However few of these songs are available today on anything other than the original 78s and collections like this one. None are on CD; the version of &quot;The Toy Trumpet&quot; on here is not the same as on Reckless Nights and Turkish Twilights. A different year, and the Orchestra instead of the Quintette.\n\nThere are pops and crackling on some, though most are fairly clean, and all are certainly listenable.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:145bea6e9e869d73631e8a81763310f248ea60fd","amp;dn":"Raymond+Scott-+Get+Happy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"145bea6e9e869d73631e8a81763310f248ea60fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,91,234,110,158,134,157,115,99,30,138,129,118,51,16,242,72,234,96,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
