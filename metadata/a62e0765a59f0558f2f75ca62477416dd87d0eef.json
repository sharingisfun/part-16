Reilly, Julianne Moore, \nBurt Reynolds, Heather Graham, William H. Macy, \nLuis GuzmÃƒÂ¡n, Nicole Ari Parker, Don Cheadle and Philip Baker Hall\n\n\n-----------------\nEddie Adams, a young man working in a nightclub, is discovered by porn director Jack Horner, who soon puts Eddie and his &quot;talent&quot; on the top of the pornography industry. But when the 1980s arrive, Dirk and his colleagues in the porn industry have to cope with a new era as well as the baggage carried with them from the 1970s.\n \n\nP.T. Anderson is the greatest director of the last 20 years and this film, his second major release, introduced him to the world. With a mind blowing cast and the vision of a true craftsman Anderson\nrecreates not only a time and place, but a mentality.  Ushering in a string of masterpieces this film still to many defines what a P. T. Anderson film is.  Boogie Nights may not be his best film, but \nless ambitious than Magnolia and quicker paced than There Will Be Blood and The Master, it certainly is his most accessible, and for now, popular film.\n-----------------\n\n\nRegion 1 (NTSC) DVD9\nRipped with no compression using DVDShrink 3.2\nFrench audio removed, dubbing is a sin\n\nSubs: English, French, Spanish\n\nMotion Picture Rating (MPAA): Rated R\nRuntime: 155 min\nSound Mix: Dolby Digital | SDDS\nAspect Ratio:  2.35:1\nRelease Date: 10 October 1997 (USA)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a62e0765a59f0558f2f75ca62477416dd87d0eef","amp;dn":"Boogie+Nights+%281997%29+Paul+Thomas+Anderson+%5BNTSC-DVD9%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a62e0765a59f0558f2f75ca62477416dd87d0eef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,46,7,101,165,159,5,88,242,247,92,166,36,119,65,109,216,125,14,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
