It was originally released in 1989 on Delicious Vinyl and was later re-issued by Rhino Records.\n\nThe album itself did well commercially, reaching #9 on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nMarvin Young (born May 10, 1967), better known by his stage name Young M.C., is an English-born American singer, rapper and actor. He is best known for his 1989 hit &quot;Bust a Move&quot;. His debut album Stone Cold Rhymin' found international acclaim; however, subsequent albums have not reached the same level of success. Young has also appeared in film in acting roles and cameo appearances and has appeared in several television programs.\n\nBorn in London to Jamaican immigrants then left England at the age of three and moved to Queens, New York when he was eight years old. Young attended Hunter College High School in the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He went on to earn a degree in economics from the University of Southern California (USC). At USC he met Michael Ross and Matt Dike from the record company Delicious Vinyl. Young rapped over the phone for Ross and Dike, who ended up delivering a record contract to his USC dorm room. In 1989, Young collaborated with Tone LÃ…ï¿½c on the songs &quot;Wild Thing&quot; and &quot;Funky Cold Medina&quot;. Young gained fame with the release of his single &quot;Bust a Move&quot;, which reached No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 and won a Grammy for Best Rap Performance. The single helped Young's debut album, Stone Cold Rhymin', to reach No. 9 on the Billboard 200 and attain platinum status in the US. The follow-up single, &quot;Principal's Office&quot;, reached No. 33 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was nominated for Best Rap Video at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nIn 2009, Young released his eighth album, Relentless. Later that year, Young also landed a cameo role in the Jason Reitman film Up in the Air starring George Clooney. Young played himself, performing at a software convention which was crashed by ClooneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s character and those of his two female co-stars, Anna Kendrick and Vera Farmiga.\n\n\n\n\nYoung M.C. - Stone Cold Rhymin' (1989) [FLAC] folder contains:\n\nCD\n(01) [Young M.C.] I Come Off.flac\n(02) [Young M.C.] Principal's Office.flac\n(03) [Young M.C.] Bust A Move.flac\n(04) [Young M.C.] Non Stop.flac\n(05) [Young M.C.] Fastest Rhyme.flac\n(06) [Young M.C.] My Name Is Young.flac \n(07) [Young M.C.] Know How.flac\n(08) [Young M.C.] Roll With The Punches.flac\n(09) [Young M.C.] I Let 'Em Know.flac\n(10) [Young M.C.] Pick Up The Pace.flac\n(11) [Young M.C.] Got More Rhymes.flac\n(12) [Young M.C.] Stone Cold Buggin'.flac\n(13) [Young M.C.] Just Say No.flac\n\n\nFile properties info for the CD (FLAC) files using Media Player Classic: \n   Audio: FLAC (framed) 44100Hz stereo 1411kbps\n   Duration: 00:00:00 (varied)\n   Exact Audio Copy V1.0 beta 2\n   Medieval CUE Splitter\n\n\nalso 4 photos + info, log, cue and m3u text files\n\n\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Cold_Rhymin'&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Cold_Rhymin'&lt;/a&gt; \n    \n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
