This has been made possible by assembling excellent contributions from active researchers, groups, or institutions, thus providing full coverage of the many scientific and engineering aspects of this type of marine and coastal geo-hazard. It covers fundamental as well as site specific studies from many areas including the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, inner seas such as the Mediterranean Sea, and fjords using the most recent technologies from multibeam sonar imaging techniques, 3D seismic analysis, slope stability analysis, to debris flow and tsunami modeling. Audience This book is of interest to any researcher in the field of marine and coastal geo-hazards. It will be useful for planners, scientists and engineers involved in the development of offshore and near-shore resources and also to those in charge of the management and mitigation of coastal hazards. For graduate students, this book provides an up-to-date vision of the process of submarine mass movements and their consequences from both a scientific and an engineering standpoint, and it includes a unique collection of the existing literature on marine geo-hazards. DVD-ROM included This volume contains a DVD-ROM with full color images which are printed in black-and-white in the book.  \nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 424 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1 edition (November 14, 2007)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1402065116\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1402065118","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8183bfd4b11c899a52227014ace88076eda30180","amp;dn":"Submarine+Mass+Movements+and+Their+Consequences+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8183bfd4b11c899a52227014ace88076eda30180","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,131,191,212,177,28,137,154,82,34,112,20,172,232,128,118,237,163,1,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
