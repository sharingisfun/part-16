An artist who in any other country would have been a one-hit wonder, in Jamaica became a household name having invented a whole new vocal style, sing-jay, flooding the airwaves with his catch phrases and going on to become a respected toaster. Eek-A-Mouse didn't start out as a novelty act. He was born Ripton Hilton in 1957 in Kingston, Jamaica, and his first foray into the music world was as a cultural roots singer.\n\n\n\nFormat: Mp3\nBitrate: 320 CBR\nContains: Album Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n01.Physically Critically\n02.Press A Button\n03.I Love Weed\n04.Every Posse (Fly Down)\n05.Keep Accusing Me\n06.IÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´ll Be Waiting\n07.Champagne Bottle\n08.Joey Joey\n09.Wa-Do-Dem (Revisited)\n10.Mean Dreams\n11.Tek Wey\n12.Politics\n13.Pretty So\n14.Let There Be Night\n15.Nuh Lie Down\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n                   ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fe6c1492c40c087732e887fb774eba8515e9f1f","amp;dn":"Eek-A-Mouse+-+Eek-A-Speeka+%282004%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fe6c1492c40c087732e887fb774eba8515e9f1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,230,193,73,44,64,192,135,115,46,136,127,183,116,235,168,81,94,159,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
