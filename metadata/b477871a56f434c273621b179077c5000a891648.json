In the midst of everything a gigantic black wall separates the solar system in two, absorbing all light and matter! The universe's last hope is a band of soldiers facing court martial. They are the men and women of the Purgatory Squadron! Their mission: investigate the mysterious black wall, save the universe, and try not to die in the process!\n\n\nUniversal War One - Revelations:\n\nThe Purgatory SquadronÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s survivors have done the impossible: By traveling through time, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve shut down the impenetrable Wall that cut the solar system in two. In doing so, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve discovered that the rebellious Colonization Industrial Companies have hidden a satellite in Earth's orbit that could destroy the planet just as the CIC eradicated Uranus. But the Purgatory Squadron has a trump card. \n\nNow stranded three days in their own past, they just might be able to return to Earth without notice. That gives the team of outcasts and criminals three days to stop a cataclysm that could bring about the first universal war. \n\n\n** If you have any questions please feel free to ask! **","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b477871a56f434c273621b179077c5000a891648","amp;dn":"Universal+War+One+%5BComplete%5D+%2B+Revelations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b477871a56f434c273621b179077c5000a891648","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,119,135,26,86,244,52,194,115,98,27,23,144,119,197,0,10,137,22,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
