For decades Lewin's GENES has provided the teaching community with the most cutting edge presentation of molecular biology and molecular genetics, covering gene structure, sequencing, organization, and expression. The latest edition, with a knowledgeable new author team, has enlisted 21 scientists to provide revisions and content updates in their individual fields of expertise, ensuring that Lewin's GENES X is the most current and comprehensive text in the field. Informative new chapters, as well as a reorganization of material, provide a more logical flow of topics and many chapters have been renamed to better indicate their contents. Lewin's GENES X also contains new pedagogical features to help students learn as they read and an online student study guide allows students to test themselves on key material.\n\n \n\nWe are on FaceBook, Post Your Request, suggestion, and find upcomming Release of Silver RG, you will find all Silver RG Encoders at FB Page so keep in touch\n\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, AllEncoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d84925b06423d658a6f797f203c932b0eac88f42","amp;dn":"Lewin%27s+Genes+X+PDF+sum1_here+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d84925b06423d658a6f797f203c932b0eac88f42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,73,37,176,100,35,214,88,166,247,151,242,3,201,50,176,234,200,143,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
