Hayes became more of a singles artist than an album artist as he had been with Stax. Because of this, it&amp;#039;s perhaps best to seek out a best-of such as Best of Isaac Hayes: The Polydor Years rather than bother with his individual albums. This album collects 12 of his best moments from the era such as the somewhat notorious &quot;Moonlight Lovin&amp;#039; (MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nage ÃƒÆ’  Trois)&quot; and other disco-flavored songs like &quot;Zeke the Freak&quot; that may have not stormed up the charts but did fill the dancefloor on occasion. This collection provides the insight for fans about a difficult period in Hayes&amp;#039; career where he struggled to age gracefully and adjust to the jarring force of disco. It shows that contrary to popular belief, Hayes did find success during this era, even if it was only sporadic. (AMG)\n\n\n\n\n01.
