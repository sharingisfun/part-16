The Gordon series also regularly treks through the landscape of lesbian and womenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s culture. Early books were set in a girlsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ school and a womenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s peace camp; later books explore the changing terrain of lesbian relationships, from breakups to affairs to lesbian parenting.\n \nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4ad01e17a0f4be841482786bcb7eca0223810a8","amp;dn":"Val+McDermid+-+Lindsay+Gordon+lesbian+Mystery+Series%2Cepub%2CKK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4ad01e17a0f4be841482786bcb7eca0223810a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,173,1,225,122,15,75,232,65,72,39,134,188,183,236,160,34,56,16,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
