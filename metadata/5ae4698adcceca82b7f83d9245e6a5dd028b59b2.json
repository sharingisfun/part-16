Grable, &quot;Financial Planning and Counseling Scales&quot;\nPublisher: Springer | ISBN: 1441969071 | edition 2010 | PDF | 647 pages | 3.6 mb\n\nThe personal, household, and consumer finance field is growing quite rapidly, especially as universities and policy makers see the need for additional research and clinical application in this dynamic area of study. Currently, the profession is advancing towards the stage where professional practice becomes increasingly evidenced-based. Financial Planning and Counseling Scales provides educators, researchers, students, and practitioners with a much needed review of reliable and valid personal assessment scales and instruments that can be used for both research and clinical practice. In addition to presenting actual scales and instruments with applicable psychometric details, the book also includes an overview of measurement issues and psychometric evaluation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ae4698adcceca82b7f83d9245e6a5dd028b59b2","amp;dn":"Financial+Planning+and+Counseling+Scales","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ae4698adcceca82b7f83d9245e6a5dd028b59b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,228,105,138,220,206,202,130,183,248,61,146,69,230,165,221,2,139,89,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
