In 1937, a German national living in Queens stole the blueprints for the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most precious secret, the Norden Bombsight, delivering them to the German military two years before World War II started in Europe and four years before the US joined the fight. When the FBI uncovered a ring of Nazi spies in the city, President Franklin Roosevelt formally declared J.

This German-American, William G. Sebold, approached the FBI and became the first double agent in the BureauÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history, the center of a sixteen-month investigation that led to the arrest of a colorful cast of thirty-three enemy agents, among them a South African adventurer with an exotic accent and a monocle and a Jewish femme fatale, Lilly Stein, who escaped Nazi Vienna by offering to seduce US military men into whispering secrets into her ear","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db33ab13d400318db21c4621268390e74c313a45","amp;dn":"Double+Agent%3A+The+First+Hero+of+World+War+II","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db33ab13d400318db21c4621268390e74c313a45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,51,171,19,212,0,49,141,178,28,70,33,38,131,144,231,76,49,58,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
