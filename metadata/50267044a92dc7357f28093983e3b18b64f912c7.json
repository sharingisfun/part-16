This course is designed for residents of both: construction personnel, architects, and engineers who are looking to integrate design with the as-built world. Learn how to use Navisworks Manage and Navisworks Simulate to gain control and get a holistic view of your projects. Eric Wing shows how to manage models, clash the models for interference, and virtually construct a building using a construction timeline. He also shows how to create material takeoffs and conduct live, interactive walk-throughs with clients and contractors. On the surface, Navisworks might look like just a file viewer, but with this course, you'll learn things about its analysis and simulation tools that would be either impossible or impossibly expensive any other way.\r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tAppending and merging different file types\r\n\tâ€¢\tWalking through your model\r\n\tâ€¢\tWorking with viewpoints\r\n\tâ€¢\tReviewing and marking up a model\r\n\tâ€¢\tManipulating and finding objects\r\n\tâ€¢\tAdding links to objects\r\n\tâ€¢\tSorting and grouping\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating clash tests\r\n\tâ€¢\tAdding a timeline with the Timeliner\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating material takeoffs\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating custom animations and scripts for an interactive movie\r\n\r\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50267044a92dc7357f28093983e3b18b64f912c7","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Navisworks+Essential+Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50267044a92dc7357f28093983e3b18b64f912c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,38,112,68,169,45,199,53,127,40,9,57,131,227,177,139,100,249,18,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
