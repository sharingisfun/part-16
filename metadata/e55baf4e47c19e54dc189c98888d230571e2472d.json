Mixed in with the familiar selections was a brand-new track, the playful &quot;Tonight She Comes&quot; (which became a Top Ten hit), as well as a remix of the overlooked &quot;Shake It Up&quot; ballad &quot;I'm Not the One.&quot; And while most of the expected hits are represented (&quot;Just What I Needed,&quot; &quot;Let's Go,&quot; &quot;Drive,&quot; &quot;Shake It Up,&quot; etc.), some of the selections prove questionable -- why was the title track from Heartbeat City (an unsuccessful single) included instead of the 1984 Top 20 hit &quot;Hello Again&quot;? Other missing radio staples include &quot;You're All I've Got Tonight,&quot; &quot;It's All I Can Do,&quot; and the title track from Candy-O, which would have made the collection definitive (all are included on the more extensive Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology from 1995). But for the casual fan, Greatest Hits will do the trick.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e55baf4e47c19e54dc189c98888d230571e2472d","amp;dn":"The+Cars+-+Greatest+Hits+%281985%29+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e55baf4e47c19e54dc189c98888d230571e2472d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,91,175,78,71,193,158,84,220,24,156,152,136,141,35,5,113,226,71,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
