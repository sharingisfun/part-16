As they sweep across the world, they drive all life on earth, bringing huge opportunities and great challenges to everything. This special, narrated by Andrew Scott, celebrates the drama of Autumn and how animals and plants deal with the new challenges it brings.\r\nThis is the time of year that brings the world's most spectacular transformations. With winter fast approaching, life has to get ready and that means feeding up while you can, fighting for the last chance to breed and rushing to grow up before the cold returns. While chipmunks and beavers dash to stash their winter supplies, many animals from musk oxen to beetles have to battle for mates and young gannets must face life's first dangerous challenges.\r\n\r\nBBC (2016) - 60mins\r\n \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07xjt9p\r\n_______________________________________\r\n\r\n1280x720 resolution - MP4 files\r\n\r\nVideo Codec h.264\r\nAudio Codec AAC\r\n\r\nWith subtitles - Enjoy !!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14eba51b2403887aa0275b4fbbfa1f1039844d6f","amp;dn":"Autumn-Earths.Seasonal.Secrets--BBC-2016-w.subs-720p-MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14eba51b2403887aa0275b4fbbfa1f1039844d6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,235,165,27,36,3,136,122,160,39,91,79,187,250,31,16,57,132,77,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
