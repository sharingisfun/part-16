Growing up in suburban New Jersey, he was the typical American honor student: straight-As, on the lacrosse team, president of the Model U.N. He dreamed of following in his grandfatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s footsteps and graduating from the Ivy League. When he arrived at Dartmouth, however, he found not the prestigious college of years past, but a wasteland of privilege and moral entropy. And when he rushed Sigma Alpha Epsilon, the fraternity that inspired the rival house in Animal House, LohseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s once-perfect life, as well as his goals, began to crumble around him.\n\nLured by free booze and friendly brothers, Andrew pledged Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and soon his life became a dangerous cycle of binge drinking and public humiliation. From chugging vinegar to swimming in a pool of human waste, LohseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pledge class endured cruelty and psychological coercion in the hopes of obtaining a bid. Although Andrew succeeded in joining the fraternity, the pattern of abuse continuedÃ¢â‚¬â€except over time, he became the abuser.\n\nTold by a contemporary Holden Caulfield, this is a shocking exposÃƒÂ© of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most exclusive institutions and a cautionary tale for modern times.\n\n\nAbout the Author:\nAndrew Lohse grew up in Branchburg, NJ. He attended Dartmouth College, where he majored in English. At Dartmouth he was the Rush Chairman of notorious fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon, the Deputy Editor of The Dartmouth Independent, a columnist for The Dartmouth, and  a contributor for both The Dartmouth Review and the Dartmouth Free Press; he also published columns in the New York Daily News and The Harvard Crimson, and was a 2011 poetry fellow at the Vermont Studio Center. Some of his articlesÃ¢â‚¬â€including a profile of 2008 Libertarian presidential candidate Bob Barr, a series of op-eds on Dartmouth's Wall Street recruiting culture, and an expose of his fraternity's hazing practicesÃ¢â‚¬â€connected with a wide internet readership and were considered controversial. He was profiled by Rolling Stone in 2012. Also a freelance musician, Lohse lives in Vermont.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b9d7a4086b49431983efd6a6e6c7e3b0da0ad6c","amp;dn":"Confessions+of+an+Ivy+League+Frat+Boy%3A+A+Memoir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b9d7a4086b49431983efd6a6e6c7e3b0da0ad6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,157,122,64,134,180,148,49,152,62,253,106,110,108,126,59,13,160,173,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
