For their journey, the only &quot;tools&quot; they have are items a backpacker might carry: a 35 mm camera, condoms and a pack of cigarettes. They bushwhack their way through dense terrain, but the survival experts find themselves at odds over the best way to hydrate themselves. Dave drinks from a creek he believes to be safe from parasites, while Cody relies on hydration from the stalks of wild banana palm. The two eventually come to a wide river they believe is the way to help. But to travel the river, they must first join forces to lash together a homemade raft with bamboo and Lao vines.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2662c7d5232fc34230068c600acb3ca4e5352f2f","amp;dn":"Dual+Survival+S01E05+-+TyTy555","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2662c7d5232fc34230068c600acb3ca4e5352f2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,98,199,213,35,47,195,66,48,6,140,96,10,203,60,164,229,53,47,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
