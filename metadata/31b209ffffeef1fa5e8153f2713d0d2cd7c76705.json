Viewed by many as one of the most influential figures in Premier League history, and scorer of the goal that Arsenal fans voted the best in the club's history, Dennis Bergkamp is a true giant of the game. As a youngster, Bergkamp learned from the Dutch master Johan Cruyff. By the time the pupil was ready to graduate from Ajax and move abroad, he was ready to spread the word, but in Italy he found few willing listeners. It was only when he moved to Arsenal and linked up with Arsene Wenger that he met someone else who shared his vision for football's possibilities. Bergkamp became central to everything the club did: now he had become the teacher, their creative genius, and the one who inspired some of the wayward old guard to new heights, helping them to seven major trophies. Few footballers' books make you think anew, but in Stillness and Speed Bergkamp presents a new vision for the game and how it might be played. He was a player like no other; his story is told like no other. It is a book that will inspire football fans everywhere, whatever their allegiance.\n\nAuthor:\nBorn in Amsterdam in 1969, Dennis Bergkamp began his hugely successful career at Ajax, before moving to Inter Milan and then on to Arsenal in 1995, where he was a central figure in the side that won three league titles and four FA Cups. He also won 79 caps for the Netherlands. He is currently assistant manager at Ajax. \n\nAll thanks goes to the original uploaders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31b209ffffeef1fa5e8153f2713d0d2cd7c76705","amp;dn":"Stillness+and+Speed+%3AMy+Story+%5B2013%5D%5BDennis+Bergkamp%5Depubmobi%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31b209ffffeef1fa5e8153f2713d0d2cd7c76705","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,178,9,255,255,238,241,250,94,129,83,242,113,61,13,44,215,199,103,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
