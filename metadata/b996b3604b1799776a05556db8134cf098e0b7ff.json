Each case presents an unknown clinical disorder and examines differential diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes as well as relevant physiologic principles for a well-rounded review. Approximately 150 illustrations (most in full color) reinforce learning of the written material, while a practice test of USMLE-style questions-with explanations-aids in USMLE Steps 1 and 2 preparation.\n\n* Features a problem-based approach to promote interactive learning and to build a foundation of knowledge for the USMLE Steps 1 and 2 as well as for clinical practice.\n* Presents a summary of physiologic principles related to each unknown clinical disorder, along with differential diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes for a well-rounded review.\n* Includes nearly 150 illustrations, most in full color, that reinforce learning of the written material.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b996b3604b1799776a05556db8134cf098e0b7ff","amp;dn":"Problem-Based+Physiology-+Carroll+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b996b3604b1799776a05556db8134cf098e0b7ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,150,179,96,75,23,153,119,106,5,85,109,184,19,76,240,152,224,183,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
