While many contemporary texts on networks have presented critiques or analyses of network formations in our world, this book is the first to develop an entirely new worldview based on the structure of networks themselves. From global capitalism to artificial minds, evolutionary biology to quantum physics, networks are our future. Networkologies presents us with a new image of thought for our hyperconnected age.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nePub: 198 pages\nPublisher: Zero Books (September 26, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1780992386\nISBN-13: 978-1780992389\nAmazon Link:\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c50e472413d7381277ad690517257c40cfe8340","amp;dn":"Networkologies%3A+A+Philosophy+of+Networks+for+a+Hyperconnected+Ag","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c50e472413d7381277ad690517257c40cfe8340","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,80,228,114,65,61,115,129,39,122,214,144,81,114,87,196,12,254,131,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
