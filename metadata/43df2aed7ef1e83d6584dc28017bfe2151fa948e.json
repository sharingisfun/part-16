With nothing but his clothing, a tattered windbreaker, and the hatchet his mother had given him as a present, Brian finds himself completely alone.\n\nChallenged by his fear and despair, and plagued with the weight of a dreadful secret he's been keeping since his parent's divorce, brian must tame his inner demons in order to survive. It will take all his know-how and determination, and more courage than he knew he possessed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43df2aed7ef1e83d6584dc28017bfe2151fa948e","amp;dn":"Hatchet+-+Gary+Paulsen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43df2aed7ef1e83d6584dc28017bfe2151fa948e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,223,42,237,126,241,232,61,101,132,220,40,1,123,254,33,81,250,148,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
