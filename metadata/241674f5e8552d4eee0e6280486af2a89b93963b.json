The highpoint is a ten-minute version of &quot;Skylark&quot; that has a long unaccompanied section by the great tenor. Other memorable selections include &quot;The Everywhere Calypso&quot; and &quot;Playing in the Yard.&quot; Rollins plays soprano on &quot;Poinciana&quot; and is heard using electronics (George Cables' electric piano) for the first time but this music is not all that different from what he was playing prior to his retirement. (Allmusic)\nI can't say that is may favorit SR album, anyway, a highly enjoyable listening.\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Playin' In The Yard\n02 - Poinciana\n03 - The Everywhere Calypso\n04 - Keep Hold Of Yourself\n05 - Skylark\n\nPersonnel:\nSonny Rollins Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tenor saxophone, soprano saxophone (track 2)\nGeorge Cables Ã¢â‚¬â€œ electric piano (tracks 1 &amp; 2), piano (tracks 3 &amp; 5)\nBob Cranshaw Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass, electric bass (track 1)\nDavid Lee Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\nJack DeJohnette Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (tracks 1 &amp; 4)\nArthur Jenkins - congas, percussion (tracks 1 &amp; 3)\n\nEnjoy and share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:241674f5e8552d4eee0e6280486af2a89b93963b","amp;dn":"Sonny+Rollins+-+1972+-+Next+Album+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"241674f5e8552d4eee0e6280486af2a89b93963b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,22,116,245,232,85,45,78,238,14,98,128,72,106,242,168,155,147,150,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
