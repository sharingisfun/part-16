This should help to resolve minors getting overrun with rebels due to the recent global FL and maintenance changes. Some government types that already give substantial bonuses to FL and maintenance are exempted from these modifiers.\nA few region corrections.\nRemoved 'Kutna Hora' production modifier from Praha (produces silver) due to it giving that province ridiculous income.\nToned down FL and maintenance bonuses for Religious Orders.\nReorganised the idea group choices of England and Great Britain.\nIf a nation stops existing or being a subject, vassal integration variable is reset to 0.\nAdded a decision for Christian nations to rename reconquered Andalucian provinces.\n(Dei Gratia) The Swiss guard events now require Switzerland to exist.\n(Dei Gratia) The 'Call for Crusade' event should now never select the Rebels as the crusade target (!)\n(Dei Gratia) The 'Mission founded' event will now actually create a temple even if the province is a colony at the time.\n(Dei Gratia) Attempted to fix the bug in which having religious rebels break a country led to events suggesting the rebels were crushed.\n(Dei Gratia) Added a 'Flower War' CB for Toltecayotl countries.\n(Dei Gratia) Changed the way that conversion affects stability to make it much clearer to the player. Depending on the factors, it may actually increase stability to change religion!\n----Countries suffer -1 to -3 stability depending on how much of their country has already converted\n----Countries suffer an additional -0 to -3 stability depending on how much church influence they have\n----Countries can gain +0 to +3 stability for monarch stats and converting their capital\n----Countries can gain +1 stability for having a theologian\n----Countries can gain up to +2 stability for being recently converted or re-converting\n----Total: -6 to +4 stability for conversion depending on circumstances\n(Dei Gratia) All Catholic countries now have the option to choose liberal or conservative reforms of the church during the Reformation; this will affect the AI's chance of choosing each option, as well as adding effects to choosing them. Both chances and effects are stronger if the pope has acknowledged conciliarism.\n(Dei Gratia) Hussite raids can no longer destroy temples (but Taborite rebels can if they win a siege).\n(Dei Gratia) Countries should no longer get religious prestige when founding a colony, only when turning it into a city.\n(Dei Gratia) Several decisions now require countries to save up monarch points before enacting them (vs going into debt), including the Edict of Tolerance, Request Autonomy, some missionary decisions, and the Claim Sharif decision.\n(Dei Gratia) Ordinary religious rebels will no longer defect.\n(Dei Gratia) Many province fixes to Catholic archbishoprics and prelates.\n(Dei Gratia) Adds several late start archbishoprics to the game.\n(Dei Gratia) It is now possible for provinces to gain the archbishopric modifier by event if they are your capital or have an effective bishop present.\n(Dei Gratia) Limits Muslim minorities in China slightly to avoid ahistorical results.\n(Dei Gratia) Adds the Royal Patronage of the Indies decision to the game. Untested effects on the Reformation - if it works as planned, should reduce Portugal and Spain's tendency to convert without affecting much else.\nLowered the EXTRA_LAND_REINFORCE_COST in defines.lua to a more reasonable value.\n&quot;Lancaster&quot; and &quot;York&quot; now count as &quot;Plantagenet&quot; in the HYW events.\nCulture conversion event now takes in account the Pontic and Cappadocian Greek cultures.\nCompared power (military size, number of cities or prestige) of Castile and Aragon now determines who is senior partner in the Union.\nIf a crusader kingdom owns a province of its culture, it loses the crusader_kingdom flag.\nDoubled the capital_city bonuses to MP and tax.\n(Dei Gratia) Fixes a localisation for one Papal Controller event that would give players the wrong impression.\n(Dei Gratia) More support for the Patronato Real: new colonial nations should now get the same effects as existing ones.\n(Dei Gratia) Changed some of the bonus from the Patronato Real triggered modifiers.\n(Dei Gratia) Added a new event for colonies in which natives could pretend to convert, but later revert back to their old ways.\n(Dei Gratia) The 'natives convert' event now works differently.\n(Dei Gratia) The Papal States gets a 100 ADM 'refund' if it is forced to move its capital away from Rome after manually doing so.\n(Dei Gratia) Adds a notifier event if Jerusalem is taken by Jews.\n(Dei Gratia) Adds the option for a Jewish country to move its capital to Jerusalem if it conquers it.\n(Dei Gratia) Adds Jewish cultures to the game. They can appear if a Jewish country conquers Jerusalem.\n(Dei Gratia) Removed the 'Parliament of VÃƒÂ¤sterÃƒÂ¥s' flavor event as it makes no sense with Dei Gratia (and can lead to Sweden becoming Protestant before the Reformation!)\n(Dei Gratia) Fixes a bug in which the Lollards and Hussites would never arise if England stayed Anglois.\n(Dei Gratia) Adds a few Catholic archbishoprics to Eastern Europe and the Americas.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:559a477f1d5d409a94c5036c159ab470cbbe0db3","amp;dn":"MEIOU+and+Taxes+%288%2F3%2F14%29+-+Europa+Universalis+IV+mod","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"559a477f1d5d409a94c5036c159ab470cbbe0db3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,154,71,127,29,93,64,154,148,197,3,108,21,154,180,112,203,190,13,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
