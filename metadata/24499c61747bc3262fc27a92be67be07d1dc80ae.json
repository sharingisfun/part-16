Except this would extend to chocolate, and cakes, and ice-cream, and cookies. Just anything sweet, and sinful. \r\nSinfully Yours is a collection of Shipraâ€™s favourite desserts. It includes classics that her mother and grandmother taught her; sweets that she came up when experimenting in college; desserts that she thought of to keep both her kids happy; the mousse with which she got the first apron in MasterChef, and the mascarpone that she won the competition with. An exhaustive collection of the most delicious, delectable sweets dishes, this book is a must-have for any dessert lover â€” and which of us is not one!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24499c61747bc3262fc27a92be67be07d1dc80ae","amp;dn":"Sinfully+Yours+by+Shipra+Khanna","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24499c61747bc3262fc27a92be67be07d1dc80ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,73,156,97,116,123,195,38,47,194,122,146,190,103,190,7,209,220,128,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
