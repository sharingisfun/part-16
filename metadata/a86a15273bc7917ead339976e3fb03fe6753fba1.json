Despite the date, these short dances are of a definite pre-Baroque flavour. Wonderful late-night music :)\n\nThe files in this torrent are FLAC.  However they are from a CD made using 192K VBR MP3 files that I have encoded in FLAC to avoid further quality loss from recompression, as I was unable to locate my original.  \n\nThese tracks sparkle in spite of the MP3 source.  However I strongly urge you all (as indeed I do with all my torrents of CDs that are still commercially available) to purchase it in the original if you like what you hear.\n\n192K VBR MP3 in FLAC format\n__\n\n\nPaisible : Six Setts of Aires (Naxos)\nMusica Barocca \n\n \n1.\tSett in D minor: I.
