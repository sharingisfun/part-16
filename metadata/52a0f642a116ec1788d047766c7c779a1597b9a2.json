These are consistent, rhythmic stimuli that entrains and stimulates brainwaves. Isochronic tones are the most effective form of rhythmic stimulus. In essence, an Isochronic tone is an evenly spaced tone-based pulse  which simply turns on and off at a specified rate per second. Because the tones turn off so quickly, they produce extremely strong responses in the brain, which leads to most effective possible brainwave stimulation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52a0f642a116ec1788d047766c7c779a1597b9a2","amp;dn":"Brain+Synch+for+Sleep+Induction+MP3+USE+W%2F+HEADPHONES","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52a0f642a116ec1788d047766c7c779a1597b9a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,160,246,66,161,22,236,23,136,208,71,118,108,124,119,154,21,151,185,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
