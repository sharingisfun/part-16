The Offspring crossed over due to the raucous, Eastern-tinged single &quot;Come Out and Play,&quot; which stopped and started just like Nirvana, only without the Seattle trio's recklessness. The record stayed in the charts because The Offspring sounded relentlessly heavy, no matter how much the band claimed to be punk. Their tempos are slower than traditional hardcore, and their attack is as heavy as Metallica. But they acted like they were punk, with odes to no &quot;Self Esteem&quot; and singing about fighting in school. Nothing on the album matches the incessant catchiness of the singles, but Smash is a solid record, filled with enough heavy riffs to keep most teenagers happy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e08c8cbe5df2c8d3d0b28d8bfb686037e5df01f3","amp;dn":"The+Offspring+-+Smash+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e08c8cbe5df2c8d3d0b28d8bfb686037e5df01f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,140,140,190,93,242,200,211,208,178,141,139,251,104,96,55,229,223,1,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
