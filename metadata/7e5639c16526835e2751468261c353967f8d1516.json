Nasar Meer's lucid analysis of the complex processes at work is a timely reminder of the dangers of an over-simplified understanding of both Islam and Muslim communities. This is a book that deserves the widest possible readership' - John Solomos, Professor of Sociology, City University London, UK 'Nasar Meer's timely book makes an important contribution to current understandings of multiculturalism in Britain. He successfully deploys a critical application of the work of W.E.B Du Bois to theorise 'Muslim-consciousness' in relation to state funding of Muslim schools, race discrimination legislation and media representations of Muslim identity. The book uses Du Bois' notion of consciousness to articulate a nuanced understanding of British Muslim consciousness, distinguishing between a consciousness that exists 'in itself' and 'for itself', where the former is a socially imposed consciousness and the latter which is a product of self-mobilisation. Meer's work is both theoretically strong and empirically original.' - Judith Squires, Professor of Political Theory, University of Bristol, UK","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e5639c16526835e2751468261c353967f8d1516","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2010%5D+Citizenship%2C+identity+and+the+politics+of+multicult","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e5639c16526835e2751468261c353967f8d1516","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,86,57,193,101,38,131,94,39,81,70,130,97,195,83,150,127,141,21,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
