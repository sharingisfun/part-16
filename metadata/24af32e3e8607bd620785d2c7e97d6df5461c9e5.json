Her yearly appearances at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland were highlights of the festival weekend, and were often released as live albums. Her 1975 set--backed by pianist Tommy Flanagan and his rhythm section--is a spirited whirl through jazz and pop history. Opening with the Ellington classics &quot;Caravan&quot; and &quot;Satin Doll,&quot; Fitzgerald and Flanagan essay Cole Porter&amp;#039;s &quot;Let&amp;#039;s Do It,&quot; two samba jewels by Antonio Carlos Jobim and the Billie Holiday classic &quot;Tain&amp;#039;t Nobody&amp;#039;s Bizness If I Do.&quot; The clear highlight, though, is an abandoned and often extremely funny extended scat version of &quot;How High the Moon&quot; incorporating snatches of many other jazz and pop classics. It&amp;#039;s a tour de force performance.\n\nPersonnel: \nElla Fitzgerald (vocals)\nTommy Flanagan (piano)\nKeter Betts (bass)\nBobby Durham (drums)\n\nRecorded live at the Montreux Jazz Festival, Montreux, Switzerland on July 17, 1975\n\nTrack Listing:\n1.Caravan \n2.Satin Doll\n3.Teach Me Tonight\n4.Wave\n5.It&amp;#039;s Alright With Me\n6.Let&amp;#039;s Do It\n7.How High The Moon\n8.Girl From Ipanema, The\n9.Tain&amp;#039;t Nobody&amp;#039;s Bizness If I Do\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24af32e3e8607bd620785d2c7e97d6df5461c9e5","amp;dn":"Ella+Fitzgerald+-+At+The+Montreux+Jazz+Festival+1975+RESEED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24af32e3e8607bd620785d2c7e97d6df5461c9e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,175,50,227,232,96,123,214,32,120,93,44,126,151,214,223,84,97,201,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
