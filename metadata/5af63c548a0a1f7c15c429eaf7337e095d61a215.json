In his cases, Frost is assisted by a variety of different detective sergeants, with each bringing a different slant to the particular case. Comic relief is provided by Frost's interactions with the bureaucratically-minded Superintendent Norman Mullett, played by Bruce Alexander.\n\nThe series is set in the fictional South-Midlands town of Denton, and is marked by a gritty tone. It is believed that Denton is in Oxfordshire, with many references to Reading, Oxford, and in particular, Swindon, especially in the earlier episodes, as the M4 and A417 are often seen, and the map of Swindon was seen in the control room, although a map of Reading was used occasionally. The programme is produced by ITV in Leeds, and most of the outdoor locations are shot in West Yorkshire. Several scenes are filmed in and around the city and district of Wakefield and neighbouring small towns of Pontefract and Castleford, West Yorkshire.[3] The role of Frost was notable in changing the public perception of David Jason from a predominantly comic actor to a dramatic actor.\n\nSeason 5\n\nS5, Ep1 - Feb. 9, 1997 - Penny for the Guy\nA manpower shortage and a rash of child kidnapped for ransom force a vacationing Frost back to work partnering with beautiful but ambitious DS Liz Maud.\n \nS5, Ep2 - Feb. 16, 1997 - House Calls\nJack is in charge of the case of a three month old corpse found in the coal bin of an abandoned farm house.
