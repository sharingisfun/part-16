Fred is the police agent assigned to tail and eventually bust him. To do so, Fred takes on the identity of a drug dealer named Bob Arctor. And since Substance D--which Arctor takes in massive doses--gradually splits the user&amp;#039;s brain into two distinct, combative entities, Fred doesn&amp;#039;t realize he is narcing on himself. \n\nCaustically funny, eerily accurate in its depiction of junkies, scam artists, and the walking brain-dead, Philip K. Dick&amp;#039;s industrial-grade stress test of identity is as unnerving as it is enthralling.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e7ff7313971eaa693272837476d8b8db1719e74","amp;dn":"A+Scanner+Darkly+%28e-book%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e7ff7313971eaa693272837476d8b8db1719e74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,127,247,49,57,113,234,166,147,39,40,55,71,109,139,141,177,113,158,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
