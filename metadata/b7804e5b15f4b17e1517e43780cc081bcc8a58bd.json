If nothing else, one thing is clear. Someone is about to be killedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\n\n\n\nFilm Review\nMichel Deville won the best director CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar in 1985 for this slick erotic thriller, an unusual departure for a filmmaker who has made a point of avoiding genre cinema for most of his career. Without compromising his very individual artistic style, Deville manages to compose one of the most memorable thrillers of the 1980s, rated by some as one of his most inspired and accessible films. The directorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s quirky humour and eccentric ideas for linking scenes add some disturbing undercurrents to a bizarre but thoroughly compelling story, which is based on a highly acclaimed French detective novel.\n\nChristophe Malavoy heads a distinguished cast, playing a naÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ve teacher caught up in an increasingly bewildering web of intrigue and romantic entanglement. Malavoy is a perfect casting choice ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ he plays innocence and vulnerability supremely well, and his beautiful physique serves the film well in the raunchy (but tasteful) lovemaking scenes. There are fine contributions also from Nicole Garcia (as hot as a barbecue sausage in some scenes, and just as tasty) and a spectacularly sinister trio comprising Richard Bohringer, AnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mone and Michel Piccoli (each of whom seems to be auditioning for the last place in a lunatic asylum). Seductively tense from start to finish, and ever so slightly bonkers, PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ril en la demeure is a satisfying treat for any fan of the sophisticated French thriller. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7804e5b15f4b17e1517e43780cc081bcc8a58bd","amp;dn":"French+Film+Collection%28Film+48%29+DEATH+IN+A+FRENCH+GARDEN+%281985","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7804e5b15f4b17e1517e43780cc081bcc8a58bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,128,78,91,21,244,177,126,21,23,228,55,128,204,8,27,204,138,88,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
