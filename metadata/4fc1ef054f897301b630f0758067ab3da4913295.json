In The Court Of The Crimson King (5:39)\n\nRecorded live at the Hammersmith Odeon, London, England on November 5, 1981.\n\nI am not an ELP fan by any stretch...not even close, but I am huge Gary Moore fanatic. Moore plays lead guitar and shares some of the vocal duties on this album. There are also two Gary Moore penned tracks: &quot;Nuclear Attack&quot; &amp; a song he cowrote with Phil Lynott of Thin Lizzy, &quot;Parisienne Walkways&quot;. As always, Moore does not disappoint. Thanks to Moore and his killer fretwork, most of this album leans toward the hard rock side.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fc1ef054f897301b630f0758067ab3da4913295","amp;dn":"Greg+Lake+and+Gary+Moore+GREG+LAKE+%26quot%3BKing+Biscuit+Flower+Hou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fc1ef054f897301b630f0758067ab3da4913295","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,193,239,5,79,137,115,1,182,48,240,117,128,103,171,61,164,145,50,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
