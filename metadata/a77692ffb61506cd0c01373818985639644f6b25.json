This discovery drives them to do things they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t dare to do before. What will prevail - the feeling of jealousy or passion? What to choose - revenge or forgiveness? The protagonists are looking for something to build a new life upon, but it is not easy: their every action is influenced by the fact of infidelity, and this infidelity has its own logic. ~ Venice International Film Festival\n\nSUBS: English\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2299954/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2299954/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Specs\nSource: Internet \nGroup/Ripper: HORiZON-ArtSubs/lletaif\nVideo Format: AVI/MPEG-4 Visual \nVideo Bitrate: 1845 Kbps\nFrame Rate: 25.000 fps \nAspect Ratio: 16:9\nResolution: 1024 x 576\nBits/(Pixel*Frame): 0.125\nAudio Format: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 224 Kbps\nSampling rate: 48000 Hz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a77692ffb61506cd0c01373818985639644f6b25","amp;dn":"Betrayal.2012.DVDRip.AC3.HORiZON-ArtSubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a77692ffb61506cd0c01373818985639644f6b25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,118,146,255,182,21,6,205,12,1,55,56,24,152,86,57,100,79,107,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
