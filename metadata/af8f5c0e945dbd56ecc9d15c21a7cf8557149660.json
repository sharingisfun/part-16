It was released on September 20, 2005 and became Disturbed's second consecutive number 1 debut on the Billboard 200 in the United States, shipping around 239,000 copies in its opening week. \n\nIt has been certified Platinum by the RIAA and was also the band's second number 1 release in New Zealand. It is also the first Disturbed album to not have the Parental Advisory label.\n\nTen Thousand Fists marks the first album with bassist John Moyer who replaced Steve Kmak following his dismissal in 2003. However, he was considered a session musician during the time of recording, and only became a full-time member during the tour supporting the album. It would be the band's third and final collaboration with mainstay producer Johnny K. \n\nThe album is also the first in which Disturbed's mascot, The Guy, appears on the album cover. He would later appear full-bodied in the music video for &quot;Land of Confusion&quot;.\n\nTen Thousand Fists is, as of 2010, Disturbed's second highest selling album in the United States, with sales of around 1.9 million copies. The Sickness, the band's debut CD, has shifted sales of almost 4.2 million copies in the United States. The album was dedicated to Dimebag Darrell who was murdered the year before.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t\t\n1. \t&quot;Ten Thousand Fists&quot;            \t3:33\n2. \t&quot;Just Stop&quot;                      \t3:46\n3. \t&quot;Guarded&quot;        \t                3:22\n4. \t&quot;Deify&quot;                         \t4:18\n5. \t&quot;Stricken&quot;   \t                        4:07\n6. \t&quot;I'm Alive&quot;                     \t4:42\n7. \t&quot;Sons of Plunder&quot;                \t3:50\n8. \t&quot;Overburdened&quot;                  \t5:59\n9. \t&quot;Decadence&quot;                      \t3:27\n10. \t&quot;Forgiven&quot;                      \t4:15\n11. \t&quot;Land of Confusion&quot; (Genesis cover) \t4:50\n12. \t&quot;Sacred Lie&quot;                    \t3:08\n13. \t&quot;Pain Redefined&quot;   \t                4:09\n14. \t&quot;Avarice&quot;   \t                        2:56\n15.     &quot;Monster&quot;                               4:05\n16.     &quot;Two Worlds&quot;                            3:33\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af8f5c0e945dbd56ecc9d15c21a7cf8557149660","amp;dn":"Disturbed+-2005-+Ten+Thousand+Fists%28Tour+Edition%29%5B320kbs%5D%7E%7ERenov","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af8f5c0e945dbd56ecc9d15c21a7cf8557149660","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,143,92,14,148,93,189,86,236,201,209,92,33,167,207,133,87,20,150,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
