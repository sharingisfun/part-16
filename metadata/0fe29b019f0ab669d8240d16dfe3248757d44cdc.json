Tyrone became a living portal to a cold dimension of darkness.  Tandy emerged as a generator of the light of life.  As different and as interdependent as night and day, Cloak and Dagger stalk the streets of New York as protectors of the innocent.\n\nPower Pack\nFour pre-teen brothers and sisters empowered with abilities to manipulate gravity, mass, inertia, and disintegration.  The mandate handed to them by their unworldly mentor: Save the Earth from enemies both on and off the planet.  Alex, Julie, Jack, and Katie Power are now collectively known as Power Pack.\n\nIn this tale, the two young super hero groups unite to battle against those who prey upon New York's runaways.  By following a particularly ugly path of exploitation, the heroes run up against a foe with enough power to dwarf even their combined might!\n\nCloak and Dagger v1 #1-4 (1983-1984): &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7830974/Cloak_and_Dagger_v1__1-4_(1983-1984)_[Marvel]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7830974/Cloak_and_Dagger_v1__1-4_(1983-1984)_[Marvel]&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMarvel Graphic Novel #34: Cloak and Dagger: Predator and Prey (1988): &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7831024/Marvel_Graphic_Novel__34__Predator_and_Prey_(1988)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7831024/Marvel_Graphic_Novel__34__Predator_and_Prey_(1988)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fe29b019f0ab669d8240d16dfe3248757d44cdc","amp;dn":"Cloak+and+Dagger+and+Power+Pack%3A+Shelter+From+the+Storm+%281989%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fe29b019f0ab669d8240d16dfe3248757d44cdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,226,155,1,159,10,182,105,216,36,13,22,223,227,36,135,87,212,76,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
