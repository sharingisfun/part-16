The professor discovered a skull - a Neanderthal skull. Strangely, it was covered with microscopic pollen from the flowers of thistle, groundsel, spiraea and hollyhock, among others. The same pollen dust covered the rest of the weathered skeleton, suggesting that his family and friends had deliberately gathered the flowers and laid them in bunches on the dead body. These mourners left behind the earliest known signs of man's awareness of death. Based on Doctor Selecki's findings, Neanderthals seemed to possess what we have come to call a mind.\n\n\nSeries Information\n\nComplex and deeply mysterious, the human brain is an odyssey unto itself. Take this journey into the inner workings of the mind with the guidance of scientist Dr. David Suzuki, the host of this riveting Discovery Channel documentary. This series explores the way the brain evolves from birth to adulthood; how memory works; how humans recover from brain injury; and the origins of creativity and identity.\n\n\nNarrated by David Suzuki\nWritten &amp; Directed by Masakatsu Takao &amp; Shunya Hirano\nEdited by Nobuto Sawamura &amp; Josh Berkley\nMusic by Joe Hisaishi\n\n\n\nAll credits go to PolarBear for creating and uploading.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:340fe70b03785c40f4dba51e2ea978e1670a14be","amp;dn":"The+Brain%3A+Our+Universe+Within%3B+Ep.1-Evolution+%28Discovery%2C+1994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"340fe70b03785c40f4dba51e2ea978e1670a14be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,15,231,11,3,120,92,64,244,219,165,30,46,169,120,225,103,10,20,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
