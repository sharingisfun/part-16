Generally considered to be &quot;the earliest of the modern Dystopian,&quot; it chronicles the rise of an oligarchic tyranny in the United States. It is arguably the novel in which Jack London's socialist views are most explicitly on display. A forerunner of soft science fiction novels and stories of the 1960s and 1970s, the book stresses future changes in society and politics while paying much less attention to technological changes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:486d551cb911707ec24fac4696ba1694ce91c95b","amp;dn":"The+Iron+Heel+by+Jack+London+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"486d551cb911707ec24fac4696ba1694ce91c95b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,109,85,28,185,17,112,126,194,79,172,70,150,186,22,148,206,145,201,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
