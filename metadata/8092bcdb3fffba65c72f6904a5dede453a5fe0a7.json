It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.\n\nI see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. \n\nOk pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. Surely I won't always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it's up to you to help these shares to spread.\n\n____________________________\n\n\n\nI've searched long for the DVD version of Hamlet by Kenneth Branagh.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet_(1996_film)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet_(1996_film)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFinally I found it on eMule.\n\nIt was a double DVD edition with English and Italian audio.\nUnfortunately for me the only subtitles available in it were in Italian.\n\nBut I needed also the original English subtitles: once in my life I wanted to watch the movie with the original dub and with the precise dialogues in english written below.\n\nYou know - I can babble in English, but I would be lost to listen to Shakespeare's speech with no aid. So I said: Do it yourself.\n\nI found the english subtitles on Internet.\nI demuxed the two DVDs (which were also deprived of their menus) and rebuilt them adding menus and the english subs. A sore task, believe me... but the result was worth the effort.\n\nThere you have it:\n\nPAL\n\nFor the main movie:\nEnglish, Italian audio\nEnglish, Italian subs\n\n\nFor the extras:\nEnglish audio, Italian subs\n\nThere are two ISO, each one fitting a single layer DVD and I added separately the two subtitles files in SRT text format (if there is someone so crazy amongst you who want to try to add his own subtitles: you can use the provided ones to synchronize yours).\n\nThe whole task was performed with free software available in Internet (VobEdit, DVD Lab Pro 2) and a small program of mine to shift the time offsets in SRT files for resynch.\n\nIf somebody is interested to learn how to demux and rebuild a DVD, drop me a note and I will provide you help.\n\nThe 2 DVDs work like a charm on my cheap DVD player on TV... So, enjoy :)\n\n\n(browse all my torrents:\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\nfor private posts:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&lt;/a&gt;\n\n)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8092bcdb3fffba65c72f6904a5dede453a5fe0a7","amp;dn":"Hamlet+%281996%29+by+Kenneth+Branagh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8092bcdb3fffba65c72f6904a5dede453a5fe0a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,146,188,219,63,255,186,101,199,47,105,4,165,222,222,69,58,95,224,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
