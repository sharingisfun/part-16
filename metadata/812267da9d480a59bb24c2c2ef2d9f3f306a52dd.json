This version fixed the black screen after loading from the last version uploaded to TPB so this version will fix your save like it did for mine. \n\nKeep uploading any latest version you guys find if possible and I will do the same.\n\nAlso, if they lowered the price to 10 bucks it'd be more reasonable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:812267da9d480a59bb24c2c2ef2d9f3f306a52dd","amp;dn":"Project+Zomboid+2.9.9.17+%280012a%29+%2AFixed+Torrent%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"812267da9d480a59bb24c2c2ef2d9f3f306a52dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,34,103,218,157,72,10,89,187,36,194,194,239,45,159,63,48,106,82,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
