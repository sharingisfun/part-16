A series of six episodes aired on Channel 4 in 1997, and a further episode in 2001. The series was created by Chris Morris, written by Morris, David Quantick, Peter Baynham, Jane Bussmann, Arthur Mathews, Graham Linehan and Charlie Brooker and directed by Michael Cumming.\r\n\r\nThe series satirised media portrayal of social ills, in particular sensationalism, unsubstantiated establishmentarian theory masquerading as fact, and creation of moral panics, and is a sequel to Morris's earlier spoof news programmes On the Hour (1991â€“92) and The Day Today (1994). The series starred Morris's The Day Today colleague Doon Mackichan, along with Gina McKee, Mark Heap, Amelia Bullmore, Simon Pegg, Julia Davis, Claire Skinner, John Guerrasio, Hugh Dennis and the actor Kevin Eldon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c448a06474ce91e1b79b7546378122ed37493ff4","amp;dn":"Brass+Eye","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c448a06474ce91e1b79b7546378122ed37493ff4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,72,160,100,116,206,145,225,183,155,117,70,55,129,34,237,55,73,63,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
