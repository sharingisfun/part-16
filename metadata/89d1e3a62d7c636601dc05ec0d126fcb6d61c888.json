Until now we've only known it from Brad Mehldau, Bill Evans and E.S.T. Now, with the Norwegian Helge Lien Trio, a new formation is on the way to adding new exciting soundscapes to the piano trio. Perfectly in tune with each other, this trio has presented us with Hello Troll, an album that paints lyrical- impressionistic moodscapes, and whose appeal is practically irresistable.\nA little nation with a big jazz tradition is the land of fjords and trolls. Fascinating new artists and acts sporting a huge zest for playing and an irrepressible urge for experimentation keep pushing out of Norway to conquer the rest of the jazz world. The Helge Lien Trio, who have already won a large circle of fans in Scandinavia and Japan with their five albums and inspiring live concerts, are especially significant. They maintain the balance between jazz traditions and the avantgardist art of improvisation like hardly any other classic piano trio, par excellence.\nHelge Lien, who besides his own trio project performs with other Norwegian acts like Silje Nergaard, has developed his very own unmistakeable style of trio playing with band colleagues Frode Berg (bass) and Knut AalefjÃƒÂ¦r (drums &amp; percussion). With instinctive sureness, the musicians develop a 'chamber music' jazz that stands out through its harmonically complex tone colors. Building on Bill Evans' lyrical power and the exhilaratingly melancholic playing of EsbjÃƒÂ¶rn Svensson, Lien, in constant dialogue with Berg &amp; AalefjÃƒÂ¦r, creates distinct moods on Hello Troll - moods that he presents with ease.\nDoubtlessly pianist Helge Lien, who is very skilled at playing to the gallery with his modal piano art, is one of the most exciting young talents in Scandinavia.
