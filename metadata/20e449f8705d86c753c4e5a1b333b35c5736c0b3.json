Each album will feature the track listings and\nartwork as it was originally released in the U.K. and come with\nexpanded booklets including original and newly written liner notes and\nrare photos. For a limited time, each of the Fab FourÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s 12 proper\nalbums will be ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´embeddedÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ with a brief documentary about its making.\nThe rereleases will include the BeatlesÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â  12 studio albums and Magical\nMystery Tour as well as Past Masters Vol. I and II, which will be\npackaged as one collection. All 14 discs will be available with DVDs of\nthe documentaries in a stereo box set, and a set titled The Beatles in\nMono featuring 10 discs will also be released.\n\n(Look back at the BeatlesÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â  studio albums and Rolling StoneÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s stories on\nthe LPs.)\n\nA crew of engineers at LondonÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s Abbey Road Studios have spent four\nyears working on the remasters using new technology and vintage\nequipment, the press release says, in an effort to preserve ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´the\nauthenticity and integrity of the original analogue recordingsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ and\nensure ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´the highest fidelity the catalog has seen since its original\nrelease.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶\n9/9/09 promises to be a huge day in Beatles lore, as itÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s the same day\nThe Beatles: Rock Band will hit stores. This weekend brought a bit of\nBeatles news, too, as Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr reunited onstage\nat a New York benefit for David LynchÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s Transcendental Meditation\nfoundation (see photos here). Preorders for the remasters are already\npopping up on Amazon.co.uk. Demand for Beatles remasters has steadily\nincreased since 1987, when Capitol/EMI first released the BeatlesÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â \ndiscography on CD with what many audiophile fans deemed substandard\nsound quality compared to the original vinyl.\n\nWhile it seems like other artists remaster their entire catalog every\nseveral years, Capitol/EMI have barely touched the BeatlesÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â  discography\nsince 1987, with the exception of 2004ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s The Capitol Albums, Vol. 1 box\nset, which compiled and remastered the bandÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s first four American\nreleases in stereo and mono formats. The soundtrack for the BeatlesÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â \nLove show also gave listeners a brief tease of how fantastic the bandÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s\nsongs would sound if properly remastered.\n\nThe Beatles in Mono will include the 10 albums originally mixed for\nmono release, as well as two additional discs the press release says\nfeatures similar songs to those on the Past Masters compilations. The\nmono versions of Help! and Rubber Soul will boast bonuses: the albumsÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â \noriginal 1965 stereo mixes, which have not been previously released on\nCD, per the press release. The mono collection, like the stereo one,\nwill include all original inserts and label designs, and the CDs are\ndesigned as tiny vinyl replicas.\n\nThe press release didnÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â t include news regarding a possible deal with\niTunes or another digital-music vendor to distribute the catalog\ndigitally: ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Discussions regarding the digital distribution of the\ncatalog will continue. There is no further information available at\nthis time,ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ the press release reads. Both Apple Corps. and Paul\nMcCartney have expressed reluctance to release the BeatlesÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â  music\ndigitally until all the albums had been remastered. The solo work of\neach of the four Beatles is available on iTunes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20e449f8705d86c753c4e5a1b333b35c5736c0b3","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+Newly+Remastered+2009+-SiRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20e449f8705d86c753c4e5a1b333b35c5736c0b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,228,73,248,112,93,134,199,83,196,229,161,179,51,179,92,87,54,192,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
