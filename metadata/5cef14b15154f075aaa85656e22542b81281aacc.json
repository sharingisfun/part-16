On his visit, he discovers that the population of New Orleans is miniscule, the reconstruction sparse, suicide rates are climbing, and many have not, nor know how to, return to the city that care forgot. He examines why residents had to leave, what really caused the flood and why they aren?t returning.\n\n\n\nTomorrows New Orleans: Whose City Will it Be? \n\nAmy Goodman and Greg Palast sit down to discuss who is accountable for the ongoing disastrous situation in New Orleans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cef14b15154f075aaa85656e22542b81281aacc","amp;dn":"Big+Easy+to+Big+Empty+%28FEMA+Destruction+of+New+Orleans+Greg+Pala","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cef14b15154f075aaa85656e22542b81281aacc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,239,20,177,81,84,240,117,170,168,86,86,226,37,66,184,18,129,170,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
