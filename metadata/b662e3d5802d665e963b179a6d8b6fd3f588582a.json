Hardly, as Eddie Kendricks's falsetto makes a convincing stand-in for Robinson's on remakes of &quot;You've Really Got a Hold on Me&quot; and &quot;What's So Good About Good Bye.&quot; Many of these tracks also underscore the strong doo-wop roots at the core of the Temptations' style, none more so than &quot;Baby, Baby I Need You,&quot; which barely bothers to update its '50s influences for mid-'60s ears. This minor gem comes complete with three hit singles in &quot;My Girl,&quot; &quot;The Way You Do the Things You Do,&quot; and &quot;It's Growing. \r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01.
