Good in the Kitchen (1:30)\n\nThe first two songs on Bearfoot's fourth album pretty much tell you what you need to know: they open with a fine, gently bouncing cover of Megan McCormick's &quot;Oh My Love,&quot; on which they weave silky-tight harmonies around a chord progression that sounds simple but isn't. Then they rip into a great string-band arrangement of the old-time mountain lament &quot;Single Girl,&quot; which they deliver with a sharp, vinegary flair and that weird combination of joy and regret that characterizes so much Appalachian music. On the rest of the album, those disparate influences tend to be a bit more blended: there are midtempo romantic numbers like &quot;Time Is No Medicine&quot; that combine a traditional-sounding verse with an almost poppy chorus; there are cover versions of songs by John Hiatt (the excellent &quot;Before I Go&quot;) and the Beatles (&quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;), and there are lead singer Odessa Jorgensen's deeply personal songs of heartbreak and loss (&quot;Heaven,&quot; &quot;My One True Love&quot;). And at the very end is the album's real treat: a sly, sexy, blues-inflected number called &quot;Good in the Kitchen&quot; that never says anything directly about any other room, but with its saucy rhythm and insinuating melody sure does hint more toward the bedroom","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fae3bd29b0bfb261b84e73dca71c218944daa415","amp;dn":"Bearfoot+-+Doors+And+Windows+%5B2009%5D+%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fae3bd29b0bfb261b84e73dca71c218944daa415","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,227,189,41,176,191,178,97,184,78,115,220,167,28,33,137,68,218,164,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
