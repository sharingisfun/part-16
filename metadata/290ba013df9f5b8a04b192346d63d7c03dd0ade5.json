In addition to Germany and the U.S., Inside WikiLeaks will be published simultaneously in 12 other countries.\n \nUnder the pseudonym Daniel Schmitt, Domscheit-Berg was the effective No. 2 at WikiLeaks and the organizationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most public face, after Julian Assange. In this book, he reveals the evolution, finances, and inner tensions of the whistleblower organization, beginning with his first meeting with Assange in December 2007. He also describes what led to his September 2010 withdrawal from WikiLeaks, including his disenchantment with the organizationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lack of transparency, its abandonment of political neutrality, and AssangeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s increasing concentration of power. What has been made public so far about WikiLeaks is only a small fraction of the truth. With Domscheit-BergÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s insider knowledge, he is uniquely able to tell the full story. A computer scientist who worked in IT security prior to devoting himself full-time to WikiLeaks, he remains committed to freedom of information on the Internet. Today he is working on a more transparent secret-sharing website called OpenLeaks, developed by former WikiLeaks people, to be launched in early 2011.\nAbout the Author\nDANIEL DOMSCHEIT-BERG, under the pseudonym Daniel Schmitt, was the\neffective No. 2 at Wikileaks and the organization's spokesman and most public\nface after Julian Assange.
