May no more blood be spilled from the veins of our sons and daughters in vain.\n\n\nBlack Officer in a Buffalo Soldier Regiment: The Military Career of Charles Young\n\n\nAn unheralded military hero, Charles Young (1864Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1922) was the third black graduate of West Point, the first African American national park superintendent, the first black U.S. military attachÃƒÂ©, the first African American officer to command a Regular Army regiment, and the highest-ranking black officer in the Regular Army until his death. Black Officer in a Buffalo Soldier Regiment tells the story of the man whoÃ¢â‚¬â€willingly or notÃ¢â‚¬â€served as a standard-bearer for his race in the officer corps for nearly thirty years, and who, if not for racial prejudice, would have become the first African American general.\n \nBrian G. Shellum describes how, during his remarkable army career, Young was shuffled among the few assignments deemed suitable for a black officer in a white manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s armyÃ¢â‚¬â€the Buffalo Soldier regiments, an African American college, and diplomatic posts in black republics such as Liberia. Nonetheless, he used his experience to establish himself as an exceptional cavalry officer. He was a colonel on the eve of the United StatesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ entry into World War I, when serious medical problems and racial intolerance denied him command and ended his career. ShellumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book seeks to restore a hero to the ranks of military history; at the same time, it informs our understanding of the role of race in the history of the American military.\n\n\n\nEditorial Reviews\nReview\n&quot;With quiet dignity and determination, Charles Young skillfully negotiated incredible obstacles to reach the rank of colonel. Brian G. Shellum has succeeded in capturing Young's courage and the shameful milieu of America's Jim Crow army.&quot;\n-Gregory J. W. Urwin, professor of history at Temple University\n\n&quot;Extensively researched and clearly written, Black Officer in a Buffalo Soldier Regiment places Charles Young back where he belongs, among the important figures of African Americans during the Progressive Era. --Mark Benbow, former resident historian of the Woodrow Wilson House\n\n&quot;Using solid research and little-used documentary sources, Shellum brings into sharp focus a man and officer of whom too little is known, and not near enough is remembered.&quot;\n--William W. Gwaltney, former president of the Association of African American Museums\n\n&quot;Brian Shellum traces the development, experiences, and extraordinary accomplishments of a pioneering black officer who broke through one racial barrier after another in the decades straddling the turn of the twentieth century. --Floyd Thomas, curator at the National Afro-American Museum and Cultural Center\n\nBarring the discovery of significant new documents related to Charles Young's career, Shellum's two volumes will undoubtedly stand as the definitive biography of that fine officer for many years to come--Roger D. Cunninghame, Journal of America's Military Past\n\n&quot;Shellum's book is a welcome addition to recent studies of the black military experience. . . . This is an enjoyable, commanding, and well researched work.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Bruce A. Glasrud, Journal of American History\n(Bruce A. Glasrud Journal of American History)\n\n&quot;Brian Shellum is to be congratulated for providing a first rate biography of a proud and competent officer serving during a difficult period of his country's history. &quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Thomas R. Buecker, Nebraska History\n(Thomas R. Buecker Nebraska History)\n\n&quot;Brian Shellum has filled an important void in African American biography and American military history.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Ronald G. Coleman, Utah Historical Quarterly\n(Ronald G. Coleman Utah Historical Quarterly)\n\n&quot; A valuable read for anyone with an interest in the final years of the frontier Army, American imperialism, African-Americans in military service, and American military history in general.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€A.A. Nofi, Strategypage.com\n(A.A. Nofi Strategypage.com 2011-02-17)\n\n&quot;This is a solid study of an important figure in American history. It is easy to recommend to those with an interest in military affairs, biography, and the African American experience.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Claude Clegg, Register of the Kentucky Historical Society\n(Claude Clegg Register of the Kentucky Historical Society)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“During a long and distinguished careerÃ¢â‚¬â€from being the first African-American captain in the regular army and first to be in charge of a national park, to serving in the Phillipines, chasing Pancho Villa in Mexico, and representing the United States in LiberiaÃ¢â‚¬â€Charles Young succeeded in spite of the Jim Crow prejudices permeating the American military of his time. His is a remarkable and inspiring story, though often overlooked. In this well-researched book, Brian Shellum finally gives Young the historical attention he deserves.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Dayton Duncan, author of The National Parks: AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Best Idea\n(Dayton Duncan 2009-06-19)\nFrom the Back Cover\nAn unheralded military hero, Charles Young (1864-1922) was the third black graduate of West Point, the first African American national park superintendent, the first black U.S. military attachÃƒÂ©, the first African American officer to command a Regular Army regiment, and the highest-ranking black officer in the Regular Army until his death.
