Born on April 4, 1952, in Belfast, Ireland, Moore became interested in guitar during the '60s, upon discovering such blues-rock masters as Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, and perhaps his biggest influence of all, Fleetwood Mac's Peter Green. After relocating to Dublin later in the decade, Moore joined a local rock group called Skid Row, which featured a young singer by the name of Phil Lynott, who would soon after leave the group to double up on bass and form Thin Lizzy. Skid Row persevered, however, eventually opening a show for Moore's heroes, Peter Green and Fleetwood Mac, and making such an impression on the veteran group that Green personally requested their manager help secure Skid Row a recording contract with CBS (in addition, Green sold Moore one of his most-used guitars, a maple 1959 Gibson Les Paul Standard, which would become Moore's primary instrument). \n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.93% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tVirgin\nCatalog:\t\t7243 8 46750 2 8\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\n01.Out In The Fields\n02.Over The Hills And Far Away\n03.Run For Cover\n04.Parisienne Walkways (Live)\n05.Empty Rooms\n06.The Loner\n07.Military Man\n08.After The War\n09.Cold Day In Hell\n10.Wild Frontier\n11.Still In Love With You\n12.Wishing Well\n13.Friday On My Mind\n14.Still Got The Blues\n15.Ready For Love\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c872e3c3b2bbbe062d26798b28d55072f79efb8","amp;dn":"Out+In+The+Fields%3A+The+Very+Best+Of+Gary+Moore+%281998%29+%7BFLAC%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c872e3c3b2bbbe062d26798b28d55072f79efb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,135,46,60,59,43,187,224,98,210,103,152,178,141,85,7,47,121,239,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
