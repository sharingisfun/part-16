It was released in 1970 after Lennon issued three experimental albums with Yoko Ono and Live Peace In Toronto 1969, a live performance in Toronto credited to The Plastic Ono Band. The album was recorded simultaneously with Yoko Ono's debut avant garde solo album Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band at Ascot Sound Studios and Abbey Road Studios using the same musicians and production team, and featured nearly identical cover artwork. John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band is generally considered one of Lennon's finest solo albums and a landmark recording. Rolling Stone named it the twenty-second greatest album of all time.\n\nTracklist:\n\n# Mother ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:34\n# Hold On ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:52\n# I Found Out ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37\n# Working Class Hero ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:48\n# Isolation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:51\n# Remember ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:33\n# Love ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21\n# Well Well WellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:59\n# Look At Me ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:53\n# God ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09\n# My Mummy's Dead ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:59","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:493593d08450576b7fe501621061596807e99fd1","amp;dn":"%5BVinyl+-+Flac%5D+John+Lennon+-+Plastic+Ono+Band+%40+2200-3000kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"493593d08450576b7fe501621061596807e99fd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,53,147,208,132,80,87,107,127,229,1,98,16,97,89,104,7,233,159,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
