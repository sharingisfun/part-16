Jerome of a boating holiday on the Thames between Kingston and Oxford.\n\nThe book was initially intended to be a serious travel guide, with accounts of local history along the route, but the humorous elements took over to the point where the serious and somewhat sentimental passages seem a distraction to the comic novel. One of the most praised things about Three Men in a Boat is how undated it appears to modern readers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the jokes seem fresh and witty even today.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90e92ae56952eefc77100d3da3c89f345218be6c","amp;dn":"Three+Men+in+a+Boat++%281975+-+Michael+Palin%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90e92ae56952eefc77100d3da3c89f345218be6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,233,42,229,105,82,238,252,119,16,13,61,163,200,159,52,82,24,190,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
