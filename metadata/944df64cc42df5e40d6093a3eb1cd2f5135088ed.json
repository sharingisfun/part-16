Michener\nPublished: Apr 2014\nPublisher: Random House Publishing Group\nISBN: 978-0-8041-5137-5\nFormat: Epub (Retail)\nLanguage: English\nGenres: Fiction, General, Historical\n\nIn sixteen wonderful stories, Pulitzer Prize--winning author James A. Michener burrows deep into the secret lives of animals and the hidden world of nature. Here he sheds light on nature's most awesome and beguiling handiwork, from the sublime shaping and reshaping of earth's lands and seas to a ridiculous armadillo's assault on a bit of Texas real estate that paid off handsomely. Handpicked from Michener's most popular books, these mini-masterpieces are imbued with the music of the spheres and the heartbeat of creation.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:944df64cc42df5e40d6093a3eb1cd2f5135088ed","amp;dn":"Creatures+of+the+Kingdom+by+James+A.+Michener+%28Retail%29+%7BRose88%7D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"944df64cc42df5e40d6093a3eb1cd2f5135088ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,77,246,76,196,45,245,228,13,96,147,163,235,28,210,245,19,80,136,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
