To me dance music is about transcendence. I think this mix will show it's not just a passing thing.\n  It's something that's always been there and it's something that I couldn't live without&quot;.\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99116baf03e7396eca089803c4051354f0396842","amp;dn":"Bloc+Party+-+Tapes+%282013%29+2013+Compilation+%40+320Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99116baf03e7396eca089803c4051354f0396842","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,17,107,175,3,231,57,110,202,8,152,3,196,5,19,84,240,57,104,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
