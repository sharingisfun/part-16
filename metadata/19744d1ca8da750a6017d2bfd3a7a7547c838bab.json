(For the most current updated lists of species, go to the FWS Web site [http://www.fws.gov].) Most books on endangered species focus on a specific category or a selection of species, so having an overall reference work is desirable.\n\nBecause some of the species in Beacham's Guide are also found in Canada and Mexico, the title is broadened to acknowledge this and the need to protect species and habitats wherever they occur. It also includes the species found in U.S. Commonwealth Territories such as Guam and Puerto Rico, the Caribbean islands, Central American countries, and some South American countries, along with oceanic species such as whales and turtles.\n\nSpecies are arranged taxonomically. The same introduction with instructions on using the guide is found in each volume. Each entry includes a heading with common (if there is one) and scientific names, status, when listed (and occasionally delisted), family, succinct physical description, habitat, food, reproduction, threats, and range. Many endangered species lists and publications stop there, but this work includes a color photograph of most species and several pages of information about the species. The standard information template includes description, behavior, habitat, distribution, threats, conservation and recovery, contacts, and references. The text is clearly written. The writers' sympathies with the species are apparent, and there is a realistic tone concerning the possibilities of recovery. The theme throughout is concern for habitat preservation, which can be a reminder to readers that care of special habitats can diminish the number of species that will be added to the FWS updates.\n\nVolume six contains a glossary along with a list of environmental organization addresses and two indexes. The geographic index lists the federally endangered or threatened species found in each of the countries, states, and territories mentioned above. The master index includes both common and scientific names.\n\nThe references accompanying each entry are generally U.S. FWS publications, though some others are included. Additional suggested scientific and general references would be useful. A bibliography of well-illustrated field guides for species' identification would also be a useful addition, as identification might be difficult from just the detailed descriptions and general nature of the photographs. The quality of the photographs is disappointing. Well-reproduced, audience-attracting images would add to the impact of the factual information and make this a more valuable tool for engaging public concern for endangered and threatened species. As the culture becomes more image oriented, publishers of even the most serious social and scientific information should pay ever-closer attention to photograph and illustration quality.
