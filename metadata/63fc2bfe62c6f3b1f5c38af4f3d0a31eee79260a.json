He begins in Peru, where evidence is still being uncovered that challenges preconceptions about its origins and significance. Venturing from the coast to the clouds, he reveals how the Inca transformed one of the most challenging landscapes in the world to ward off the worst effects of the climate, and created sophisticated systems of communication. He shows how one of many independent societies became a commanding empire - not through force, but by using subtle methods of persuasion.\n\n\nEpisode 2 of 2: Clash of Empires\n\nIn the concluding part, Dr Jago Cooper argues that it wasn't simply a clash of arms that destroyed the Inca, but a clash of world views. He travels from Peru to the far north of Inca territory in Ecuador to reveal how the great strengths of the empire suddenly became factors in its rapid demise. The Spanish conquest of the Inca destroyed one of the most remarkable empires in the world, yet the Inca legacy leaves a great deal for modern civilisations to learn from.\n\n===================================================================================\nSource.......: HDTV\nSize.........: 671MB\nFormat.......: mp4\nResolution...: 640x360\nVideo........: h.264, 703Kbps @ 25 fps\nAudio........: aac, 93Kbps, 48 KHz, 2 channels\n===================================================================================\n\nghost dog","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63fc2bfe62c6f3b1f5c38af4f3d0a31eee79260a","amp;dn":"The+Inca%3A+Masters+of+the+Clouds+HDTV+x264+-+GHOST+DOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63fc2bfe62c6f3b1f5c38af4f3d0a31eee79260a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,252,43,254,98,198,243,177,245,195,138,244,243,208,163,30,238,121,38,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
