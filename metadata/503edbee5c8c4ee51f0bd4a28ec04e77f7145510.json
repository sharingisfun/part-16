They are soon joined by the aged Indir Thakrun (Chunibala Debi). Hharihar can barely manage with his income. In this milieu Sarbajaya gives birth to a son Apu (Subir Bannerjee). They are desperately poor and yet there is joy and spontaneity in the lives of the two young people. Harihar goes in search of a better job and in the meanwhile Sarbajaya is hard put to make ends meet. Then while Harihar is away, disaster strikes. On a stormy night, Durga, racked by fever, breathes her last. Overnight Apu becomes an adult - his carefree days are over. When Harihar returns he is devastated. The family decide to leave the village and begin a new life elsewhere.\r\n\r\nComments:\r\nThere is no point in commenting on one of the greatest films the world of cinema has ever seen. Let me instead talk about the restoration by Criterion! Consider this. A full 40% of the film has been restored from the original celluloid which had been completely burnt in a fire. The final product is wondrous. I must have watched Pather Panchali at leas 50 times before. Yet when I watched this film, I could only marvel at the detail that I never knew existed. Each expression of Sarbajaya (Karuna Bandyopadhyay) was now visible; The Kash flowers now come to life; Harihar's (Kanu Bandyopadhyay) anguish on realising Durga is no more is etched in every line. See the stills that we have uploaded!\r\n\r\nAfter seeing these restored films I realise that Ray was a much greater artiste than I had ever imagined!\r\n\r\nUploader's Notes:\r\nThis 1080p film is exactly like the original Blu-Ray. It is untouched except for cropping it to a 4:3 size and re-encoding in x264. The audio is the original pcm monoaural sound. Do check the sample. It is from the center of the film and will give you a very good idea of the quality.\r\n\r\nA 720p version is also being uploaded separately. It has a slight degraining apart from resizing.\r\n\r\nAparajito and Apur Sansar will follow..\r\n\r\nIMDB Link: \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048473/\r\n\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/XOQ \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/XOR \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/XOm \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/XOi \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/XOl \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/XOI \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/XOd \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/XOh \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/XOb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:503edbee5c8c4ee51f0bd4a28ec04e77f7145510","amp;dn":"Pather+Panchali-BD.Rip-1080p-x.264.lpcm.Esubs-DDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"503edbee5c8c4ee51f0bd4a28ec04e77f7145510","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,62,219,238,92,140,78,229,31,11,212,162,142,192,78,119,247,20,85,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
