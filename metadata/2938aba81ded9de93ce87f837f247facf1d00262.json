I decided to publish this because I have been trying really hard to find this book. It was nowhere to be found and where it was - almost impossible to download it. But I finally got it and am glad to share it with other drawing enthusiasts. If anybody is in need, I can publish Andrew Loomis books as well (which have helped me a GREAT deal in drawing portraits, hands, human body and helped with composition, perspective as well.\n\nAnyway, hope you enjoy it and visit my blog if you are interested in drawing/painting.(myartistfactory. blogspot. com - just remove the spaces)\nP.S. - don't be too harsh. I've only recently started this endeavour again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2938aba81ded9de93ce87f837f247facf1d00262","amp;dn":"Norling+-+Perspective+made+easy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2938aba81ded9de93ce87f837f247facf1d00262","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,56,171,168,29,237,157,233,60,232,127,131,127,36,127,172,241,208,2,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
