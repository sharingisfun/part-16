The film is almost entirely composed of aerial shots of various places on Earth. It shows the diversity of life on Earth and how humanity is threatening the ecological balance of the planet. The movie was released simultaneously on June 5, 2009 in cinemas across the globe, on DVD, Blu-ray, television, and onOpening in 181 countries, the film broke the world record for the largest film release in history.[1] The film was financed by PPR, a French multinational holding company specializing in retail shops and luxury brands, as part of their PR strategy.[2][3]\n\n\nOverview\nThe documentary chronicles the present day state of the Earth, its climate and how we as the dominant species have long-term repercussions on its future. A theme expressed throughout the documentary is that of linkageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½how all organisms and the Earth are linked in a &quot;delicate but crucial&quot; natural balance with each other, and how no organism can be self-sufficient.\n\nThe first 15 minutes include footage of the beginning of the natural world, starting with single-celled algae developing at the edges of volcanic springs. By showing algae's essential role in the evolution of photosynthesis, it also explores the innumerable species of plants which all have their origins in this one-celled life form.\n\nIn the rest of the first hour of the film, the documentary takes on a more human-oriented focus, showing the agricultural revolution and its impacts, before moving on to talk about the harnessing of oil, leading to fire, industry, cities and inequality gaps like never before. It portrays the current predicament regarding cattle ranches, deforestation, food and water shortages, the use of non-renewable &quot;fossil water&quot;, the over-quarrying crisis and the shortage of energy, namely electricity. Cities such as New York City, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Shenzhen, Mumbai, Tokyo and Dubai are used as examples of the mismanagement and wastage of energy, water and food. The recession of marshlands and glaciers are shown in vast aerial shots of Antarctica, The North Pole and Africa, while mass emigration and refugee counts are shown currently and forecast in the event that these events remains unchanged.\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 29mn\nBit rate : 975 Kbps\nWidth : 608 pixels\nHeight : 336 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nResolution : 8 bits\nColorimetry : 4:2:0\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.191\n\n\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nFormat_Settings_ModeExtension : MS Stereo\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 1h 29mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 104 Kbps\nNominal bit rate : 112 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\n\nTrailer\n\nIMDB &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1014762/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1014762/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nShout out to noir and all my friends @ 1337x.org, extratorrent and Darkside RG","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ac6892a3c612ee15eb62f0b904c964bcb3c1b2c","amp;dn":"Home+%282009%29+DvdRip+%5BXvid%5D+-X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ac6892a3c612ee15eb62f0b904c964bcb3c1b2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,198,137,42,60,97,46,225,94,182,47,11,144,76,150,75,203,60,27,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
