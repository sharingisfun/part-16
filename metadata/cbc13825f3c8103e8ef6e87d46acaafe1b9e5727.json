The copy I'm releasing here is the one circulating in Cuba under Ceruto's name. Both releases are exactly the same as you can see if you check amazon.com - The reason I'm using the international title (Afro-Cuban Jazz Project) is to draw your attention ;)\n\nAbout Emiliano Salvador ---\nDuring the 1970s &amp; 1980s, pianist Emiliano Salvador sat among the jazz elite in Havana, yet he missed the fame afforded his peers such as Chucho Valdes, Paquito DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Rivera, and Arturo Sandoval. Born in the small fishing town of Puerto Padre, Salvador moved to Havana in the 1960s to study at the Escuela Nacional de Artes. His musicality grew quickly and he soon caught the attention of several important Cuban musicians. This led to jobs working with Leo Brouwer near the end of the decade and then a tenure as arranger and pianist with the influential vocalist Pablo Milanes. By the late seventies, he had developed a unique approach to Latin Jazz, driving him to form his own group and record several albums. He joined the leaders of the Cuban jazz scene such as Valdes, DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Rivera, and Sandoval, as the new voice of a generation, forging a powerfully Cuban jazz aesthetic. Much of the world missed this revolution due to the Cuban embargo, but the worldÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s jazz musicians followed his progress and often joined him on stage. As his presence began to assert itself across the world scene, Salvador died in Havana in 1992.\n\nAbout this album ---\nThis 2000 big band date re-imagines many of SalvadorÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s most famous compositions through the pen of arranger Juan Manuel Ceruto and the performances of several Cuban jazz icons. Ceruto brings SalvadorÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s compositions into a contemporary setting, maintaining their initial integrity while adding slick arrangements and modern performance concepts. In some ways the arrangements lean more towards the refined aesthetics of modern Cuban timba than the rougher exploratory nature of 1970s Cuban jazz, but if offers an opportunity to see the songs through different eyes. Numerous major names in the current Cuban jazz scene jumped at the opportunity to recognize SalvadorÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s influence on the music; saxophonist German Velazco, trombonist Juan Pablo Torres, vocalist Issac Delgado, bassist Roberto Riberon, drummer Raul Pineda, and conguero Tata Guines all participate in this heavy session. Several pianists, including Tony Perez, Hernan Lopez Nussa, and Chucho Valdes, show the lineage created by SalvadorÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s work with their creative performances. The album contains an overwhelming amount of energy that remembers SalvadorÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s legacy and then looks through it, keeping the sound firmly planted in modern Cuban jazz.\n-- The Latin Jazz Corner &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.chipboaz.com/blog/2008/06/19/reflecting-upon-influential-artists-emiliano-salvador-rereleases/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.chipboaz.com/blog/2008/06/19/reflecting-upon-influential-artists-emiliano-salvador-rereleases/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFull credits here &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,1747156,00.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,1747156,00.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTracks\n01- Angelica\n02- Para Luego Es Tarde\n03- A Puerto Padre\n04- En Una Manana De Domingo\n05- Danza Para Cuatro\n06- En Una Volanta Actual\n07- Salseando\n08- Jazz Plaza\n09- Angelica (bonus track)\n\nArtwork (300dpi scan), EAC log and CUE sheet included.\n\nTools used -\nExact Audio Copy 0.99 prebeta 3\nFLAC frontend 1.7.1\nFLAC encoder/decoder 1.2.1\nreference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari.Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbc13825f3c8103e8ef6e87d46acaafe1b9e5727","amp;dn":"Afro-Cuban+Jazz+Project+-+A+Puerto+Padre+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbc13825f3c8103e8ef6e87d46acaafe1b9e5727","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,193,56,37,243,200,16,62,142,246,232,125,70,172,170,254,27,158,87,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
