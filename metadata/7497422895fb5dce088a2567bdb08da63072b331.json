All files have been put into .package form by set, so no need to deal with the horrid installer! Due to my uncertainty about whether or not I'll be able to continue this collection in the future \n\ndue to my health I have also included the decrapped sims3packs. Use one or the other, NOT both! Using both will result in duplicate items!!! Using a sims3pack from this torrent and the one from the store will ALSO result in duplicates as the process to break the copyright protection changes the sims3pack just enough for it to appear as a totally different file!\n\nIf you aren't sure how to install a .package file for the Sims 3, please check out the tutorial on Mod the Sims via the link provided.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.modthesims.info/wiki.php?title=Sims_3:Installing_Package_Files&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.modthesims.info/wiki.php?title=Sims_3:Installing_Package_Files&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease don't just leech, seed for a while after you download!\n\nThese package files as well as the original torrent were compiled by rachelstoolbox onYou are welcome to post the files for download off ofbut I request you acknowledge the files were not your own creation. I will only be offering any support via the torrent on KickAss Torrents.\n\nTil next month!\n\nRachel\n\nFAQ\n\nQ: What happened to the annual package files?\nA: I combined them to help the game run more efficiently. Instead of the 5 annual packages there are now 3 larger package files instead.\n\nQ: Do I need to install this 'Fixes' package file?\nA: If you want any of the 'Premium Content' to work, yes you do. It used to be combined with the most recent annual file but separating it makes it easier for me to check which version is included. Expect to replace the file you have anytime new 'Premium Content' is in the torrent.\n\nQ: The directions on Mod the Sims are for mod files?\n\nA: Every mod posted at Mod the Sims is in the form of a .package file, the exact same thing provided in this torrent. Installation is exactly the same.\n\nQ: What if I want to use the .sims3pack files instead?\nA: If you have the game installed double clicking any .sims3pack file will open the launcher, which will install it. Remember, if you use the package files the only files you need to install this way are the Worlds and Buildings.\n\nQ: Why does the game tell me some of the files have mod scripts?\nA: Starting in June 2011 EA/Maxis started putting 'Premium' items on the Sims Store. Unlike any common items on the store, these 'Premium' items add new functionality to the game, which EA/Maxis wrote in the form of a script, which just so happens to be the same thing the vast majority of modders will do. The scripts in packages found in this torrent originate from EA/Maxis only.\n\nChanges in v1.3 package and sims3pack files\n\nFiles have been recompressed to lower torrent's total size. Conversion will be done gradually over several months instead of all at once. The only change to 1.3 files is the compression algorythym of the .zip files\n\nChanges in v1.2.1 package files\n\nvarious items have been moved into other package files to eliminate conflicts\n\nChanges in v1.2 package and sims3pack files\n\nRun through more recent versions of s3rc and decrapify'\nRigfix run on new files\n\nChanges in v1.1 package files\n\nRigfix has been rerun since it wasn't effective when initially run","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7497422895fb5dce088a2567bdb08da63072b331","amp;dn":"Complete+Sims+3+Store+January+2013+%28package+and+decrapified+sims","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7497422895fb5dce088a2567bdb08da63072b331","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,151,66,40,149,251,93,206,8,138,37,103,189,176,141,166,48,114,179,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
