The new approach adopts an argument that economics is central to government initiatives concerning sustainable construction.\n\nThis edition has been expanded to include the latest debates regarding the private finance initiative, value management, off-site manufacture, the credit crunch, the 2008 OFT investigation into contractors colluding and sustainable construction. The opportunity has also been taken to update the data, examples, readings, and references.\n\nThis invaluable textbook is essential reading across a wide range of disciplines from construction management and civil engineering to architecture, property and surveying.\n\n\n# Paperback: 336 pages\n# Publisher: Routledge; 2 edition (November 5, 2008)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0415462290\n# ISBN-13: 978-0415462297","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9768a71e4f7fe5f6237adb3a8ea419db11f1cb88","amp;dn":"Construction+Economics-A+New+Approach%2C2nd+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9768a71e4f7fe5f6237adb3a8ea419db11f1cb88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,104,167,30,79,127,229,246,35,122,219,58,142,164,25,219,17,241,203,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
