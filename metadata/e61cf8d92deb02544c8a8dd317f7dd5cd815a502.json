This allows us to acquire the exact kind of sounds we require to create the best experience within the simulator. In the case of this pack, the majority of sounds were recorded from a class 150 at Bristol St. Philip's Marsh depot. As well as excellent audio quality, Pro packs include separate cab and exterior sounds because as anyone who's been in the cab of one of these units knows, there is really quite a difference! Finally, all efforts have been made to make sure the sounds are as realistic as possible. One way we have achieved this is by employing realistic volume levels which means that the volume differential between idling and full power is prototypically large so as to make you really feel the power of the engine when it revs up.\n\nWhat is exactly featured?\n\nEngine start up/shut down\n\nDistinctive engine rev-up\n\nUser operable two-tone horn using the space-bar and 'B' key\n\nBrake release/application sounds (150/156 &amp; 153 specific versions)\n\nBogie run sounds to give the sensation of movement\n\nBrake rub sound\n\nCab instrument sounds\n\nJointed track sounds (Bo-Bo 2-axles)\n\nFlange sounds\n\nSeparate cab sounds\n\nRealistic sound fading effects\n\nAccurate volume levels. This means the quietest sounds are as quiet as they should be in relation to the loudest as per reality.\n\nEssential Requirements\n\nThomson Interactive/Oovee Class 150 \n\nAND/OR\n\nJust Trains Class 153 Advanced\n\nAND/OR\n\nOovee Class 156\n\n\n\nScenario Requirements\n\nPlease note that these items are only required if you would like to use the scenario supplied with this pack.
