The series was the first to introduce the step-by-step protocols approach that has become the standard in all biomedical protocol publishing. Each protocol is provided in readily-reproducible step-by-step fashion, opening with an introductory overview, a list of the materials and reagents needed to complete the experiment, and followed by a detailed procedure that is supported with a helpful notes section offering tips and tricks of the trade as well as troubleshooting advice.\r\n\r\nThese hallmark features were introduced by series editor Dr. John Walker and constitute the key ingredient in each and every volume of the Methods in Molecular Biology series. Dr. Walker's editorial overview is what makes the MiMB series one of the most valuable resources for all biological scientists. The high-quality protocols are all peer-reviewed, comprehensive and reliable.\r\n\r\n \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_in_Molecular_Biology\r\n \nhttp://pastebay.org/index.php/view/97209331","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c41ba540248af240be34f5bf6a9e581c8e7ef3ee","amp;dn":"Methods+in+Molecular+Biology+%28Vol.+1-1130%29+1984-2013+%5Bjournals%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c41ba540248af240be34f5bf6a9e581c8e7ef3ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,27,165,64,36,138,242,64,190,52,245,191,106,158,88,28,142,126,243,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
