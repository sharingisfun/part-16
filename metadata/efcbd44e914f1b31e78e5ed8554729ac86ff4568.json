Grandfatherly Wind\n\n320 Kbps MP3 (highest quality MP3)\n\nAnd as always:\n\n**No Malware Certified**\n\nNote: If you like Susumu Hirasawa, the composer, consider buying some of his albums, as it doesn't go through an RIAA-Filter that takes most of the money made from a sold copy. \n\nThat's right, you'll actually be SUPPORTING a music artist this time around.\n\n\nNOTE: I can now confirm someone is intentionally flipping around with the torrent and sending bad packet data out, so some songs might come in corrupt. Re-download that song if necessary.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efcbd44e914f1b31e78e5ed8554729ac86ff4568","amp;dn":"Paranoia+Agent+OST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efcbd44e914f1b31e78e5ed8554729ac86ff4568","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,203,212,78,145,79,27,49,231,142,94,216,85,71,41,172,134,255,69,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
