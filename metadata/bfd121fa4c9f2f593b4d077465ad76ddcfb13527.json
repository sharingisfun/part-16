He harnessed the Country and Pop influences of has past and created a new kind of Country that appealed to different generations of fans and crossed over into the Pop market like no other artist before him. The album's centerpiece was an all-stops-out Southern-rock cover of Billy Joel's &quot;Shameless.&quot; Another hit single, &quot;Rodeo,&quot; boasted a slinky Creedence-style groove. Brooks's propensity for sentimental folk-pop clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s surfaced on the ballads &quot;What She's Doing Now&quot; and &quot;The River.&quot; But &quot;We Bury the Hatchet&quot; and &quot;Papa Loved Mama&quot; were tongue-in-cheek attempts at honky-tonk and truck-drivin' boogie.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 9\nArtist: Garth Brooks\nAlbum: Ropin' the Wind\nYear: 1991\nGenre: Country\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfd121fa4c9f2f593b4d077465ad76ddcfb13527","amp;dn":"Garth+Brooks+-+Ropin%5C%27+The+Wind+%5BFLAC-1991%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfd121fa4c9f2f593b4d077465ad76ddcfb13527","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,209,33,250,76,159,47,89,59,77,7,116,101,173,118,221,207,177,53,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
