Detroit-born, Florida-raised Dennis Yost, who joined on drums and moved into the singer's spot, came from a Jacksonville-area band called the Echoes; he was just old enough to remember '50s R&amp;B when it was current and, among many other groups, loved the Five Satins; and in addition to playing the skins, he sometimes liked to sing when the calls came for a '50s number like &quot;In the Still of the Night.&quot; After his own group broke up in the mid-'60s, Yost joined a band called Leroy &amp; the Moments, which included Wally Eaton (bass, vocals), James Cobb (guitar), and Joe Wilson (keyboards). His arrival, along with the changing times, also signaled a change in the group's name -- as there was no &quot;Leroy&quot; anyway, that could go, and the Moments was already taken, so, taking their lead from Yost's Classic-model drum kit, they became the Classics.\n\nTheir sound was extremely diverse by all accounts -- they could cover most of the Top 40 note-perfect, which was ideal for audiences in Jacksonville but didn't necessarily give them much to work with as a recording act. Part of their act included a tribute to the Four Seasons, who were still burning up the charts in those days -- ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:hifqxqw5ldte~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:hifqxqw5ldte~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nRaven's Atmospherics 1966-1975: A Complete Career Collection has as much music as a fan of the Atlanta-based blue-eyed soul/AM pop collective could want. At 29 tracks, it has just two more than Taragon's Best of Dennis Yost &amp; the Classics IV, but anybody looking for anything other than &quot;Traces,&quot; &quot;Stormy,&quot; and &quot;Spooky&quot; would be satisfied with either. Fans looking for a more succinct compilation should check out EMI's reissue of the streamlined Very Best of Classics IV.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:0nfixq80ldse&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:0nfixq80ldse&lt;/a&gt;\n\nReviews and for sale here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000668QW&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000668QW&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
