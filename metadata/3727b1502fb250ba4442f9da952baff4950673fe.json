Tenth Edition.\n\n\n\nTO THE READER\nComputers are no longer just for specialists. Today, computing is not just a\nprofession and a hobby; it is also a tool used in virtually all human activities.\nThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve compiled this book of background knowledge. Its purpose\nis to tell you the things other people think you already know.\nWe design this book to have a convenient size so it can be easily carried\naround. In compiling a book this size, we have had to be selective. The\nquickest way to identify a word that you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t find in a book is probably to\ndo a web search (see SEARCH ENGINE). Also, some terms are almost always\nabbreviated, and in that case you should look for the abbreviation rather\nthan the full term.\nMuch has changed since the first edition of this book was published\nmore than twenty years ago. New terms are being invented every day. We\nregularly update the book, and this edition contains new entries on a variety\nof topics including Windows Vista and Mac OS X. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve also cut out\nmaterial that was showing its age.\nTerms are marked slang or humorous if they are seldom used in serious\nwriting. They are marked as jargon if, in our estimation, they are somewhat\npretentious new names for old concepts and are not likely to endure. We\nprovide occasional Usage notes to explain grammar, spelling, and proper\nuse of words, such as the exact difference between disc and disk.\nThroughout, we use SMALL CAPITALS to mark important words that are\ndefined elsewhere in this book. By following cross-references, you can\nquickly find many entries that pertain to whatever interests you. Here are\nsome entries you may wish to start with to learn about particular topics:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Internet culture: CHAT ROOM\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ right and wrong: COMPUTER ETHICS\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ safe computing: COMPUTER SECURITY\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ solving exceptionally difficult problems: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ productively using computers in business and daily life: APPLICATION\nPROGRAM\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ listening to music: DIGITAL MUSIC\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ taking pictures: DIGITAL CAMERA\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ creating web pages: HTML\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ writing computer programs: PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ software that controls a computer: OPERATING SYSTEM\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ how a computer works: COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ networking and the Internet: INTERNET\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ connecting computers wirelessly: WIRELESS COMMUNICATION\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ electronic components: TRANSISTOR\n\n\n\nBe sure to notice the visual dictionary of symbols at the end of the book.\nIf you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know what ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â£ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‹â€  or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ is called, donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t worry; you can look it\nup there.\nAll four of us want to thank The University of Georgia and Seattle\nPacific University for access to facilities and for accommodating us as we\nworked on the project. We also want to thank Robert Downing for help with\n1960s data processing terminology; Sharon Covington for help with current\nInternet culture; and Brantley Coile of Coraid, Inc., for permission to adapt\nmaterial from CoraidÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s glossary of networking and data storage.\nMany of the words used in this book are registered trademarks.
