The first five chapters treat elementary concepts such as divisibility, congruence and arithmetical functions. The topics in the next chapters include Dirichlet's theorem on primes in progressions, Gauss sums, quadratic residues, Dirichlet series, and Euler products with applications to the Riemann zeta function and Dirichlet L-functions. Also included is an introduction to partitions. Among the strong points of the book are its clarity of exposition and a collection of exercises at the end of each chapter. The first ten chapters, with the exception of one section, are accessible to anyone with knowledge of elementary calculus; the last four chapters require some knowledge of complex function theory including complex integration and residue calculus.\n\n\nSynopsis\nThis introductory textbook is designed to teach undergraduates the basic ideas and techniques of number theory, with special consideration to the principles of analytic number theory.
