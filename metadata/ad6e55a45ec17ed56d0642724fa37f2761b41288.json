Fai is struggling to find a way to bring his pregnant wife and young daughter over the Hong Kong border from Shenzhen to give birth to their second child, even though he crosses the border easily every day working as a chauffeur for Anna. Anna, in contrast, is struggling to keep up the facade of her ostentatious lifestyle into which she has married, after the sudden disappearance of her husband amid financial turmoil. Their two lives collide in a common space, the car.\n\nDirector: Flora Lau\nWriter: Flora Lau\nStars: Stephanie Che, Kun Chen and Lawrence Cheng\n\nBends.2013.720p.BluRay.x264-DoKtor\n\nFormat: MPEG-4\nFrame rate: 24.000 fps\nWidth: 1 280 pixels\nHeight: 688 pixels\nAudio Format: AAC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad6e55a45ec17ed56d0642724fa37f2761b41288","amp;dn":"Bends.2013.720p.BluRay.x264-DoKtor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad6e55a45ec17ed56d0642724fa37f2761b41288","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,110,85,164,94,193,126,213,109,6,66,114,79,163,127,39,97,180,18,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
