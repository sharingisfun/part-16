M. Berens\nAndrews UK Limited | 2010 | 340 Pages | ISBN: 1466268751 | EPUB/PDF | 5.88/11.0 Mb &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Myths-Legends-Ancient-Greece-Rome/dp/1466268751&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Myths-Legends-Ancient-Greece-Rome/dp/1466268751&lt;/a&gt;\nPDF conversion is mine.\n\nThe author sets before the reader a lifelike picture of the deities of classical times as they were conceived and worshipped by the ancients themselves, and thereby to awaken in the minds of young students a desire to become more intimately acquainted with the noble productions of classical antiquity. The aim was to render the legends, which form the second portion of this work, a picture of old Greek life; its customs, superstitions, and princely hospitalities, for which reason they are given at somewhat greater length than is usual in works of this kind.\nThis anthology is a thorough introduction to classic literature for those who have not yet experienced these literary masterworks. For those who have known and loved these works in the past, this is an invitation to reunite with old friends in a fresh new format. From Shakespeare s finesse to Oscar Wilde s wit, this unique collection brings together works as diverse and influential as The Pilgrim s Progress and Othello. As an anthology that invites readers to immerse themselves in the masterpieces of the literary giants, it is must-have addition to any library.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4f95230de3670575e57868147596b6ce62b6ec2","amp;dn":"The+Myths+and+Legends+of+Ancient+Greece+and+Rome+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4f95230de3670575e57868147596b6ce62b6ec2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,249,82,48,222,54,112,87,94,87,134,129,71,89,107,108,230,43,110,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
