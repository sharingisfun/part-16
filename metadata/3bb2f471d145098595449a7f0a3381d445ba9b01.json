A version known as The Best of John Denver with the same tracklisting[3] was released in some countries.\n\n\n\nThe collection included material from his earlier days as a songwriter (going back to 1965 on &quot;For Bobbie&quot;) to his later hit &quot;Rocky Mountain High&quot;. Indeed many of these tracks were not hits per se, but as Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote for Allmusic, &quot;the[se] were [the] songs that defined him.&quot;\nMoreover, Greatest Hits is important historically because it contained new, revisionist recordings of several songs. Notable new versions included &quot;Leaving on a Jet Plane&quot;, &quot;Starwood in Aspen&quot;, &quot;Follow Me&quot;, &quot;Rhymes and Reasons&quot;, &quot;The Eagle and the Hawk&quot;, &quot;Sunshine On My Shoulders&quot; and &quot;Poems, Prayers, and Promises&quot;.\nDenver explained this himself in the liner notes by saying that he had picked the numbers most requested in his concerts, but that &quot;I felt that some of these songs had grown a bit, that I am singing better than I was four or five years ago, and that I would like to treat some of the songs a little differently than I had in the original recordings.&quot;\nAfter its release these versions were used for airplay despite differing in subtle but important ways from the original versions; generally, they were more polished, featured a more mature-sounding Denver, included strings, and were extended somewhat.\nGreatest Hits climbed by the spring following to the top of the Billboard 200 pop albums chart, went platinum, and was one of the first albums world-wide to sell over 10 million copies. Overall it is easily the best-selling album of his career in the United States, being certified 9-times platinum by the RIAA.\n\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\nFor the newly recorded tracks:\nJohn Denver - vocals, acoustic guitar\nSteve Weisberg - guitars (Dubious: Check Eric Weissberg)\nDick Kniss - bass\nFrank Owens - piano\nHerb Lovelle - drums\nGary Chester - percussion\n\n\nTracklist [not the one on Wikipedia]:\n\n\n1) Take Me Home, Country Roads\n2) Eagles and Horses\n3)A little further North\n4) Potters Wheel\n5)Windsong\n6)ThanksToYou\n7)The Chosen Ones\n8)Raven's Child\n9) Annie's Song\n10) Higher Ground\n11) Ancient Rhymes\n12)Earth Day Every Day\n13) I watch you Sleeping\n14) Sunshine on my Shoulders\n15) Stonehaven Sunset\n\nNOT A VinylRip.\nPlease Seed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bb2f471d145098595449a7f0a3381d445ba9b01","amp;dn":"John+Denver+Very+Best+Of+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bb2f471d145098595449a7f0a3381d445ba9b01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,178,244,113,209,69,9,133,149,68,154,127,10,51,129,212,69,186,155,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
