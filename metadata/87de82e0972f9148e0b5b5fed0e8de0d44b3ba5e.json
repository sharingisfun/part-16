They are perhaps best remembered for their five biggest songs &quot;My Girl (Gone Gone Gone)&quot;, &quot;I Believe&quot;, &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do&quot;, &quot;Fly At Night&quot; and &quot;Lonesome Mary&quot;. The band's lineup has changed numerous times, though Bill Henderson has constantly remained a fixture, and Chilliwack continues to tour across Canada.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLook In Look Out is the twelfth and, to date, last studio album by the Canadian rock band Chilliwack, released in 1984.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87de82e0972f9148e0b5b5fed0e8de0d44b3ba5e","amp;dn":"Chilliwack+-+Look+In+Look+Out+%5B1984%5D%5B2005%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87de82e0972f9148e0b5b5fed0e8de0d44b3ba5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,222,130,224,151,47,145,72,224,181,181,254,208,232,222,13,68,179,186,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
