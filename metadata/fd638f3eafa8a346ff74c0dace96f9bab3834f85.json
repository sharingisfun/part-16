Huck escapes his civilized life when he arranges his own ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmurderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and turns back into the backwoods, downriver yokel he started as, and in the process springing a slave, Jim, from bondage.\nHuck and Jim experience life as a series of tableaus as the river sweeps them through small towns on their way South. At each stop, Huck engages his talent for mixing fact with bald-faced lies to endlessly get himself out of situationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and of course, putting him into others!\nMuch has been written about the statement Twain is making about slavery in this book, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s really secondary to the story. The facts of how black people were treated in this period give Huck and Jim their license for life on the run. Modern listeners will be intrigued by the unencumbered life of the pair; they make do with coffee, fish from the river, and little else (but of course, when they do need something extra, they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t mind helping themselves to it without recourse to money!)
