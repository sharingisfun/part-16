And then, suddenly, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no joke. For two years, the strategy they devise works like a charmÃ¢â‚¬â€until they kidnap the wrong man. \nNow two groups are after themÃ¢â‚¬â€the law, in the form of veteran state investigator Kirk Stevens and hotshot young FBI agent Carla Windermere, and an organized crime outfit looking for payback. As they crisscross the country in a series of increasingly explosive confrontations, each of them is ultimately forced to recognize the truth: The real professionals, cop or criminal, are those who are willing to sacrifice everything. \n\nCriminal Enterprise (#2): From the outside, Carter TomlinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life looked perfect: a big house, pretty wife, two kidsÃ¢â‚¬â€a St. Paul success story. But Tomlin has a secret. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lost his job, the bills are mounting, and that perfect life is hanging by a thread. Desperate, he robs a bank. Then he robs another.\n\nAs the red flags start to go up, FBI Special Agent Carla Windermere homes in on Tomlin from one direction, while Minnesota state investigator Kirk Stevens picks up the trail from another. The two cops havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t talked since their first case together, but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all going to change very quickly.\n\nBecause Carter TomlinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decided he likes robbing banks. And itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not because of the money, not anymore. Tomlin has guns and a new taste for violence. And heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not quitting anytime soon.\n\nKill Fee (#3): The new Stevens and Windermere novel from one of the most dazzlingly acclaimed new writers in crime fiction.\n\nThe billionaire picked a heck of a way to die.\n\nOn a beautiful Saturday in downtown Saint Paul, Minnesota, state investigator Kirk Stevens and his occasional colleague FBI special agent Carla Windermere witness the assassination of one of the stateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wealthiest men. The shooter is a young man, utterly unremarkableÃ¢â‚¬â€except in his eyes. There is something very wrong in his eyes.\n\nAnd itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only the beginning. The events of that sunny springtime day will lead Stevens and Windermere across the country, down countless blind alleys, and finally to a very flourishing twenty-first-century enterprise: a high-tech murder-for-hire social media website. But just who has the dead-eyed shooter targeted next . . . and whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s choosing his victims? ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s where things get complicated. \n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready.
