Original bassist Chris &quot;Pint Glass&quot; Stewart left \n\nbefore any recordings were made, and was replaced by original drummer Hake.\n\nKeenan left in 1994 to start his own group, the Telstar Ponies and was replaced \n\nby guitarist Steven Haddow. In the same year, the band released their first \n\nalbum Twin Action on Creation Records and in 1995 they released their second \n\nalbum, Formanka.\n\nTheir third album, Year Zero, which saw them take a more experimental sample-\n\nbased approach, was released in early 1997. The remixed single &quot;Stay&quot; was given \n\nmainstream radio play and gave them their only UK Top 75 hit single (peaking at \n\n#59 in March[1]). They were subsequently dropped by Creation during the \n\nrecording of what was to be their fourth studio release. Although Alan Hake has \n\nstated that Creation Records allowed the band to keep the master tapes to this \n\nalbum, no plans to officially release it have materialised. Hake went on to \n\nco-found the Must Destroy record label.\n(Wikipedia)\n\n\n\n18 Wheeler Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Year Zero\nLabel: Creation Records Ã¢â‚¬â€œ CRECD 192\nFormat: CD, Album\nCountry: UK\nReleased: 1997\nGenre: Electronic, Rock\nStyle: Brit Pop, Downtempo\nTracklist:\n1 \t\tThe Hours And The Times \t3:40 \t\n2 \t\tCrabs \t3:27 \t\n3 \t\tStay \t4:16 \t\n4 \t\tGrease \t3:19 \t\n5 \t\tProzac Beats \t4:51 \t\n6 \t\tThe Ballad Of Paul Verlaine \t5:36 \t\n7 \t\tEverythings Dead \t3:40 \t\n8 \t\tRetard \t2:22 \t\n9 \t\tBlue Eyed Son \t2:24 \t\n10 \t\tDen Dagen, Den Sorgen \t5:26 \t\n11 \t\tPlanesong \t1:56","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53668af577d53cbdea36016f5f773288968de3da","amp;dn":"18+Wheeler+-+Year+Zero+%281997%29+Mp3+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53668af577d53cbdea36016f5f773288968de3da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,102,138,245,119,213,60,189,234,54,1,111,95,119,50,136,150,141,227,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
