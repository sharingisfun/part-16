Its successor, Windows Server 2008, was released on February 4, 2008. It is based on Windows XP, basically becoming an enhanced version of XP. According to Microsoft, Windows Server 2003 is more scalable and delivers better performance than its predecessor, Windows 2000.[5]\n\nWindows Vista, as shipped, was developed based solely on Windows Server 2003 source code.\n\n\n*Windows Server 2003 support is ending July 14, 2015\n\n\nNote (6/20/15):\n===============\n\nThis version actually has seeders. I found this on another site in torrent format. It currently has 4 seeds and is downloading for me @ 1.5MiB/s\n\nThis is an unedited version. The only other version I found on here was.. shady. I only took the time to upload this here so others can get a image if needed. End of lifetime support is coming up and it may be needed.\n\n\nContent:\n========\n\n\n06/20/2015  10:10 PM       636,483,584 en_sbs_2003_r2_cd1.iso\n06/20/2015  10:10 PM       666,593,280 en_sbs_2003_r2_cd2.iso\n06/20/2015  10:10 PM       641,054,720 en_sbs_2003_r2_cd3.iso\n06/20/2015  10:10 PM       299,462,656 en_sbs_2003_r2_cd4.iso\n06/20/2015  10:10 PM       180,264,960 en_sbs_2003_r2_cd5.iso\n06/20/2015  10:10 PM       469,899,264 en_sbs_2003_r2_prem_tech_cd1.iso\n06/20/2015  10:10 PM       602,462,208 en_sbs_2003_r2_prem_tech_cd2.iso\n06/20/2015  10:10 PM       580,034,560 en_sbs_2003_r2_tech_a.iso\n\nTrial Key:\n==========\nBBGC6-TXDG9-J9CDW-JXK3R-GTMMB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25d1bce766d32eaaf56fe994170d767311234cac","amp;dn":"Server+2003+SBS+R2+SP2+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25d1bce766d32eaaf56fe994170d767311234cac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,209,188,231,102,211,46,170,245,111,233,148,23,13,118,115,17,35,76,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
