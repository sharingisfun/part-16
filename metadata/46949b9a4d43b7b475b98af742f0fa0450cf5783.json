The album was their first with guitarist Adrian Smith and their last with vocalist Paul Di'Anno, who was sacked after problems with his stage performance arose due to his alcohol and cocaine use. This was also the first Iron Maiden album made with veteran producer Martin Birch, who went on to produce their next eight albums before retiring after Fear of the Dark in 1992.\n\nThe song &quot;Wrathchild&quot; is the only regularly played track from the album, appearing in almost all their concert tours. Killers is the only Iron Maiden album to feature two instrumentals and was written almost exclusively by Steve Harris,  with only minor assistance from the rest of the band (the title track and &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; being the only other songs to receive additional writing credits). Each song, with the exception of &quot;Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;, based on the story of the same name by Edgar Allan Poe,  and &quot;Prodigal Son&quot;, had been written in the years prior to the recording of their debut album,  although none were recorded professionally until the Killers sessions, apart from &quot;Wrathchild&quot; (an early version recorded in 1979 was featured on the Metal for Muthas compilation). \n\nThe US edition, which came out a few months after it did in the UK, was initially released on Harvest Records/Capitol Records and subsequently on Sanctuary Records/Columbia Records. &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; was also added to the album.\n\nThe Killer World Tour was the tour in support of the album and would feature the band's earliest shows in the US, the first being at The Aladdin, Las Vegas in support of Judas Priest. \n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;The Ides of March&quot; (instrumental) \t  \t1:46\n02. \t&quot;Wrathchild&quot;   \t  \t2:55\n03. \t&quot;Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;   \t  \t4:19\n04. \t&quot;Another Life&quot;   \t  \t3:23\n05. \t&quot;Genghis Khan&quot; (instrumental) \t  \t3:09\n06. \t&quot;Innocent Exile&quot;   \t  \t3:54\n07. \t&quot;Killers&quot;   \tHarris, Di'Anno \t5:01\n08. \t&quot;Prodigal Son&quot;   \t  \t6:12\n09. \t&quot;Purgatory&quot;   \t  \t3:20\n10. \t&quot;Twilight Zone&quot;   \tMurray, Harris \t2:33\n11. \t&quot;Drifter&quot;   \t  \t4:49\n\nBonus Disc [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Women in Uniform&quot; (originally by Skyhooks) \tGreg Macainsh \t3:07\n02. \t&quot;Invasion&quot;   \tHarris \t2:38\n03. \t&quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; (live) \t  \t6:55\n04. \t&quot;Running Free&quot; (live) \tHarris, Di'Anno \t3:07\n05. \t&quot;Remember Tomorrow&quot; (live) \tHarris, Di'Anno \t5:44\n06. \t&quot;Wrathchild&quot; (live) \tHarris \t2:52\n07. \t&quot;Killers&quot; (live) \tHarris, Di'Anno \t4:50\n08. \t&quot;Innocent Exile&quot; (live) \tHarris \t3:46","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46949b9a4d43b7b475b98af742f0fa0450cf5783","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+Killers+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46949b9a4d43b7b475b98af742f0fa0450cf5783","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,148,155,154,77,67,183,180,117,185,138,247,66,240,250,4,80,207,87,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
