Tour guide Master Yoda leads a group of rambunctious Jedi younglings through Senate chambers when he senses a disturbance in the Force. Summoned to help save the Republic, he discovers that one of the younglings, Ian, has secretly boarded his ship... and young Ian has a taste for adventure! Meanwhile, C-3PO and R2-D2 are put in charge of the boisterous group and find themselves in over their heads. As the evil Sith prepare to wreak havoc, it's up to Yoda and the Droids to ensure that their young charges aren't torn to bits. \n\n\n\nGreetings Realuploads","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e702449ea34e616bef32573a65f84b4c2c886c4f","amp;dn":"Lego+star+wars+the+padawan+menace+NORDIC+audio+and+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e702449ea34e616bef32573a65f84b4c2c886c4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,2,68,158,163,78,97,107,239,50,87,58,101,248,75,76,44,136,108,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
