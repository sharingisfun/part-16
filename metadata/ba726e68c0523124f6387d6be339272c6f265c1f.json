Battle rages across the North, the king of the Northmen still stands firm, and there's only one man who can stop him. His oldest friend, and his oldest enemy: it's time for the Bloody-Nine to come home.\n\nWith too many masters and too little time, Superior Glokta is fighting a different kind of war. A secret struggle in which no one is safe, and no one can be trusted. As his days with a sword are far behind him, it's fortunate that he's deadly with his remaining weapons: blackmail, threats, and torture. \n\nJezal dan Luthar has decided that winning glory is too painful an undertaking and turned his back on soldiering for a simple life with the woman he loves. But love can be painful tooÃ¢â‚¬â€œand glory has a nasty habit of creeping up on a man when he least expects it. \n\nThe king of the Union lies on his deathbed, the peasants revolt, and the nobles scramble to steal his crown. No one believes that the shadow of war is about to fall across the heart of the Union. Only the First of the Magi can save the world, but there are risks. There is no risk more terrible, than to break the First Law...&quot;\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\n-Ventricle","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba726e68c0523124f6387d6be339272c6f265c1f","amp;dn":"The+Last+Argument+of+Kings+-+Joe+Abercrombie+-+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba726e68c0523124f6387d6be339272c6f265c1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,114,110,104,192,82,49,36,246,56,125,107,227,57,39,44,111,38,92,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
