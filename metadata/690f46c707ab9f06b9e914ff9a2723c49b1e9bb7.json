The original, Catalog #3BR 120, is not to be confused with this release, Catalog #3BR 148.  \n\nEven if you have &quot;a copy&quot; of this title, you may not know what version you have, particularly if it was obtained in trade, when the \nwrong artwork could have been substituted.\n\nOverall, a personal Favorite EC show of all time, and as always ...\n\nPLAY IT LOUD, AND ENJOY!\n\n~Geetarz, May 2010\n\nwww.geetarz.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:690f46c707ab9f06b9e914ff9a2723c49b1e9bb7","amp;dn":"Eric+Clapton+-+1990-01-24+-+Royal+Albert+Hall+in+London%2C+England","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"690f46c707ab9f06b9e914ff9a2723c49b1e9bb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,15,70,199,7,171,159,6,185,233,20,255,154,39,35,196,155,30,155,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
