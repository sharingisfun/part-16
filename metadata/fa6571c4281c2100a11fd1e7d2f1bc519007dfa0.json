One world had ended and a new, uncertain one was beginning. Regime change had come on a global scale: across Asia (including China, Korea, Indochina, and the Philippines, and of course Japan) and all of continental Europe. Out of the often vicious power struggles that ensued emerged the modern world as we know it.\n\nIn human terms, the scale of transformation is almost impossible to imagine. Great cities around the world lay in ruins, their populations decimated, displaced, starving. Harsh revenge was meted out on a wide scale, and the ground was laid for much horror to come. At the same time, in the wake of unspeakable loss, the euphoria of the liberated was extraordinary, and the revelry unprecedented. The postwar years gave rise to the European welfare state, the United Nations, decolonization, Japanese pacifism, and the European Union. Social, cultural, and political Ã¢â‚¬Å“reeducationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was imposed on vanquished by victors on a scale that also had no historical precedent. Much that was done was ill advised, but in hindsight, as Ian Buruma shows us, these efforts were in fact relatively enlightened, humane, and effective.\n\nA poignant grace note throughout this history is BurumaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story. Seized by the Nazis during the occupation of Holland, he spent much of the war in Berlin as a laborer, and by warÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s end was literally hiding in the rubble of a flattened city, having barely managed to survive starvation rations, Allied bombing, and Soviet shock troops when the end came. His journey home and attempted reentry into Ã¢â‚¬Å“normalcyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ stand in many ways for his generationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s experience.\n\nA work of enormous range and stirring human drama, conjuring both the Asian and European theaters with equal fluency, Year Zero is a book that Ian Buruma is perhaps uniquely positioned to write. It is surely his masterpiece.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa6571c4281c2100a11fd1e7d2f1bc519007dfa0","amp;dn":"Ian+Buruma+-+Year+Zero%3A+A+History+of+1945+%5Bepub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa6571c4281c2100a11fd1e7d2f1bc519007dfa0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,101,113,196,40,28,33,0,161,31,209,231,210,241,188,81,144,7,223,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
