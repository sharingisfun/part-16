Firth of Forth and Isle of Skye\r\nPaul Murton explores the islands scattered in the Firth of Forth. He discovers that these seemingly peaceful islands have a dramatic history of war, from Medieval English raids on the monastic island retreat of Inchcolm to the first air raid attack on Britain above Inchgarvie. Paul learns about the strategic importance of Inchkeith's defences during two world wars, before heading to the Bass Rock to learn more about the history of prisoners incarcerated on the unforgiving rock, with 160,000 gannets for company. Next, Paul Murton goes over the sea to Skye to visit the home of celebrated writer and naturalist Gavin Maxwell, before scaling the famous Cuillin mountain Am Bastier. On the nearby Isle of Raasay, he learns about Calum's Road - the amazing true story of the determined crofter Calum Macleod, who singlehandedly built a road to connect his isolated community.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 24 (~4534Kbps)\r\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrame Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 44.1KHz (~128Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 56 mins\r\nNumber of Parts: 4\r\nPart Size: 1.88 GB (average)\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b30f6b215969bf33f0f91af746072dd5c700a56d","amp;dn":"BBC+Grand+Tours+of+the+Scottish+Islands+Series1+3of4+1080p+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b30f6b215969bf33f0f91af746072dd5c700a56d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,15,107,33,89,105,191,51,240,249,26,247,70,7,45,213,199,0,165,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
