If someone provides a copy of unedited tapes I'll readdress the versions , but for now what you see is what you get. Heavily edited and processed songs in a jumbled order.\n\nThis is the best version to date that I have heard, but I have yet to find a copy of the Lingasong disc\nLive! at the Star-Club in Hamburg: Germany; 1962'.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.moptop.org/music/docs/beatles/boots/cd/flash103.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.moptop.org/music/docs/beatles/boots/cd/flash103.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo:\n\nPublisher: Flash Light\n\nReference : Flash103\n\nMatrix: Flash 103 78878\n\nDate : 1996\n\nMade In : Germany\n\nBooklet &amp; packaging : Tri digipak - Detailed sleeve notes.\n\nEven sports a bar code\n\nTotal duration: 65:42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
