For the past five years now, it's become somewhat of a Christmas time tradition for me to gather a collection of music which I tend to play more often than not during the month of December.  I do a lot of driving, so this disc has found a permanent residence in my vehicle's disc changer.\n\nPerhaps the songs are really nothing special to many of you, but since 2009, I've been tweaking this collection.  Year in and year out I'll add new songs to the collection, delete some songs, reorder them, maybe find better versions by different Artists, etc.  And since 2009, the collection has grown from about 25 songs to 75 songs today.\n\nSo, for what it's worth, I thought I'd torrent my playlist through this &quot;Various - 2013 - Piratebay Christian Music Mixtape, Vol 3&quot; title.  Maybe as much as 7 or 8 out of 10 of these songs are popular versions, but there are still some less-heard goodies embedded within that I hope will bring joy to your hearts.\n\nGlory To The King of Kings,\nTorrentTracts - December 2013\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8f2a8263b9d4dc81dee954f7f81520b83f838b2","amp;dn":"Various+-+2013+-+Piratebay+Christian+Music+Mixtape%2C+Vol+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8f2a8263b9d4dc81dee954f7f81520b83f838b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,242,168,38,59,157,77,200,29,238,149,79,127,129,82,11,131,248,56,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
