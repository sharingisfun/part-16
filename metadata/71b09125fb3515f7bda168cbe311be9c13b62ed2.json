The common theme of this album, her first since the acclaimed Hill of Thieves in 2009, is affairs of the heart and Dillon, singing perhaps a semitone lower than a decade ago, is on superb form.\nThe album is produced and arranged by husband Sam Lakeman and features guest vocals from Timothy B Schmit (The Eagles), American singer/songwriter Aoife O'Donovan and English folk musician John Smith. Among the treats on this 11-song album are River, Run, a cover of a song from Nineties Lancaster indie pop act Suddenly Tammy!, and Shotgun Down The Avalanche, a take on Shawn Colvin's country music song. But Dillon is at heart a very fine folk singer, something she shows again with her touching take on the classic As I Roved Out.
