By any name, Slim was a masterful blues pianist with a distinctive style. This satisfying drummerless two-fer was originally issued as 1960s albums Just Blues and No Strain, all songs written by the prolific pianist, recorded in the same session and re-released the year after he died in Paris in 1988. The 23-tune collection opens with &quot;Beer Drinking Woman&quot; (with sly Funeral March quotes), followed by one of his patented, totally believable spoken intros. Fully nine of these tracks feature just piano and voice, illustrating beyond a doubt that this bluesman was the real deal who needed no help to get his point across. ~ Mark Allan\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.

Nice Stuff (3:28 )\n\n* Just Blues [Released July 1961]\nRecorded: 26 April 1960-15 November 1960\n\n\nCut during one session in November of 1960, Memphis Slim's Just Blues features the urbane singer both alone at the piano and backed by guitarist Lafayette Thomas and jazz bassist Wendell Marshall; harp player &quot;Harpie&quot; Brown joins the party for two cuts. One of a handful of stellar albums Slim cut for Prestige's Bluesville label, the 12-track set offers a particularly pleasant way to check out the pianist's tasty keyboard work and wide-ranging topical bent: From booze drinking and sexual innuendo to real lowdown blues, Slim tackles the varied terrain with aplomb.\n\nNo Strain (Released1962)\n\n\nCut from the same 1960 sessions as Slim's equally fine Just Blues album, No Strain finds the pianist and singer effortlessly working through another set of solo piano and combo pieces. Backed by either harmonica player &quot;Harpie&quot; Brown or the tandem of guitarist Lafayette Thomas and bassist Wendell Marshall, Slim turns in a highly enjoyable set of seasoned performances. Both at the keyboard and the mic, alone or with company, Slim shows why he was one of the most urbane and original of blues giants.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0213d68845cd1ed7c5ae85558ae3891633d9036","amp;dn":"Memphis+Slim+Raining+The+Blues%28blues%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0213d68845cd1ed7c5ae85558ae3891633d9036","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,33,61,104,132,92,209,237,124,90,232,85,88,174,56,145,99,61,144,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
