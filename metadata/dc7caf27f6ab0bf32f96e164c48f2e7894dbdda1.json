Dying to Read (2012)\nCate Kinkaid is just dipping her toe into the world of private investigating until one of the many rÃƒÂ©sumÃƒÂ©s she has floating around lands her a real job. All she has to do is determine that a particular woman lives at a particular address. Simple, right? When the big and brooding house happens to contain a dead body, this routine PI job turns out to be anything but simple. Is Cate in over her head?\n\n2. Dolled Up to Die (2013)\nWhen Cate Kinkaid receives a frantic call about a triple homicide, she drives to the scene against her better judgment--aren't triple homicides more up the police department's alley?--only to find that the victims are not quite who she expects. Now she has a new rule to add to those she's learned in her short stint as an assistant private investigator: always find out if the victims actually have human DNA. Because these three do not. \nBut who would shoot this nice lady's dolls? What possible reason could the shooter have? And then there's the startling discovery of another victim, who definitely does have human DNA . . . \nWith tension that is matched only by humor, &quot;Dolled Up to Die&quot; is the exciting second book in Lorena McCourtney's The Cate Kinkaid Files. Mystery fans won't find a place to stop and take a breath in this fast-paced and intriguing tale.\n\n3. Death Takes a Ride\nCate Kinkaid arrives at H&amp;B Classic Auto Restorations to give a friend a ride. But, as usual, trouble finds Kate even there--this time in the form of one dead man, one wounded man, and what appears to be a pretty obvious case of self-defense. Owner Matt Halliday wants to hire her, but not for this case. Instead, Cate is charged with finding a man who owns a particular motorcycle Matt would like to buy. As her search progresses, she begins to suspect that the shooting in Matt's office may not have been as cut-and-dried as it appeared.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc7caf27f6ab0bf32f96e164c48f2e7894dbdda1","amp;dn":"Lorena+McCourtney+-+Cate+Kinkaid+Files+%283+books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc7caf27f6ab0bf32f96e164c48f2e7894dbdda1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,124,175,39,246,171,11,243,47,150,225,100,196,143,46,120,148,219,221,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
