He owned his life to the composer who eventually became his greatest friend: Dmitri Shostakovich, who first convinced him to leave Warsaw for Moscow, and then sent letters to high officials that prevented Vainberg's execution. (Or at least, long enough until Stalin's sudden death ended the possibility.) His style was likened to that of Shostakovich in the 1950s and 1960s, but more recent studies have shown that the composers were working together to these results, often with daily correspondence and &quot;top that!&quot; contests. Vainberg's earliest works sound more like his Miaskovsky, while his late ones have a Spartan, restrained manner of expressiveness with a bone-deep sense of tragedy that owes nothing to anyone else.\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nTwo bios enclosed.
