Featuring a previously-hidden cache of intimate family letters, this documentary reveals the secret childhood of Queen Victoriaâ€™s grandson, the future Kaiser Wilhelm II. Wilhelm was born with a permanently paralysed arm: a disability considered shameful at the time. His mother wrote that she was â€˜hauntedâ€™ by the idea of him â€˜remaining a crippleâ€™ and insisted that he hide his paralysed arm throughout his life. Cruel and crude attempts to â€˜cureâ€™ him poisoned their relationship and helped turn the boy, born to unite the Royal families of Britain and Germany, into the man who tore them apart and led Germany into the First World War.\r\n\r\nSecret.History.Queen.Victoria.And.The.Crippled.Kaiser.PDTV.XviD.FiSH\r\nAVi | MP3 VBR | 461MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ab8a62ffe8ba5942d9a1647798ab3c2f0ba9682","amp;dn":"+Secret+History+Queen+Victoria+And+The+Crippled+Kaiser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ab8a62ffe8ba5942d9a1647798ab3c2f0ba9682","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,184,166,47,254,139,165,148,45,154,22,71,121,138,179,194,240,186,150,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
