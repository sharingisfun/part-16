The property and mansion have been claimed to be hauntedÃ¢â‚¬â€including by Winchester herselfÃ¢â‚¬â€since construction commenced in 1884. Under Winchester's day-to-day guidance, its &quot;from-the-ground-up&quot; construction proceeded around the clock, without interruption, until her death on September 5, 1922, at which time work immediately ceased. The cost for such constant building has been estimated at about US $5.5 million (equivalent to over $75 million in 2012). It now serves as a tourist attraction.\nThough it's possible she was simply seeking a change of location and a hobby during her lengthy depression, other sources claim that while consulting The Boston Medium, Winchester came to believe her family and fortune were haunted by the ghosts of people who had fallen victim to Winchester rifles, and that only by moving West and continuously building them a house could she appease these spirits. Located at 525 South Winchester Blvd. in San Jose, California, the Queen Anne Style Victorian mansion is renowned for its size and utter lack of any master building plan.\n\nInstallation instructions:\n1.
