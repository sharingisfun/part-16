Over the years it has been published by Pacific Comics, Eclipse Comics, Epic Comics, Image Comics and Dark Horse Comics.\n\nGroo was one of the first widely successful creator-owned comics, one of the few successful humorous comic books (outside Archie Comics) during its time, and one of the longest running collaborations in comic book history.\n\nGroo first appeared as a parody of the brutal sword &amp; sorcery heroes who were popular at the time of his creation in the 1970s, especially Conan the Barbarian as presented in Marvel Comics. Groo is an ugly large-nosed buffoon of surpassing ignorance who constantly misunderstands his surroundings.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b47b2b61cfe151973a74c9e9caae10688edd9ba8","amp;dn":"Groo+The+Wanderer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b47b2b61cfe151973a74c9e9caae10688edd9ba8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,123,43,97,207,225,81,151,58,116,201,233,202,174,16,104,142,221,155,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
