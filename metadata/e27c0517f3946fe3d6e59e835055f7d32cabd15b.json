The emphasis is heavy on the U.K.-based Asian Underground scene, which is oriented towards electronic dance music, and many of the familiar names are here, often remixing one another--Fun-Da-Mental, Transglobal Underground, Kingsuk Biswas (a.k.a. Bedouin Ascent), Talvin Singh, Banco de Gaia, and DJ Cheb i Sabbah. Most of the music from that camp is excellent and a nice introduction to their style. By contrast, Fila Brazillia and Bob Holroyd wobble the line between ambient and dull. One real eye-opener is State of Bengal's remix of the track &quot;Delerium&quot; by Toronto-based Ken Ramm's Euphoria. Euphoria's approach is studio-crafted music in the contemporary electronic style, but acoustic slide guitar is the primary sonic material. The other contributors from outside the U.K. dance scene are more of a mixed bag. Qawwali master Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan appears in a piece from a collaboration with Michael Brook, but his forays into modern sounds always conveyed a lot less of the ecstatic qualities of music than his more traditional records. Shankar's trademark Indian jazz fusion closes the CD and should appeal to fans of his style. --Bob Bannister ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e27c0517f3946fe3d6e59e835055f7d32cabd15b","amp;dn":"VA+asian+travels+vol.+1+%28six+degrees+collection%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e27c0517f3946fe3d6e59e835055f7d32cabd15b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,124,5,23,243,148,111,227,214,229,158,131,80,85,247,211,44,171,209,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
