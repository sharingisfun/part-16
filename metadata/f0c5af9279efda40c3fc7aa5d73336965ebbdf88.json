When it came to recording a follow-up, the band booked into The Manor studios in Oxfordshire with Steve Brown again producing the album. By the end of October 1986 the album was recorded, the masters assembled and it was given the title Ã¢â‚¬ËœPeaceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. However, the band werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t happy with the final results which seemed too polished. Appreciating the rawness of Run-D.M.C.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœWalk This WayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, the band contacted producer Rick Rubin to re-mix the lead track, Ã¢â‚¬ËœLove Removal MachineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Rubin agreed to work with the band but only on condition that the track was entirely re-recorded. The result was a sparse, dry, riffing version that captured the sonic excitement the band were looking for. Enthused by the results, the decision was made to abandon the expensive Ã¢â‚¬ËœPeaceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ recordings and re-record the entire album in New York with Rick Rubin. The new tracks would become The CultÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s third album, re-titled Ã¢â‚¬ËœElectricÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, and a multi-million seller. Tracks from Peace were used as single B-sides and some of the alternative versions were issued on an early CD Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Manor Sessions, but it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t until the limited Ã¢â‚¬ËœRare CultÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ box set in 2000 that fans got to hear the full album correctly sequenced. The box rapidly sold out so Peace has been unavailable for 13 years.\n\nGeneral\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nTOTAL File size                          : 117 MiB\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Constant\nOverall bit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nAlbum                                    : Electric Peace\nAlbum/Performer                          : The Cult\nPerformer                                : The Cult\nGenre                                    : Hard Rock\nRecorded date                            : 2013\nWriting library                          : LAME3.98r\nComment                                  : [mR12]\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nWriting library                          : LAME3.98r\nEncoding settings                        : -m j -V 4 -q 3 -lowpass 20.5\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0c5af9279efda40c3fc7aa5d73336965ebbdf88","amp;dn":"The+Cult+-+Electric+Peace+%7B2013-Album%7D+%5BCD2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0c5af9279efda40c3fc7aa5d73336965ebbdf88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,197,175,146,121,239,218,64,195,252,122,165,215,51,54,150,94,187,223,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
