The eighteenth animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics, it was the last Disney animated feature released while Walt Disney was alive.\n\nIt is part of the 'English Cycle' of Disney animated films, which include Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, 101 Dalmatians, The Jungle Book, Robin Hood, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh and The Rescuers.\n\nThe film is based on the novel of the same name, at first published in 1938 as a single novel. It was then later republished in 1958 as the first book of T. H. WhiteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tetralogy The Once and Future King. From MerlinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s statement that The Times will not come out for another 1200 years, it may be extrapolated that the film is set circa A.D. 558.\n\nCast\n\n    * Rickie Sorensen, Richard Reitherman and Robert Reitherman as Arthur/Wart\n    * Karl Swenson as Merlin\n    * Junius Matthews as Archimedes the Owl\n    * Sebastian Cabot as Sir Ector\n    * Norman Alden as Sir Kay\n    * Martha Wentworth as Madam Mim / Old Lady Squirrel\n    * Alan Napier as Sir Pellinore\n    * Thurl Ravenscroft as Black Bart\n    * Barbara Jo Allen as Scullery Maid\n    * Ginny Tyler as Little Girl Squirrel\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:461d9bff5c898edd1b4d070b8e2d9cbdca783b42","amp;dn":"The+Sword+in+the+Stone+-+Disney+-+1963+AVI+plus+all+extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"461d9bff5c898edd1b4d070b8e2d9cbdca783b42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,29,155,255,92,137,142,221,27,77,7,11,142,45,156,189,202,120,59,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
