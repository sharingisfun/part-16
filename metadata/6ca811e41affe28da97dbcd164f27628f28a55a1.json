For John Rain, it was the lessons of love, war, and betrayal he learned in Tokyo in 1972.\r\n\r\nFresh from the killing fields of Southeast Asia, Rain works as a bagman under the watchful eye of his CIA handler, delivering cash to corrupt elements of the Japanese government. But when a delivery goes violently wrong, Rain finds himself in the crosshairs of Japanâ€™s most powerful yakuza clan. To survive, Rain strikes a desperate deal with his handler: take out a high-profile target in the Japanese government in exchange for the intel he needs to eliminate his would-be executioners.\r\n\r\nAs Rain plays cat and mouse with the yakuza and struggles to learn his new role as contract killer, he also becomes entangled with Sayaka, a tough, beautiful ethnic Korean woman confined to a wheelchair. But the demands of his dark work are at odds with the longings of his heartâ€”and with Sayakaâ€™s life in the balance, Rain will have to make a terrible choice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ca811e41affe28da97dbcd164f27628f28a55a1","amp;dn":"Graveyard+of+Memories+%28A+John+Rain+Novel%29+-+Barry+Eisler+%28epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ca811e41affe28da97dbcd164f27628f28a55a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,168,17,228,26,255,226,141,169,125,188,209,100,242,118,40,242,138,85,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
