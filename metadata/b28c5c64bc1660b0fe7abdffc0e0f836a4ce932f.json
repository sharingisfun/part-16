Musician &quot;Satanic Tyrant Werewolf&quot; (real name Lauri PenttilÃƒÂ¤ began recording under this name in 1999. The band's lyrics deal mainly with nature, folklore, Satanism, and &quot;occult and warlike themes&quot;.\nimage\nThe idea for Satanic Warmaster was first formed in 1998, while Werewolf was performing vocals for the band Horna, along with his other musical projects. At that time Werewolf was still known under the name &quot;Nazgul&quot;. During this time he released three demos for Satanic Warmaster, Bloody Ritual and Marsch Zu Neuen Zeitaltern in 1999, and Gas Chamber in 2000. He left Horna in 2001 to focus on Satanic Warmaster and also because of personal reasons, citing his frustration and need to create his own art.\nimage\nIn a 2003 interview for the Finnish metal webzine Imperiumi, Werewolf explained his personal beliefs in a detailed manner: &quot;Pan-European traditional Satanism is a comprehensive ideological and philosophical alignment, which aims for the bettering of an individual and the most beneficial elbow space through the acknowledgement (and partially harnessing) of the dark and destructive (and thus initially creative) force of nature and cosmos. Excluding anything has never been the best option. Satanism constitutes my world view about 100%&quot;.\n\nIn a 2004 interview, Werewolf stated, &quot;The influence [of the Third Reich] cannot be denied, some of the most advanced social and political ideas were created during the iron regime of the Reich. Of course I am interested and feel strong sympathy for the ideals of that time.&quot; In response to the question, &quot;When a band sings about the hatred to christians then everything is okay, but when a band starts to sing about the jews instead of christians then some people (even some &quot;die-hard&quot; Satanists!) seem to have some problems with it... IsnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t it ridiculous?&quot; Werewolf agreed, &quot;It is fucking ridiculous. It is okay to mock the 'King of the Jews' but not mock 'god's chosen race'. Fuck Jahweh and fuck Judaism&quot;. When asked his opinion about the September 11 attacks, he said that it was &quot;maybe even a hoax and a way for the JewSA to wage their useless wars on anyone they want.&quot;\n\nIn January 2008, the band was linked to National Socialist black metal in Finnish newspapers due to its &quot;Carelian Pagan Madness&quot; tour with the German NSBM band Absurd and Greek NSBM band Der StÃƒÂ¼rmer, whose member Hjarulv Henker called Satanic Warmaster one of the few Satanic bands to have his &quot;full support&quot; because they are &quot;supporting (and take part in) our Cause.&quot;, although pagan and satanic bands usually reject each other. Both the tour organizers and Satanic Warmaster denied the allegations. Werewolf called the political accusations groundless and described the lyrical interpretations as insane.\n\nIn 2009, Ylioppilaslehti, the biggest student newspaper in Finland, published an article about Black Metal where Werewolf explained his motivations even further. About the rise of new subgenres such as &quot;NSBM&quot; to the side of traditional Black Metal he commented on the matter, &quot;Times change, shock values get deteriorated and intensified. If you want your voice to be heard, it isn't always enough that you say, Hail Satan! It is of no importance to anyone anymore. You must comprehend new aesthetics and in certain cases it can be found surprisingly near.\n\nIt's ridiculously easy, how you can get people to fixate on your music by these means&quot;. Also about the morals and the polarities of Black Metal and NSBM he said, &quot;Black Metal is negative. For an average person Black Metal in all it's immorality and nihilism should be a million times worse than neo-nazism or anything like that&quot;.\n\n\n\nBand Members\n\nWerewolf Vocals, Guitar, Keyboards\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nStrength And Honor (2001)\nOpferblut (2003)\nCarelian Satanist Madness (2005)\nNachzehrer (2010)\nFimbulwinter (2014)\n\n\n\nFimbulwinter (2014)\n\n\n\n1.
