ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf God wanted you to know about that, it would have been in the Bible,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he is told, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½so stick to worrying about your own salvation.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ But thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not good enough for Edward T. Martin, and thus begins a seekerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s quest across 4000 miles of India in search of answers about where Jesus was during the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHidden YearsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from ages 12 to 30. The New Testament is silent on those years, however in India there is an ancient tradition that young Jesus joined a caravan and took the Silk Road to the East, where He lived with both Hindus and Buddhists before returning to begin His ministry. To what extent are these traditions based on evidence, and why does the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPopeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of Hinduism now insist that Jesus was in India? Why does Professor Elaine Pagels of Princeton University, a world-renowned Biblical scholar, say we cannot rule this out? Scholars and religious authorities are joined in this film by the Dalai Lama and an Apostolic Nuncio of Pope John Paul II. You will hear all sides, and you will be shocked and surprised by some of the answers offered for the BibleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s silence about JESUS IN INDIA.\n\nHARDCODED ENGLISH SUBTITLES FOR NON ENGLISH PARTS :)\n\ncredit SPRiNTER &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nUPLOAD DEDICATED TO redchaos2354, Motley Crue, jdpennington, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, xxxUniversalAbsurdityxxx, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld &amp; many, many more &amp; to all the awesome people who are sharing (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY)***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE even the CRITICIZERS :)\n\n*****help what we can with haiti or any other in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53827ff865c02a1d7032fcfa6f2dfc0888984d1f","amp;dn":"Jesus.In.India.2008.DVDRip.XviD-SPRiNTER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53827ff865c02a1d7032fcfa6f2dfc0888984d1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,130,127,248,101,192,42,29,112,50,252,250,111,45,252,8,136,152,77,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
