Whether providing practical advice, discussing writing and writers or observing the state of the writing world, Scalzi lays it out in a sharp, no-nonsense way that assumes you want the lay of the land, without all the huggy-squeezy hand-holding.\n\nNotes on the writing life, unvarnished views of writers and books and (yes) even some practical advice: It's all here. \n\nGenre: Non-Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:749d213aee37594183cb81f76ef85af9b6bc626c","amp;dn":"You%27re+Not+Fooling+Anyone+When+You+Take+Your+Laptop...","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"749d213aee37594183cb81f76ef85af9b6bc626c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,157,33,58,238,55,89,65,131,203,129,247,110,248,90,249,182,188,98,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
