We'll also learn how to bake and export the entire animation from MotionBuilder for use in other software. \n\nBy the end of this set of lessons, you'll be equipped with the skill-set needed to confidently animate character interactions with props in MotionBuilder.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f02163197e60e9b352a39da14a3d571ad113b98","amp;dn":"Digital+Tutors+-+Animating+with+Props+in+MotionBuilder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f02163197e60e9b352a39da14a3d571ad113b98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,2,22,49,151,230,14,155,53,42,57,218,20,163,213,113,173,17,59,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
