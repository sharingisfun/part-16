Meiko \nstarted at the famed Hotel CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© in Hollywood, where she \nwas a waitress and performer before local and national \nbuzz allowed her to put aside her drink tray for good. 'I \nretired from the waitressing field earlier this year,' \nshe muses. 'Getting up in the morning and writing songs \nis my new profession.' Listen to her songs in a single \nsetting and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s clear that sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s very good at her job. \nA songwriter with a keen eye and vivid narrative gift, \nMeiko collects jagged moments and devastating \nconversational flashes and turns them into deceptively \nsimple tunes with hushed, gentle tones and stunning \ndetailed imagery.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43483ffc1a6a33be1ea1a92f27adb78870b33e37","amp;dn":"Meiko","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43483ffc1a6a33be1ea1a92f27adb78870b33e37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,72,63,252,26,106,51,190,30,161,169,47,39,173,183,136,112,179,62,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
