His parents divorced when he was a year old, and he was raised mainly by his aunt. After studying at the University of Wisconsin, Fearing moved to New York City where he began a career as a poet and was active in leftist politics. In the Twenties and Thirties, he published regularly in The New Yorker and Poetry and helped found The Partisan Review, while also working as an editor, journalist, and speechwriter and turning out a good deal of pulp fiction, including pornography. A selection of FearingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s poems has been published as part of the Library of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s American Poets Project.\n\nGeorge Stroud is a hard-drinking, tough-talking, none-too-scrupulous writer for a New York media conglomerate that bears a striking resemblance to Time, Inc. in the heyday of Henry Luce. One day, before heading home to his wife in the suburbs, Stroud has a drink with Pauline, the beautiful girlfriend of his boss, Earl Janoth. Things happen. The next day Stroud escorts Pauline home, leaving her off at the corner just as Janoth returns from a trip. The day after that, Pauline is found murdered in her apartment.\n\nJanoth knows there was one witness to his entry into PaulineÃ¢â‚¬â€s apartment on the night of the murder; he knows that man must have been the man Pauline was with before he got back; but he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know who he was. Janoth badly wants to get his hands on that man, and he picks one of his most trusted employees to track him down: George Stroud, who else?\n\nHow does a man escape from himself? No book has ever dramatized that question to more perfect effect than The Big Clock, a masterpiece of American noir.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains following book in ePUB format:\n\n* The Big Clock - Kenneth Fearing, introduction by Nicholas Christopher (NYRB Classics)\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nybooks.com/books/imprints/classics/the-big-clock/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nybooks.com/books/imprints/classics/the-big-clock/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Fearing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Fearing&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c82acc0a01aabf6f9372334bf06a2e351c6825ca","amp;dn":"Kenneth+Fearing+-+The+Big+Clock+%28NYRB+Classics%2C+2006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c82acc0a01aabf6f9372334bf06a2e351c6825ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,42,204,10,1,170,191,111,147,114,51,75,240,106,46,53,28,104,37,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
