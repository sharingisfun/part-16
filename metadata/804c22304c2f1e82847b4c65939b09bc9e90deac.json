Of course it doesn't.\nBut it does cover probably 80% of what you need to know. You can find the remaining 20%, the 20% that is\nunique to you, in Apple's online documentation.\nThis book, then, acts as a foundation. It covers the Objective-C language and the major design patterns of\nCocoa. It will also get you started with the three most commonly used developer tools: Xcode, Interface\nBuilder, and Instruments. After reading this book, you will be able to understand and utilize Apple's online\ndocumentation.\nThere is a lot of code in this book. Through that code, I will introduce you to the idioms of the Cocoa\ncommunity. My hope is that by presenting exemplary code, I can help you to become not just a Cocoa\ndeveloper, but a stylish Cocoa developer.\nThis third edition includes technologies introduced in Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5. These include Xcode 3,\nObjective-C 2, Core Data, the garbage collector, and CoreAnimation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:804c22304c2f1e82847b4c65939b09bc9e90deac","amp;dn":"Cocoa+Programming+for+Mac+OS+X%2C+Third+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"804c22304c2f1e82847b4c65939b09bc9e90deac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,76,34,48,76,47,30,130,132,123,76,101,147,155,9,188,158,144,222,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
