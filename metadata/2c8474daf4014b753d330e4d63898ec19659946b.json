He is best known as the lead guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter for the British rock band Dire Straits, which he co-founded with his brother, David Knopfler in 1977. After Dire Straits disbanded in 1995, Knopfler went on to record and produce seven solo albums, and, as with his previous tenure, produced many hit songs.[1] He has composed and produced film scores for eight films, including Local Hero (1983), Cal (1984), The Princess Bride (1987), and Wag the Dog (1997).[2] In addition to his work with Dire Straits and as a solo artist and composer, Knopfler has recorded and performed with many prominent musicians, including Chet Atkins, The Chieftains, Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Bryan Ferry, Emmylou Harris, Jools Holland, Sonny Landreth, Van Morrison, Steely Dan, Sting, and James Taylor, sometimes working as a session musician. He has produced albums for Tina Turner, Bob Dylan, and Randy Newman.\nKnopfler is a fingerstyle guitarist and was ranked 27th on Rolling Stone magazine's list of 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.[3] Knopfler and Dire Straits have sold in excess of 120 million albums to date.[4][5] A four-time Grammy Award winner, Knopfler is the recipient of the Edison Award and the Steiger Award, and holds three honorary doctorate degrees in music from universities in the United Kingdom.[6][7]\nContents [hide] \n1 Early life (1949Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1976)\n2 Dire Straits (1977Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1995)\n3 Solo career (1996Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n4 Country music\n5 Personal life\n6 Musical style and equipment\n6.1 Musical style\n6.2 Guitars\n6.3 Effects\n6.4 Amplifiers\n7 Honours and awards\n8 Knopfler's influence\n9 Discography\n9.1 Dire Straits albums\n9.2 Solo albums\n9.3 Soundtrack albums\n9.4 Collaborative albums\n9.5 Produced albums\n9.6 Additional albums\n10 Guest singles\n10.1 Music videos\n11 References\n12 External links\nEarly life (1949Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1976)[edit source | editbeta]\n\nMark Freuder Knopfler was born on 12 August 1949 in Glasgow, Scotland, to an English mother and Hungarian father. His father was an architect and a chess player, whose anti-fascist sympathies and Jewish parentage [8] forced him to flee from his native Hungary in 1939 even though Knopfler later described his father as a Marxist Agnostic.[9] The Knopflers originally lived in the Glasgow area and Mark Knopfler's younger brother David was also born there, on 27 December 1952. The family re-settled in Knopfler's mother's home town of Blyth, Northumberland, in North East England when he was 7 years old. Mark Knopfler had attended Bearsden Primary school in Scotland for two years, but both brothers attended Gosforth Grammar School. Inspired by his uncle Kingsley's harmonica and boogie-woogie piano playing, Mark wanted to buy an expensive Fiesta Red Fender Stratocaster just like Hank Marvin's, but had to settle for a Ã‚Â£50 twin-pick-up HÃƒÂ¶fner Super Solid.[10] During the 1960s, he formed and joined schoolboy bands and listened to singers like Elvis Presley and guitarists Chet Atkins, Scotty Moore, B.B King, Django Reinhardt, Hank Marvin, and James Burton. At 16 he made a local TV appearance as part of a harmony duo, with his classmate Sue Hercombe.[10]\nIn 1968, after studying journalism for a year at Harlow College,[10][11] Knopfler was hired as a junior reporter in Leeds for the Yorkshire Evening Post.[12] Two years later, he decided to further his studies, and went on to graduate with a degree in English at the University of Leeds.[13] In April 1970, while living in Leeds, Knopfler recorded a demo disk of an original song he'd written, &quot;Summer's Coming My Way&quot;. The recording included Knopfler (guitar and vocals), Steve Phillips (second guitar), Dave Johnson (bass), and Paul Granger (percussion). Johnson, Granger, and vocalist Mick Dewhirst played with Knopfler in a band called Silverheels.\nUpon graduation in 1973, Knopfler moved to London and joined a High Wycombe-based band called Brewers Droop, appearing on the album The Booze Brothers. One night while spending some time with friends, the only guitar available was an old acoustic with a badly warped neck that had been strung with extra-light strings to make it playable. Even so, he found it impossible to play unless he finger-picked it. He said in a later interview, &quot;That was where I found my 'voice' on guitar.&quot; After a brief stint with Brewers Droop, Knopfler took a job as a lecturer at Loughton College in EssexÃ¢â‚¬â€a position he held for three years. Throughout this time, he continued performing with local pub bands, including the CafÃƒÂ© Racers.[14] He also formed a duo with long-time associate bluesman Steve Phillips called The Duolian String Pickers.\nBy the mid-1970s, Knopfler devoted much of his musical energies to his group, the CafÃƒÂ© Racers. His brother David moved to London, where he shared a flat with John Illsley; a guitarist who changed over to playing bass guitar. In April 1977, Mark gave up his flat in Buckhurst Hill and moved in with David and John. The three began playing music together, and soon Mark invited John to join the CafÃƒÂ© Racers.[15]\nDire Straits (1977Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1995)[edit source | editbeta]\n\nMain article: Dire Straits\nDire Straits' first demos were done in three sessions during 1977, with Pick Withers as drummer, David Knopfler as rhythm guitarist and John Illsley on bass guitar. On 27 July 1977 they recorded the now famous demo tapes of five songs: &quot;Wild West End&quot;, &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;, &quot;Down to the Waterline&quot;, &quot;Sacred Loving&quot; (a David Knopfler song) and &quot;Water of Love&quot;. In what was probably[by whom?] October they recorded &quot;Southbound Again&quot;, &quot;In The Gallery&quot; and &quot;Six Blade Knife&quot; for BBC Radio London and, finally, on 9 November demo tapes were made of &quot;Setting Me Up&quot;, &quot;Eastbound Train&quot; and &quot;Real Girl&quot;. Many of these songs reflected Mark's experiences in Newcastle, Leeds and London, and were to be featured on their first album, the self-titled Dire Straits which was released in the following year: &quot;Down To The Waterline&quot; recalled images of life in Newcastle; &quot;In The Gallery&quot; is a tribute to a Leeds sculptor/artist named Harry Phillips, (father of Steve Phillips); and &quot;Lions&quot;, &quot;Wild West End&quot; and &quot;Eastbound Train&quot; were all drawn from Mark's early days in the capital.\n\n\nMark Knopfler with Dire Straits, 1979\nInitially on its release, Dire Straits received little fanfare in the UK, but when &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot; was released as a single it became a chart hit in The Netherlands and album sales took off, first across Europe and then in the United States and Canada, and finally the UK. The group's second album, CommuniquÃƒÂ©, produced by Jerry Wexler and Barry Beckett, followed in 1979, reaching number one in France while the first album was still at number three.[citation needed]\nThere were frequent personnel changes within Dire Straits after the release of their third album Making Movies, with Mark Knopfler remaining a constant member. Released in 1980, Making Movies marked a move towards more complex arrangements and production which continued for the remainder of the group's career. The album included many of Mark Knopfler's most personal compositions, most notably &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;. Love over Gold followed in 1982 and included the UK No. 2 hit &quot;Private Investigations&quot;, &quot;Telegraph Road&quot;, &quot;Industrial Disease&quot; and &quot;It Never Rains&quot; as well as the title track to that album.\nWith Love Over Gold still in the albums charts, the band released a four-song EP titled ExtendedancEPlay in early 1983. Featuring the hit single &quot;Twisting By the Pool&quot;, this was the first output by the band that featured new drummer Terry Williams, (formerly of Rockpile), who had replaced Pick Withers in November 1982. A world tour followed later in 1983, and in March 1984 the double album Alchemy Live was released. Alchemy Live documented the recordings of two live shows in Hammersmith Odeon in London in July 1983, and reached number three in the UK Albums Chart.\nDuring 1983 and 1984 Knopfler was involved with other projects as well, including writing and producing the music score to the film Local Hero which was a large success,[16] and it was followed in 1984 by his scores for the films Cal and Comfort and Joy. Also during this time Knopfler produced Bob Dylan's Infidels album, as well as Knife by Aztec Camera. He also wrote the song &quot;Private Dancer&quot; for Tina Turner's comeback album of the same name.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c8474daf4014b753d330e4d63898ec19659946b","amp;dn":"Mark+Knopfler+-+A+Night+In+London%5B1996%5DDvdRip.Eng.h264.AC3-6.M8+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c8474daf4014b753d330e4d63898ec19659946b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,132,116,218,244,1,75,117,61,51,14,77,99,137,142,193,150,89,148,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
