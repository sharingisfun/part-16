This conference highlights the contributions of the PSE/CAPE community towards the sustainability of modern society.\r\n\r\nContributors from academia and industry establish the core products of PSE/CAPE, define the new and changing scope of our results, and future challenges. Plenary and keynote lectures discuss real-world challenges (globalization, energy, environment, and health) and contribute to discussions on the widening scope of PSE/CAPE versus the consolidation of the core topics of PSE/CAPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHighlights how the Process Systems Engineering/Computer-Aided Process Engineering community contributes to the sustainability of modern society\r\nPresents findings and discussions from both the 12th Process Systems Engineering (PSE) and 25th European Society of Computer-Aided Process Engineering (ESCAPE) Events\r\nEstablishes the core products of Process Systems Engineering/Computer Aided Process Engineering\r\nDefines the future challenges of the Process Systems Engineering/Computer Aided Process Engineering community","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8355929abffb3e1925b3a819ae2e4c995d03f8d","amp;dn":"12th+International+Symposium+on+Process+Systems+Engineering+and+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8355929abffb3e1925b3a819ae2e4c995d03f8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,53,89,41,171,255,179,225,146,91,58,129,154,226,228,201,149,208,63,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
