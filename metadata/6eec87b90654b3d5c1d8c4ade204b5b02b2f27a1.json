Filled with fun\r\n  combat and twisted fantasy tales, Overlord: Fellowship of Evil invites\r\n  players to dive into an Action RPG where it's good to be bad, but it's\r\n  GREAT to be evil. \r\n\r\n\r\n  Overlord is the only series that actively encourages players to have fun\r\n  being the embodiment of evil, destroying all that is good in a subversive,\r\n  comedic manner. Fellowship of Evil captures this essence and adds in\r\n  four-way, chaotic co-op play where gamers can even turn on each other. Evil\r\n  always finds a way...sometimes it just needs a bit of a nudge. \r\n\r\n\r\n  Key Features \r\n  * Series signature dark, mischievous humour Award-winning scriptwriter\r\n    Rhianna Pratchett returns with a twisted and hilarious tale of evil,\r\n    chaos, Minions and the burning desire to destroy all things good! \r\n  *  Develop your minions!
