Futures updates of this notification tool will (officialy) setup the connection rate to once every two weeks.\n\n\n######YOU SHOULD GET THIS IF U ARE USIN\\&amp;#039; A PIRATED OR CRACKED WIN XP!!!######\n\n\n\nnote:\nSome antivirus and antispyware programs flag RemoveWGA as being infected/malware, although the application is perfectly safe and does not pose a threat to your system. This is called a \\&amp;#039;false positive\\&amp;#039;. The term false positive is used when antivirus software wrongly classifies an innocuous ( inoffensive ) file as a virus. The incorrect detection may be due to heuristics or to an incorrect virus signature in a database.
