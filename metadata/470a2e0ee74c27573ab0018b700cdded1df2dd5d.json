Over one hundred case studies of contemporary buildings from countries across the globe including the UK, the US, France, Germany, Spain, Hong Kong and Australia are interspersed throughout the book. The author has visited and photographed each of these examples and analyzed them to show how structure plays a significant architectural role, as well as bearing loads. This is a highly illustrated sourcebook, providing a new insight into the role of structure, and discussing the point where the technical and the aesthetic meet to create the discipline of architecture.\n\n* Presents a comprehensive analysis of how building structure contributes to architecture\n* Connects architectural design ideas and structure in the context of contemporary architecture, materials and structure\n* Highly illustrated, providing a sourcebook of architectural and engineering design ideas","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:470a2e0ee74c27573ab0018b700cdded1df2dd5d","amp;dn":"Structure+as+Architecture+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"470a2e0ee74c27573ab0018b700cdded1df2dd5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,10,46,14,231,76,39,87,58,176,1,139,112,12,221,237,29,242,221,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
