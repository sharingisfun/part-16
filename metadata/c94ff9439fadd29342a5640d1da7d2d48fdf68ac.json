In 1997, Modest Mouse returned with The Lonesome Crowded West, which earned more positive press and was a considerable sales success by indie label standards, supported by extensive touring. As Modest Mouse's following grew, they were courted by major-label scouts, and they eventually signed with Epic Records, who released The Moon &amp; Antarctica in 2000. \n\n  The new lineup recorded 2004's Good News for People Who Love Bad News, which proved to be Modest Mouse's commercial breakthrough, rising to the top of the album charts, spawning the hit singles &quot;Float On&quot; and &quot;Ocean Breathes Salty,&quot; and selling over a million copies as the band began headlining arenas. By the end of 2004, Green returned to Modest Mouse, and in 2006, after Gallucci left the group, the band recruited Johnny Marr, legendary guitarist with the Smiths, to take his place for the recording of their next album. Marr not only appeared on 2007's We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank, he became a full member of Modest Mouse and toured with the group in support of the album, which debuted at number one on the Billboard album charts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c94ff9439fadd29342a5640d1da7d2d48fdf68ac","amp;dn":"Modest+Mouse+-+Discography+%281996-2007%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c94ff9439fadd29342a5640d1da7d2d48fdf68ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,79,249,67,159,173,210,147,66,165,100,13,29,167,210,212,143,223,104,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
