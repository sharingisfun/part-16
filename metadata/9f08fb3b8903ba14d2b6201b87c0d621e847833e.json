Singers and performers of her stature and popularity rarely maintain their power for as long as she was able to. Her streaks of number one singles in both Australia and the U.K. are nearly insurmountable. And yet, on the other hand, her inability to really crack open the American pop market over the course of her career is a story that is heard all too often from groups hailing from nations as pop powerful as Australia and the U.K. Eventually, with the hugely successful &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head,&quot; Kylie would rattle the American pop psyche, reminding the rather insular scene that the bubbly girl who had first made waves with the 1987 cover of &quot;The Loco Motion&quot; had developed into a stylish, experienced, and able pop performer with a clear agenda -- both musically and visually -- and the chops to match. To focus on Minogue's American problem would only be looking at a small fraction of the larger story. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.2 Hearts\n02.In My Arms\n03.Stars\n04.White Diamond\n05.The One\n06.I Believe In You\n07.Red Blooded Women\n08.Chocolate (Radio Edit)\n09.Slow\n10.Can't Get You Out Of My Head\n11.In Your Eyes\n12.Come Into My World (Radio Edit)\n13.Spinning Around\n14.Kids (Radio Edit)\n15.Breathe\n16.Where The Wild Roses Grow\n17.Confide In Me\n18.Give Me Just A Little More Time\n19.Tears On My Pillow\n20.Better The Devil You Know\n21.I Should Be So Lucky\n22.The Loco-Motion (7&quot; Mix)\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n\n01.Like A Drug\n02.Heart Beat Rock\n03.King Or Queen\n04.Speakerphone\n05.I Don't Know What It Is\n06.Sensitized\n07.Giving You Up\n08.Love At First Sight\n09.Please Stay\n10.On A Night Like This\n11.Did It Again\n12.Put Yourself In My Place\n13.Celebration\n14.Shocked\n15.What Do I Have To Do (7&quot; Mix)\n16.Step Back In Time\n17.Never Too Late\n18.Wouldn't Change A Thing\n19.Hand On Your Heart\n20.Especially For You.\n21.Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi\n22.Got To Be Certain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
