He's declared deadÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Left to himself, he completes his mission. When he ends by reaching the Atmosphere of Earth, the latter is desertedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ just as his ship when the rescue team finds it.[/SPOILER]\n\n[size=3][color=Gray][b]Screenplay[/b][/color][/size]\nInspired by a poetry book, [url=http://elcosmonauta.es/poetica.pdf]poetica para cosmonautas[/url] ([url=http://www.elcosmonauta.es/poetics.pdf]english translation[/url]), even more than it is inspired from space, the move deals with a love triangle between Stas an idealist and a dreamer, AndreÃƒÂ¯, his best friends, more pragmatic, determined to leave his print in history and Yulia, the wife of the latter.\n\nThe cosmonaut purports to be filmed poetry. You'll probably be disappointed if you want to witness yet again Bruce Willis saving the world (cf. IMDB grade). On the other hand, those who will keep their mind open to a dreamlike experience, will not waste their time watching the movie.\n\n[size=3][color=Gray][b]Business plan[/b][/color][/size]\nThe other originality of this movie is it [url=http://classic.thecosmonaut.org/#plan]economic model[/url]. With its [i]creative commons[/i] license and its crowdsourcing funding, this movie cannot be any further from the movie industry. After a few documentaries (steal this film ; good copy, bad copy ; TPB AFK, etc.), animation movies ([url=https://karagarga.net/details.php?id=104464]Sita sings the blues[/url]), it is, to my knowledge, the first feature film thus financed. Now, let's see what are the avatars that will follow this (and our role as audience in their emergence).\nMore info here in French:\n[b]The plan[/b]: From the official site [url]http://elcosmonauta.es/theplan3_esp.pdf[/url]\n\n[size=3][color=Gray][b]Links[/b][/color][/size]\n[url=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/][img]http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/3.0/88x31.png[/img][/url]\nbeing under by-nc-sa creative commons license, it is [b]LEGAL[/b] to broadcast, copy and subtitle this film.\n[b]Official site[/b]: [url]http://elcosmonauta.es[/url]\n\n[size=3][color=Gray][b]Screens[/b][/color][/size]\n[img]https://whatimg.com/i/xi4d5z.png[/img]\n[img]https://whatimg.com/i/zfwg9t.png[/img]\n[img]https://whatimg.com/i/vqjphy.png[/img]\n[img]https://whatimg.com/i/nj7sii.png[/img]\n[img]https://whatimg.com/i/fryooh.png[/img]\n[img]https://whatimg.com/i/ue1ftx.png[/img]\n[img]https://whatimg.com/i/qktadd.png[/img]\n[img]https://whatimg.com/i/7qxolb.png[/img]\n[img]https://whatimg.com/i/htt3qo.png[/img]\n[img]https://whatimg.com/i/a6epcy.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7c19c99401a615af4345c637b11662ad6600662","amp;dn":"The+Cosmonaut+%28El+Cosmonauta%29+720p+CC+by-nc-sa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7c19c99401a615af4345c637b11662ad6600662","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,193,156,153,64,26,97,90,244,52,92,99,123,17,102,42,214,96,6,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
