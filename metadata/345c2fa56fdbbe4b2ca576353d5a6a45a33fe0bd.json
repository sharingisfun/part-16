He argued that the Holy Prophet (sa) had \nbeen in doubt about his own Prophethood, that he did not show \nany miracles, and that he did not possess any knowledge of the \nunseen. Anjuman Himayat-e-Islam sent these questions to three \neminent Muslim scholars, including Hadrat Mirza Ghulam \nAhmad, the Promised Messiah and Mahdi as , for their answers. \n\nThis book is a translation of the answers written by the Promised \nMessiah as . The translation was first done by Qadi Muhammad \nAslam Sahib, of blessed memory, and was published in 1972.\n\n\nQUESTION - 1 \n\nAccording to Christian belief, Jesus' mission in this world \nwas to show his love for mankind and to sacrifice his life for \ntheir sake. Can the mission of the Founder of Islam be said \nto possess both these qualities, or can it be described in \nbetter terms than 'love' and 'sacrifice'? \n\nQUESTION -2 \n\nIf the aim of Islam is to guide mankind towards Tauhid, why \nin its early period did it wage Jihad against the Jews while \ntheir revealed books only teach the Unity of God; or why \nshould it now be considered essential for the Jews and those \nwho already believe in the Unity of God to become Muslims \nin order to attain salvation? \n\nQUESTION -3\n\nWhich verses of the Holy Quran specifically speak of man's \nlove for God, or of God's love for man, using the very word \n'love'? \n\nQUESTION -4\n\nJesus spoke of himself thus: 'Come unto me, all ye that \nlabour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest.' 'I am \nlight.' 'I am the way, the truth, and the life.' Did the Founder \nof Islam ever speak of himself in these terms?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn Overview of The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community:\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mta.tv/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mta.tv/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is a dynamic, fast growing international revival movement within Islam.
