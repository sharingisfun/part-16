This 2007 album was recorded in a week at Adam &quot;Red&quot; Lasus's legendary Fireproof studio in Red Hook, Brooklyn, and the album is an aural stand-in for the Brooklyn neighborhood: charming, low-key, semi-obscure, with a similar diamond : rough ratio.\n\nSpin (p.106) - 3.5 stars out of 5 -- &quot;Landes' voice is buttery and melodic....Her New York-by-way-of-Kentucky pluck is a refreshing antidote to schmaltzy neo-folk.&quot;\nUncut (p.86) - 4 stars out of 5 -- &quot;Landes propels the whole project skyward with a voice that encapsulates the best qualities of Laura Veirs and Cat Power. It's pretty much essential stuff.&quot;\nQ (Magazine) (p.96) - 4 stars out of 5 -- &quot;[U]nderstated and beautiful, her soft voice lilting over acoustic guitar, banjo and little else on warm-hearted ballads...&quot;\nPaste (magazine) (p.56) - &quot;Landes writes her best songs from the seat of the aimless dreamer and paints her surroundings with an inviting haze of solace.&quot;\nThe Word (magazine) (p.101) - &quot;It makes for a lovingly crafted, beautifully textured record that splices together folk, country and indie without contradiction. And there are plenty of surprises along the way...&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65523aee8129f2b1695d6dd8874a00fb291cf7a4","amp;dn":"Dawn+Landes+-+Fireproof","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65523aee8129f2b1695d6dd8874a00fb291cf7a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,82,58,238,129,41,242,177,105,93,109,216,135,74,0,251,41,28,247,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
