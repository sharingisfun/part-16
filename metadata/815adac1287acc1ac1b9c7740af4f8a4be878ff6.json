Also, there are no credits at \nthe end of the first half nor are there texted \ncredits/intro at the start fo the second half. \nWhich means 1 solid release as always.\n\nRules are unclear if a show such as this would\nbe 'reality' or 'competitive reality'. Due to\nthis being a literal race involving lots of\nrunning and high motion we went with \n'competitive'.\n\n22/Slower+\nEvolve... or die.\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:815adac1287acc1ac1b9c7740af4f8a4be878ff6","amp;dn":"The.Amazing.Race.S21E11E12.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION+%5BPublicHD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"815adac1287acc1ac1b9c7740af4f8a4be878ff6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,90,218,193,40,122,204,26,193,185,199,116,10,244,248,164,190,135,143,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
