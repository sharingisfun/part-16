Players  take      \n         charge of one of the many European powers aiming to      \n         conquer the New World. Starting from 16th  century,      \n         players can choose  from  many  different  nations,      \n         each  with   their   own   unique   strengths   and      \n         weaknesses. Founding new colonies and  then  making      \n         them  thrive  is  key  to  success.  In  order   to      \n         accomplish  this,  players  need  to   manage   and      \n         optimize  resources   and   production   in   their      \n         colonies, before transporting the  goods  to  other      \n         colonies or back to Europe. Rival powers and Native      \n         Americans  can  prove  to  be  allies  or  enemies,      \n         depending on the player decisions.  Hostile  fleets      \n         engage  each  other  in  highly  detailed  tactical      \n         level. Players  can  command  their  ships  in  RTS      \n         fashion or take direct control themselves.               \n                                                                  \n         The Gold Edition includes the main game with DLCs:       \n                                                                  \n         * Colonial Navy DLC                                      \n         * Pirate Treasure Chest DLC                              \n                                                                  \n   \n         1- Unpack, burn or mount                                 \n         2- Install the game                                      \n         3- Go To Hell!                                           \n                                                            ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52bb4fd3f862859f4925ef595c8ed554ca7bc3df","amp;dn":"Commander.Conquest.of.The.Americas.Gold.Edition-PROPHET","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52bb4fd3f862859f4925ef595c8ed554ca7bc3df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,187,79,211,248,98,133,159,73,37,239,89,92,142,213,84,202,123,195,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
