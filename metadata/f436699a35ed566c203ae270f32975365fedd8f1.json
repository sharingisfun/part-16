The quality of the recording and the quality of the instruments (they try to use instruments which sounds as they sounded in Bach's time) put them a step above the rest in my ears.\n\nHere it's just nice to see them play in a serene and beautifull setting.\n\nAltough the audio will not satisfy purists on the specs (my HDTV provider doesn't send losless audio), it's still MAK-quality and that's the most important to me.\n\nEnjoy anf fly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f436699a35ed566c203ae270f32975365fedd8f1","amp;dn":"Johan+Sebastian+Bach-Musica+Antiqua+K%C3%B6ln-Die+Kunst+der+F%C3%BCge-2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f436699a35ed566c203ae270f32975365fedd8f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,54,105,154,53,237,86,108,32,58,226,112,243,41,117,54,95,237,216,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
