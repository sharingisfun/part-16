A while ago somebody requested these, and I remember liking them quite a bit back in the day, so I've done what I can to find them already scanned. I've been looking for months and these three issues are all that has come up. I may just go ahead and start purchasing them, too, because I'd like to have them in the personal collection.

The series began as a horror anthology, but soon branched out into other genres as well. It was published by various imprints from 1988Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1995.\n\nTaboo most notably serialized Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's From Hell. It also featured work by Moebius, Chester Brown, Neil Gaiman, Dave Sim, Michael Zulli, and Charles Vess, as well as Moore &amp; Melinda Gebbie's Lost Girls.\n\nEach issue of Taboo was at least one hundred pages long, featuring many stories per issue. Bissette's own imprint Spiderbaby Grafix &amp; Publications published the first seven issues, as well as a &quot;Taboo Especial&quot; one-shot, from 1988 until 1992. Kitchen Sink Press put out two additional issues in 1995.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5efc93081e0519a66086000c521bc3dd04a8fd2","amp;dn":"Taboo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5efc93081e0519a66086000c521bc3dd04a8fd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,239,201,48,129,224,81,154,102,8,96,0,197,33,188,61,208,74,143,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
