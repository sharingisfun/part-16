Revealing a wholly formed musical vision in the process of being realized by its uniquely gifted writer, arranger, singer, player, producer, and recording/mix engineer.\n\nRather than try to guess where Michael was headed with these songs, we've chosen to present them here just as he left them; as works in progress. Taken as they are, they offer a rare glimpse at the inner journey of an extraordinarily gifted artist. If you hear rough edges, all the better. These are Michael's own hand-made recordings, unretouched.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll compositions by Michael Hedges.\n&quot;Torched&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:51\n&quot;Spring Buds&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20\n&quot;Fusion of the Five Elements&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59\n&quot;Promised Land&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52\n&quot;Phoenix Fire&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40\n&quot;Dream Beach&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51\n&quot;Arrowhead&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:17\n&quot;Shell Shock Venus&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n&quot;Ursa Major&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n&quot;Free Swinging Soul&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:19\n&quot;Rough Wind in Oklahoma&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18\n&quot;Sapphire&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:48\n&quot;Gospel of Mary/The Holy Flame&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:34\n&quot;Java Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44\n&quot;Free Swinging Soul&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:29\n\n\nMichael Hedges ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ acoustic guitars, bass, harp-guitar, synthesizers, alto flute, melodeon, percussion, and vocals\nMichael Manring ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ fretless bass\nDavid Crosby ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ backing vocals on &quot;Spring Buds&quot;\nGraham Nash ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ backing vocals on &quot;Spring Buds&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2134432fb9d1c247e03a41f0337f9a60468197c3","amp;dn":"Michael+Hedges+-+Torched+%5Bmp3%40v0%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2134432fb9d1c247e03a41f0337f9a60468197c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,52,67,47,185,209,194,71,224,58,65,240,51,127,154,96,70,129,151,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
