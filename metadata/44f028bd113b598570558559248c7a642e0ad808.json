Founded by Joseph &quot;DJ Run&quot; Simmons, Darryl &quot;D.M.C.&quot; McDaniels, and Jason &quot;Jam-Master Jay&quot; Mizell, the group is arguably the most important and influential act in the history of hip hop. They were the biggest act in hip-hop throughout the 1980s and are credited with breaking hip hop into mainstream music.[1][2] In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked them number 48 in their list of the greatest musical artists of all time.[2] In 2007, the trio was named Greatest Hip Hop Group of All Time by MTV.com [3] They were also named Greatest Hip Hop Artist of All Time by VH1.[4] They will be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 4, 2009, the second hip-hop group to be inducted. \n\n\n\nTougher Than Leather \n\n\nTougher Than Leather is a 1988 studio album for American rap group Run-D.M.C. and a follow-up to their hit Raising Hell. While the new record did not maintain the same popularity as its predecessor, it obtained platinum status and spawned the favorites &quot;Run's House&quot; and &quot;Mary, Mary&quot; (a cover of The Monkees' song). Tougher Than Leather was the group's fourth effort and blended in elements of not only rap but also rock n' roll and funk, making it their most varied effort to date alongside King of Rock. &quot;Papa Crazy&quot; is based on Papa Was a Rollin' Stone by the The Temptations.\n\nA film of the same name, starring the members of Run-D.M.C. and their producer, Rick Rubin, was also released in 1988.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Run's House&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49 \n2.\t&quot;Mary, Mary&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:12 \n3.\t&quot;They Call Us Run-D.M.C.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:56 \n4.\t&quot;Beats To The Rhyme&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:43 \no\tSamples: &quot;Nautilus&quot; by Bob James \n5.\t&quot;Radio Station&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:50 \n6.\t&quot;Papa Crazy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18 \n7.\t&quot;Tougher Than Leather&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20 \n8.\t&quot;I'm Not Going Out Like That&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20 \n9.\t&quot;How'd Ya Do It Dee&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20 \n10.\t&quot;Miss Elaine&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:05 \n11.\t&quot;Soul To Rock And Roll&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:17 \n12.\t&quot;Ragtime&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:42 \n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44f028bd113b598570558559248c7a642e0ad808","amp;dn":"Run+DMC+-+Tougher+Than+Leather+1988+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44f028bd113b598570558559248c7a642e0ad808","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,240,40,189,17,59,89,133,112,85,133,89,36,140,122,100,46,10,216,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
