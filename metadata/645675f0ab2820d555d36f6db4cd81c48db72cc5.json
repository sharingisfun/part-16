Or at least that's the way it was in the mid-1970s, when brave if reckless Captain Peter Quincy Taggart, lovely Lieutenant Tawny Madison, and inscrutable alien Dr. Lazarus were the leaders of an interstellar law enforcement team on the TV series of that name. Twenty years later, the show is still in reruns, and Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver), and Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman) prop up their sagging careers by making appearances at sci-fi conventions, where they grudgingly shake hands and give autographs for the show's socially inept following. However, it turns out that nerdy sci-fi fans aren't the only ones watching: somewhere in another solar system, a group of alien rebels living under a regime of violence and repression have picked up broadcasts of Galaxy Quest, and they aren't aware that it's fiction. They travel to Earth and encounter the Galaxy Quest cast, who figure that they're just another bunch of guys who like to dress funny. However, they soon realize that they're being hired not for another autograph-signing session but for a real-life outer space rescue mission. Galaxy Quest was directed by Dean Parisot, who had a background in TV directing before his theatrical debut with the dark comedy Home Fries. ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide\n\n\n\nTheatrical Feature Running Time: 102 mins \nComplete Cast:\nTim Allen - Jason Nesmith\nAlan Rickman - Alexander Dane\nSam Rockwell - Guy Fleegman\nEnrico Colantoni - Mathesar\nPatrick Breen - Quellek\nJed Rees - Teb\nJeffrey Howard - Kyle\nKevin McDonald - Announcer\nSigourney Weaver - Gwen DeMarco\nTony Shalhoub - Fred Kwan\nDaryl Mitchell - Tommy Webber\nRobin Sachs - Sarris\nMissi Pyle - Laliari\nJustin Long - Brandon\nKaitlin Cullum - Katelyn\n\n\nDirector(s):Dean Parisot\nWriter(s):Robert Gordon, Robert Gordon, David Howard\nProducer(s):Charles James Newirth, Mark Johnson\nTheatrical MPAA Rating: PG(Mild Violence, Sci-Fi Violence, Watch With Your Kids, Adult Situations, Adult Language)\nCategories:Comedy, Sci-Fi &amp; Fantasy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:645675f0ab2820d555d36f6db4cd81c48db72cc5","amp;dn":"Galaxy+Quest+-+1999","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"645675f0ab2820d555d36f6db4cd81c48db72cc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,86,117,240,171,40,32,213,85,211,111,109,180,205,129,196,141,183,44,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
