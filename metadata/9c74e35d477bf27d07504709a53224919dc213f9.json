PLEASE read the manual as the control of this train is quite complicated in auto/cruise mode.\nCan be used in your own scenarios, and is available in QuickDrive.\nDue to incompatibilies and complications arising from the upgrade of Train Simulator 2012 to Train Simulator 2013, scenarios are not provided with the download, but will become available on my scenarios page as I complete them.\nEnglish User's manual supplied as a PDF file. Please read it as there are many unique controls for this model.(The manual is available in Start-&gt;All Programs-&gt;ChrisTrains)\nFree updates for life (see this note about product update emails)\nEnjoy it. I try to be responsive to people's requests so if you think something isn't quite right, send me a bug report.\nMinimum requirements\n\nTrain Simulator 2014 (upgrade from TS2013 is free on Steam)\n'Expert' control mode (my add-ons typically do not work with 'simple' controls. Turn off simple controls.\nRecommended: TSX mode ON (for shadows, stencil labels in cabs, train lighting etc)\nProduct(s) will not work in Train Simulator 2012.\nProduct(s) might work in Train Simulator 2013 but headlights might be missing.\n\n(NOTE THIS IS A REUPLOAD FROM ANOTHER USER OF THIS SITE ALL CREDITS FOR HIM)\nEnjoy ppl and seed for other!!!!\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c74e35d477bf27d07504709a53224919dc213f9","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2014++ChrisTrains+NS+SGM+Sprinter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c74e35d477bf27d07504709a53224919dc213f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,116,227,93,71,123,242,125,7,80,71,9,165,50,36,145,157,194,19,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
