VBR - Highest quality\n\n \n\n\nPublished in 1889, this is a humorous account by Jerome K. Jerome of a boating holiday on the Thames between Kingston and Oxford.\n\nThe book was initially intended to be a serious travel guide, with accounts of local history along the route, but the humorous elements took over to the point where the serious and somewhat sentimental passages seem a distraction to the comic novel. \n\nOne of the most praised things about Three Men in a Boat is how undated it appears to modern readers. The jokes seem fresh and witty even today.\n\n\nThe three men are based on Jerome himself (the narrator J.) and two real-life friends, George Wingrave (who went on to become a senior manager in Barclays Bank) and Carl Hentschel (the founder of a London printing business, called Harris in the book), with whom he often took boating trips. The dog, Montmorency, is entirely fictional, but as Jerome remarked, &quot;had much of me in it.&quot; \n\nThe trip is a typical boating holiday of the time in a Thames camping skiff. This is just after commercial boat traffic on the Upper Thames had died out, replaced by the 1880s craze for boating as a leisure activity.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f625b4d9e55c85ad547d515c7ab5b93a457bab96","amp;dn":"Jerome+K.+Jerome+-+Three+Men+in+a+Boat+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f625b4d9e55c85ad547d515c7ab5b93a457bab96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,37,180,217,229,92,133,173,84,125,81,92,122,181,185,58,69,123,171,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
