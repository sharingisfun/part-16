Beginning in 1942, the series follows a regiment of black soldiers who are forced to act as test subjects in a program attempting to re-create the lost formula earlier used to turn Steve Rogers to Captain America. The experiments lead to mutation and death, until only one remains - Isaiah Bradley.\nEnjoy and seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03c7bae9a975634045aecce077f6adc61d997cdd","amp;dn":"Captain+America%3A+Truth+Red+White+%26amp%3B+Black","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03c7bae9a975634045aecce077f6adc61d997cdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,199,186,233,169,117,99,64,69,174,204,224,119,246,173,198,29,153,124,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
