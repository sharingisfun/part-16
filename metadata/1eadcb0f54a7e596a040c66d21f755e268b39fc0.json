First Burglar\n\nGeorge and Gwendolyn Kellerman, a couple from Twin Oaks, Ohio, takes an all expenses-paid trip to the &quot;Big Apple&quot;- New York City for George&amp;#039;s big meeting for a top business company. George has a special night planned for Gwen before the big meeting the next morning. It consist of a dinner-and-dessert for two, then dancing, and finally back to their luxurious hotel suite at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. It seems like the perfect getaway vacation...until it takes a turn for the worse. Bad things stars to arise: The plane is rerouted to Boston&amp;#039;s Logan International Airport; They hop on a cattle-style crowded train to Grand Central, with extreme shortage of food; Upon arrival, the entire New York City Transit Authority, the local cab company, and the Sanitation Dept. are on strike; A heavy thunderstorm drenches George and Gwen; The hotel gave away their room; George and Gwen get mugged twice and kidnapped (in a NYPD squad car). It&amp;#039;s then that George is not taking this lying down anymore and threatens to sue everybody that never gave them a chance. Someway, the &amp;#039;Big Apple Pie&amp;#039; can taste very sour for the &quot;Out-of-Towners.&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1eadcb0f54a7e596a040c66d21f755e268b39fc0","amp;dn":"The+Out+of+Towners+%281970%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1eadcb0f54a7e596a040c66d21f755e268b39fc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,173,203,15,84,167,229,150,160,64,198,109,33,247,85,226,104,179,159,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
