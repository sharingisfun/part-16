Unfortunately, her high hopes fade fast when she's assigned to the rewrite desk.\n\nSean Costigan is a demoted homicide detective on the commissioner's blacklist. The last thing he needs complicating his life is a perky debutante with delusions of becoming the next great American journalist. Too bad she happens to hold one of the keys to solving his latest case, the Central Park murder of a notorious gangster. The other key? Sean's childhood sweetheart, the victim's widow, who has gone missing.\n\nSean soon has more trouble with dames than any good man deserves. But that's the least of his worries. When he suspects deadly corruption within his own department, it's not just his and Trixie's careers that depend on finding the killer. It's their lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b82bafebe92afad5bcae18607b04ec9dbac6cab","amp;dn":"Delynn+Royer+-+It+Had+to+Be+You+%28retail%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b82bafebe92afad5bcae18607b04ec9dbac6cab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,130,186,254,190,146,175,173,91,202,225,134,7,176,78,201,219,172,108,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
