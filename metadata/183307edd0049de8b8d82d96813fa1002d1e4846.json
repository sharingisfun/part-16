Prompted by an anxious Major General Mattis, Ferrando orders Bravo to cross the Euphrates the next night, but they end up entering Nasiriyah by day, driving through the city with minimal gunfire, save for an AK-47 assault by Platoon 3 leader &quot;Captain America&quot; McGraw on an empty car. Heading north to Mesopotamia, Bravo continues to lag behind other companies, partly because of a wrong turn. Chomping at the bit while others are carrying the fight, the platoon finally gets &quot;lit up&quot; in a violent but successful skirmish in Al Gharraf, during which Trombley scores his first kill. Elated and relatively unscathed, the platoon celebrates its triumph.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:183307edd0049de8b8d82d96813fa1002d1e4846","amp;dn":"Generation+Kill+S01E02+The+Cradle+of+Civilization+HDTV+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"183307edd0049de8b8d82d96813fa1002d1e4846","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,51,7,237,208,4,157,232,184,216,45,150,129,63,161,0,45,30,72,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
