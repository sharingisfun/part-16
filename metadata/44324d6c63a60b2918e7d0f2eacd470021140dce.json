He is remembered for developing the theory of general semantics. Korzybski's work argued that human knowledge of the world is limited both by the human nervous system and by the structure of language.\nKorzybski thought that people do not have access to direct knowledge of reality; rather they have access to perceptions and to a set of beliefs which human society has confused with direct knowledge of reality. Korzybski is remembered as the author of the dictum: &quot;The map is not the territory&quot;.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44324d6c63a60b2918e7d0f2eacd470021140dce","amp;dn":"Alfred+Korzybski+-+Science+and+Sanity+%5B1995%5D%5BA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44324d6c63a60b2918e7d0f2eacd470021140dce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,50,77,108,99,166,11,41,24,231,208,242,234,205,71,0,33,20,13,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
