The novel shows Alexander from the perspective of the Persian eunuch Bagoas, named by historians as the Macedonian conqueror's lover. He is a youth robbed by betrayal and capture of his prospect for manhood, groomed because of his beauty for the bed of the Great King Darius. Once a slave regarded as no more than one of the Persian king's many exquisite possessions, Bagoas soon finds himself lover and beloved of the brilliant young man who has toppled his former master. Through his eyes, with their distinctly Persian bias, we follow Alexander as he leads his armies through a series of hard campaigns in Bactria and beyond to India. Beside him, Bagoas faces conspiracy, mutiny, and the dire hardship of a long desert march","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78250f4004c809991b50787285994c7c2c786c03","amp;dn":"The+Persian+Boy+-+Mary+Renault+-+LIBrArIUS+.epub+.mobi+.txt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78250f4004c809991b50787285994c7c2c786c03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,37,15,64,4,200,9,153,27,80,120,114,133,153,76,124,44,120,108,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
