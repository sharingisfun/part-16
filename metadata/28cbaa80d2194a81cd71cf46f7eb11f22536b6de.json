Please seed\n\n\n\nWikipedia:\n\n\nGandalf were an influential late 1960s psychedelic rock group.\nThey were an American band originally called the Rahgoos and formed by Peter Sando, Frank Hubach, Bob Muller and Davy Bauer.\nThey signed a record deal with Capitol Records in 1967 who made them rename the band Gandalf.\nThey recorded their first and only LP the same year. The record includes covers of Tim Hardin, Eden Ahbez and Bonner &amp; Gordon (the writers of &quot;Happy Together&quot;) and two songs composed by the band's guitarist Peter Sando.\nBut Capitol spurned them and only released the LP in 1969 with the wrong record inside the sleeve. The copies were recalled and damaged the band's career. Capitol didn't promote the record which made the sales worse.[citation needed]\nOver the years the album's reputation grew and it was re-released by Sundazed records in 2002.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n&quot;Golden Earrings&quot; (Ray Evans/Jay Livingston/Victor Young cover)\n&quot;Hang On To A Dream&quot; (Tim Hardin cover)\n&quot;Never Too Far&quot; (Hardin)\n&quot;Scarlet Ribbons&quot; (Evelyn Danzig/Jack Segal cover)\n&quot;You Upset The Grace Of Living&quot; (Hardin)\n&quot;Can You Travel In The Dark Alone&quot; (Peter Sando)\n&quot;Nature Boy&quot; (Eden Ahbez cover)\n&quot;Tiffany Rings&quot; (Garry Bonner/Alan Gordon cover)\n&quot;Me About You&quot; (Bonner/Gordon)\n&quot;I Watch The Moon&quot; (Sando)\n\nMy apologies for the original upload","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28cbaa80d2194a81cd71cf46f7eb11f22536b6de","amp;dn":"Gandalf+1969+%5Breupload%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28cbaa80d2194a81cd71cf46f7eb11f22536b6de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,203,170,128,210,25,74,129,205,113,207,70,247,235,17,242,37,54,182,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
