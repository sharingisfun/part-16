A good amount of warmth to the bass and durms and an over all clear fat sound. You can't go wrong with the songs on this disc. There are the classics: Another One Bites the Dust, Crazy Little Thing Called Love, Play the Game, Dragon Attack, Save Me and so on. The only dissapointing fact with this disc is the photo gallery.\n\nFor those of you that prefer stereo, there's an excellent 96KHz stereo track, although once you've heard the surround mix it's hard to imagine only using two speakers for this anymore. If you don't have a DVD Audio player, the stereo track should play on all DVD players, and there is also an excellent DTS 96/24 version of the DVD Audio mix in 5.1 surround. You will of course need a DTS capable system to hear it.\n\nPlease Seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60693d5e85bb68e4dbd408fa13b4e174de815755","amp;dn":"Queen+The+Game+Audio-DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60693d5e85bb68e4dbd408fa13b4e174de815755","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,105,61,94,133,187,104,228,219,212,8,250,19,180,225,116,222,129,87,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
