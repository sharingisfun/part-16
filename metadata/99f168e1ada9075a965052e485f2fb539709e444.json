The Cambridge Companion to Muhammad comprises a collection of essays by some of the most accomplished scholars in the field exploring the life and legacy of the Prophet.\n\nThe book is divided into three sections, the first charting his biography and the milieu into which he was born, the revelation of the Qur' n, and his role within the early Muslim community. The second part assesses his legacy as a law-maker, philosopher, and politician and, finally, in the third part, chapters examine how Muhammad has been remembered across history in biography, prose, poetry, and, most recently, in film andfiction. \n\nEssays are written to engage and inform students, teachers, and readers coming to the subject for the first time. They will come away with a deeper appreciation of the breadth of the Islamic tradition, of the centrality of the role of the Prophet in that tradition, and, indeed, of what it means to be a Muslim today.\n\nTitle: The Cambridge Companion to Muhammad (Cambridge Companions to Religion)\nAuthor(s): Edited by Jonathan E.
