Compatible with Flash versions including Flash CS3 (9.0). Supports both ActionScript 2.0 and 3.0. After the converting, you can get the completed FLA file including linkage, components, *.as, etc.\n\nWith SWF Decompiler for Mac, you can extract any element of the Flash movie such as shapes, morph shapes, images, sounds, videos, frames, fonts, texts, buttons, sprites and ActionScripts. E.g. you can extract ActionScript as *.as file, get sounds as mp3 or wav, images as jpeg, bmp or png, videos as flv, shapes as swf, etc. Both standard SWF and EXE (Flash project) files are supported.\n\n\n\n\n--\nSeems to work fine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05b683cc3a7c12e84c14590f290ccee85322ff4d","amp;dn":"Sothink+SWF+Decompiler+for+Mac+w%2F%5Bk%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05b683cc3a7c12e84c14590f290ccee85322ff4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,182,131,204,58,124,18,232,76,20,89,15,41,12,206,232,83,34,255,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
