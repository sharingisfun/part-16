These eight articles go beyond strictly mapping syntactic properties, touching on broader theoretical questions related to Chomsky's Minimalist Program in particular. The reputation of the contributors, combined with the collection of cutting-edge research in one place, will interest scholars and students of generative linguistics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:156e304a1dea3140d6afd0a5cd3968616d60b86d","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2004%5D+Structures+and+Beyond+The+Cartography+of+Syntactic+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"156e304a1dea3140d6afd0a5cd3968616d60b86d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,110,48,74,29,234,49,64,214,175,208,165,205,57,104,97,109,96,184,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
