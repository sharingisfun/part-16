Using her sharp tongue and agile mind, she navigates the stormy seas of friendship with high-born daughters and her roommate, a plain scholarship case. As Gemma discovers that her mother&amp;#039;s death may have an otherworldly cause, and that she herself may have innate powers, Gemma is forced to face her own frightening, yet exciting destiny . . . if only she can believe in it.\n\n\n\n~Rebel Angels\n\nAbout the Book:\n Ah, Christmas! Gemma Doyle is looking forward to a holiday from Spence Academy, spending time with her friends in the city, attending ritzy balls, and on a somber note, tending to her ailing father. As she prepares to ring in the New Year, 1896, a handsome young man, Lord Denby, has set his sights on Gemma, or so it seems. Yet amidst the distractions of London, GemmaÃƒÂ¢??s visions intensifyÃƒÂ¢??visions of three girls dressed in white, to whom something horrific has happened, something only the realms can explain. . . .\n\nThe lure is strong, and before long, Gemma, Felicity, and Ann are turning flowers into butterflies in the enchanted world of the realms that Gemma alone can bring them to. To the girlsÃƒÂ¢?? great joy, their beloved Pippa is there as well, eager to complete their circle of friendship.\n\nBut all is not well in the realmsÃƒÂ¢??or out. The mysterious Kartik has reappeared, telling Gemma she must find the Temple and bind the magic, else great disaster will befall her. GemmaÃƒÂ¢??s willing to do his intrusive bidding, despite the dangers it brings, for it means she will meet up with her motherÃƒÂ¢??s greatest friendÃƒÂ¢??and now her foe, Circe. Until Circe is destroyed, Gemma cannot live out her destiny. But finding Circe proves a most perilous task.\n\n\n\n~The Sweet Far Thing\n\nAbout the Book:\nIt has been a year of change since Gemma Doyle arrived at the foreboding Spence Academy. Her mother murdered, her father a\nlaudanum addict, Gemma has relied on an unsuspected strength and has discovered an ability to travel to an enchanted world called the realms, where dark magic runs wild. Despite certain peril, Gemma has bound the magic to herself and forged unlikely new alliances. Now, as Gemma approaches her London debut, the time has come to test these bonds.\n\nThe Order - the mysterious group her mother was once part of - is grappling for control of the realms, as is the Rakshana. Spence&amp;#039;s burned East Wing is being rebuilt, but why now? Gemma and her friends see Pippa, but she is not the same. And their friendship faces its gravest trial as Gemma must decide once and for all what role she is meant for.\n\n---------------------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.randomhouse.com/teens/greatbeauty/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.randomhouse.com/teens/greatbeauty/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0e711bc1632992df8577b0abae9084a192fc8c4","amp;dn":"Gemma+Doyle+Trilogy+by+Libba+Bray.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0e711bc1632992df8577b0abae9084a192fc8c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,231,17,188,22,50,153,45,248,87,123,10,186,233,8,74,25,47,200,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
