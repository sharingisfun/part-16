This is a much more manageable size. \n\nWhen word leaked that the final Twilight movie would be split into two parts, most people assumed that this was done by the studio as a cynical cash grab. Not so. The last chapter in the Twilight saga is so vast, so detailed, that it demanded the lush, panoramic two movie treatment.\n \nOkay, maybe they could have trimmed some of that twenty minute wedding because it was very straightforward and didn't impact the story in any way and essentially could have been a wedding from a Reese Witherspoon movie. And we probably didn't need every single one of the scenes where Jacob visits the Cullens' house and shouts at someone. And dear god, they are showing them playing chess on their honeymoon AGAIN!\n \nFortunately, the remaining twelve minutes of the movie that advances the &quot;plot&quot; in some fashion makes up for the slow pace of the rest of the movie by being disgusting and incoherent. The birth of Bella and Edward's horrible mutant spawn is repellent, nasty and vile, and yes, we are just referring to the decision to name it Renesmee.*\n \nAlso, this time the wolves go to a logging plant and communicate via telepathy.\n \nMike, Kevin and Bill love to hang out at the logging plant too, or at least they did until that lame foreman called their parents and ruined all their fun.\n \n*DO NOT NAME YOUR CHILD THIS OR ALLOW ANYONE YOU KNOW TO NAME THEIR CHILD THIS\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76f6b9528a674309bde61aa9326dbd52efdac32d","amp;dn":"Rifftrax+-+Twilight%3A+Breaking+Dawn+Part+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76f6b9528a674309bde61aa9326dbd52efdac32d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,246,185,82,138,103,67,9,189,230,26,169,50,109,189,82,239,218,195,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
