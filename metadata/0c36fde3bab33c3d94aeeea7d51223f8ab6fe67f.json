It was mixed by Stratovarius' Timo Tolkki, who also played additional lead guitar on &quot;Out Of Control&quot;, and featured additional lead and backing vocals by Hansi KÃƒÂ¼rsch of Blind Guardian on &quot;Out of Control&quot; and the title track &quot;Vain Glory Opera.&quot; \n\nFurther choir vocals were supplied by Ralf Zdiarstek and Norman Meiritz. At the time of recording the album, Edguy had not yet chosen a permanent drummer to succeed Dominik Storch. So session musician Frank Lindenthal, a good friend of the band, was asked to play drums on the album.\n\n&quot;Hymn&quot; is a cover version of the song from the album Quartet (1982) by the British New Wave band Ultravox.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \n\n    &quot;Overture&quot;            Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:31\n    &quot;Until We Rise Again&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:28\n    &quot;How Many Miles&quot;      Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:39\n    &quot;Scarlet Rose&quot;        Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:10\n    &quot;Out of Control&quot;      Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:04\n    &quot;Vain Glory Opera&quot;    Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:08\n    &quot;Fairytale&quot;           Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:11\n    &quot;Walk on Fighting&quot;    Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:46\n    &quot;Tomorrow&quot;            Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:53\n    &quot;No More Foolin'&quot;     Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:55\n    &quot;Hymn&quot;                Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:53 (Ultravox cover)\n    &quot;But Here I Am&quot;       - 4:33 (Japanese edition bonus track)\n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c36fde3bab33c3d94aeeea7d51223f8ab6fe67f","amp;dn":"Edguy+-+1998+-+Vain+Glory+Opera+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c36fde3bab33c3d94aeeea7d51223f8ab6fe67f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,54,253,227,186,179,60,61,148,174,238,167,213,18,35,248,171,111,230,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
