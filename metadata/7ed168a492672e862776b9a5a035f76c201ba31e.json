An audiovisual manifesto filmed over the course of 4 years and 4 continents, FIRST EARTH makes the case that earthen homes are the healthiest housing in the world; and that since it still takes a village to raise a healthy child, it is incumbent upon us to transform our suburban sprawl into eco-villages, a new North American dream.\n\nI will edit later with more info about the file.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ed168a492672e862776b9a5a035f76c201ba31e","amp;dn":"First+Earth%3A+Uncompromising+Ecological+Architecture+%282009%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ed168a492672e862776b9a5a035f76c201ba31e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,209,104,164,146,103,46,134,39,118,185,165,160,53,247,108,32,27,163,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
