Under divine orders, the headstrong warrior travels the world, slaying demons and vampires. When she stumbles upon a hidden stone fortress while searching for her clanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lost Book of Battles, dark forces swiftly imprison herÃ¢â‚¬â€and she discovers her cell mate is a gorgeous Scottish warrior who has no memories, but looks strikingly familiar.\n\nAnd only a secret from the past can win the dayÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and her heart.\n\nThe warriors of the centuries-old Connor Clan search for their missing time-vault and the powerful relic within. What they find is a graveÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and a kilt-clad body they fear is the long-lost Tavis Connor. But there may yet be more to the Highland warriorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fate than a pile of bones. Desperate to save his brother and his clanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Book of Battles from a demon hell-bent on destruction, Tavis begins a 150-year quest that will end in modern-day New York. But when he wakes, he discovers heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the one in need of help. His only hope of rescue is a bonny lass who claims to be a warrior. A warrior waging war on demonsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and his heart.\n\n\nNote: Converted the file with Calibre version 1.36.
