Sound theory is highlighted by rich and current practical examples. New chapter opening learning objectives and outcomes explore the critical concepts that will be discussed. New and revised examples and problems clearly show how the information is applied in the field. Expanded discussions are included on measurements, equipment, and basic metrology. The DFT concept presentation is now simplified. More pictures have also been added to make the material easier to learn. Mechanical engineers will then better understand the elements for the design of measurement systems and measurement test plans.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 590 pages\n    * Publisher: Wiley; 5 edition (November 16, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0470547413\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0470547410","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f826fac8cb1d9b2709556d0cfd736135f34e673d","amp;dn":"Theory+and+Design+for+Mechanical+Measurements+5th+Ed%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f826fac8cb1d9b2709556d0cfd736135f34e673d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,38,250,200,203,29,155,39,9,85,109,12,253,115,97,53,243,78,103,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
