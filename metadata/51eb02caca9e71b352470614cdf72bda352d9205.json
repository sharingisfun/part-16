The Hyperion label has oodles of very good CDs from this genre - if you like this one, perhaps you may care to explore their catalogue for further gems. (although the quality of the recordings is superb, I'm not too keen on the genre so I'll not be uploading any more from it).\n\nEAC FLAC + cover/md5/m3u\n\n____\n\nTreasury of English Song (Hyperion)\n\nVarious soloists and pianists - see %comment% tags of individual tracks.\n\n1.
