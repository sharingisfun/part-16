On board is a professor who daydreams a conversation with a love that never was, a family of Albanian refugees who switch trains and steal a ticket, three brash Scottish soccer fans en route to a match, and a complaining widow traveling to a memorial service for her late husband who&amp;#039;s accompanied by a community-service volunteer who&amp;#039;s assisting her. Interactions among these Europeans turn on class and nationalism, courtesy and rudeness, and opportunities for kindness.\n\nEnglish, Spanish and Portuguese (Brazilian) subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a3f45852d4eff462561bf4d2fa96135b0b8a57c","amp;dn":"Tickets+-+Olmi%2C+Kiarostami%2C+Loach+%28eng%2Cesp%2Cptbr%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a3f45852d4eff462561bf4d2fa96135b0b8a57c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,63,69,133,45,78,255,70,37,97,191,77,47,169,97,53,176,184,165,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
