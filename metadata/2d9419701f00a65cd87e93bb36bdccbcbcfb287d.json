While Babiuk has made a career out of this sort of thing with the Chesterfield Kings, the other Empty Hearts are used to paying homage to their roots in more roundabout ways, and on this album they seem to be having a blast making like the guys who first turned their heads around. The results are inarguably infectious Ã¢â‚¬â€ especially Ã¢â‚¬Å“Soul Deep,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which borrows from the Kinks and the Who at the same time, the Jimmy Page lifts in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Loud and Clear,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Perfect World,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which arguably does the Standells better than the Standells ever did (with Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders for a chaser). No one is reinventing the wheel on The Empty Hearts, and these guys are smart enough to know it Ã¢â‚¬â€ theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re just having a good time playing some tough, swaggering rock &amp; roll thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a lot of fun and a look back at their younger days as fans, and if you have any taste for this era of music, this will give you a big olÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ grin and make you wanna move, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing wrong with that.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d9419701f00a65cd87e93bb36bdccbcbcfb287d","amp;dn":"The+Empty+Hearts+-+The+Empty+Hearts+%282014%29+MP3%40320kbps+Beolab170","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d9419701f00a65cd87e93bb36bdccbcbcfb287d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,148,25,112,31,0,166,92,216,126,147,187,54,189,204,188,188,251,40,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
