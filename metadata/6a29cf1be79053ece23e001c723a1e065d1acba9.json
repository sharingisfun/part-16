With the author team of McGuire and Jakob, she is preparing Perspectives on Animal Behavior.\n \nBetty McGuire\nBetty received her B.S. in Biology from Pennsylvania State University, where she also played varsity basketball. She went on to receive an M.S. and Ph.D. in Zoology from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and then spent two years as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana. Her field and laboratory research emphasize the social behavior and reproduction of small mammals. She has published numerous research papers, co-authored the text Perspectives on Animal Behavior as well as several introductory biology study guides, and served as an Associate Editor for Mammalian Species, a publication of the American Society of Mammalogists. Betty taught Human Biology, Introductory Biology, Vertebrate Biology, and Animal Behavior at Smith College. She now teaches Mammalogy and The Vertebrates: Structure, Function, and Evolution at Cornell University.\n \nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 624 pages\n    * Publisher: Benjamin Cummings; 4 edition (January 16, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0321707028\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0321707024","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a29cf1be79053ece23e001c723a1e065d1acba9","amp;dn":"Biology+of+Humans%3AConcepts%2C+Applications+and+Issues%2C4th+Ed.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a29cf1be79053ece23e001c723a1e065d1acba9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,41,207,27,231,144,83,236,226,62,0,28,114,58,30,6,93,26,203,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
