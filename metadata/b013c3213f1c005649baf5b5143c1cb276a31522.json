Barnacle played all keyboards, tenor saxophone and electric saxophone, and Middleton did vocals and played guitar. &quot;Love Cascade&quot; and &quot;Cashflow&quot; are better known singles, but &quot;A Way You&amp;#039;ll Never Be&quot; featured two members of Level 42: Mark King on bass &amp; drums and Phil Gould on drums. Barnacle has returned the favor by contributing sax to a number of Level 42 songs over the years. The track was produced by the famous Martin Rushent (Human League, Joy Division, Rezillos, etc).\nKing&amp;#039;s fabulous slap bass line and Gould&amp;#039;s pulsing drums combined with Barnacle&amp;#039;s electronic sax give this track an early Level 42 vibe worth a listen. Long out-of-print and hard to find.&quot;\n \n\n&quot;...Leisure Process&amp;#039; sound was typically Rushent - tight, synthetic funk tracks with Ross&amp;#039; vocals delivered in a manic, new wave style. I dug the singles alot, and thought they had chart potential but of course they were largely ignored. I especially dig this 12&quot; version of A Way You&amp;#039;ll Never Be - it has such enormously pounding drums and some super poppin&amp;#039; bass, courtesy of Level 42&amp;#039;s Phil Gould and Mark King. You may not like what these guys did in their own band, but there&amp;#039;s no denying their musical skills. The tune also features a cool James Bond like xylophone riff that gets me every time, and since Gary is in the band it has a big sax solo. You can definitely hear a bit of the Human League&amp;#039;s synth action going on too, and that makes it doubly tasty to me. Nothing classic, but a fun little &amp;#039;80s obscurity nonetheless.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b013c3213f1c005649baf5b5143c1cb276a31522","amp;dn":"Leisure+Process+-+The+Singles+Collection+%5BRare+80s+Band%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b013c3213f1c005649baf5b5143c1cb276a31522","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,19,195,33,63,28,0,86,73,186,245,181,20,60,28,178,118,163,21,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
