Martin Belmont, Nick Garvey, Sean Tyla and Tim Roper formed the band in 1972 (see 1972 in music).\n\nDucks Deluxe remained a cult band throughout their career, with their first and best LP, Ducks Deluxe, achieving moderate commercial success only after the band broke up in 1975 (see 1975 in music) because the members had gone on to greater fame in Graham Parker &amp; the Rumour, Tyla Gang and the Motors.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:296abf8372f899a433981772c025dab943fe78d1","amp;dn":"1974+-+Ducks+Deluxe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"296abf8372f899a433981772c025dab943fe78d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,106,191,131,114,248,153,164,51,152,23,114,192,37,218,185,67,254,120,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
