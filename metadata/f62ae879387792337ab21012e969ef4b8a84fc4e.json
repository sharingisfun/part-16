Sharpe, Inc.\nAlan M. Glassman, Deone Zell, Shari Duron\n2005 \nENGLISH\nISBN: 0765612518 \n170 pages \nPDF \n4.97 MB\n\nAn emergent approach to organizational strategy making assumptions that few organizations actually realize the goal of deliberative, top-down strategic planning, and that effective strategy making occurs on a continual basis and is a shared activity of the entire organization. This innovative book provides the first in-depth look at how real organizations are formulating and implementing strategic change under this new paradigm. \n\nThe authors have dug deep into three large and varied organizations (Hewlett-Packard, the California State University system, and the County of Los Angeles) and identified each one's efforts to develop a new strategic planning process better-suited to match the current pace of change and environmental unpredictability. The book is filled with vignettes, quotes, and real-world examples that illustrate the trend toward faster, more adaptive strategic planning processes. It is relevant for a wide range of business, governmental, and non-profit settings, and should be required reading in any course on strategic planning.\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f62ae879387792337ab21012e969ef4b8a84fc4e","amp;dn":"Thinking+Strategically+In+Turbulent+Times%3A+An+Inside+View+Of+Str","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f62ae879387792337ab21012e969ef4b8a84fc4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,42,232,121,56,119,146,51,122,178,16,18,233,105,239,75,138,132,252,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
