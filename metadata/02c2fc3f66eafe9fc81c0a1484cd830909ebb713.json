This is a very nice Eagles bootleg.\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy, share with friends and seed please :)\r\n\r\nThe Eagles\r\nLos Angeles Forum \r\nInglewood, CA  (a suburb of Los Angeles)\r\nMar. 4 1980\r\n\r\nExcellent soundboard recording\r\n\r\nAnother stellar recording from &quot;The RS Arvhives&quot;\r\n(a Mexminute/TheCommish production)\r\n\r\n\r\nTheCommish notes:\r\nGreat show in support of &quot;The Long Run&quot; album.  My favourite Eagles era is the Joe Walsh period, so for me, this show is OUTSTANDING. It includes some nice horns work courtesy of David Sanborn, and the inclusion of Chuck Berry's &quot;Carol&quot; at the end is a bonus (but unfortunately, the song fades out a little past the one-minute mark ... bummer). A must-have show for any Eagles fan or sorta Eagles fan.\r\n\r\nSetlist:\r\n101. Hotel California\r\n102. Already Gone\r\n103. In The City\r\n104. King Of Hollywood \r\n105. The Sad Cafe **\r\n106. Lyin' Eyes  \r\n107. I Can't Tell You Why\r\n\r\n201. Those Shoes\r\n202. Heartache Tonight\r\n203. One Of These Nights\r\n204. Turn To Stone\r\n205. The Long Run **\r\n206. Life's Been Good\r\n207. Life In The Fast Lane\r\n208. Carol (incomplete--fades out)\r\n\r\n   ** with special guest David Sanborn\r\n\r\nLineage:\r\nSBD &gt; 2nd gen cassette &gt; CDR &gt; EAC &gt; WAV &gt; Editing (below) &gt; FLAC Frontend &gt; FLAC\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy these tasty gems!    \r\nMexminute (fellow DIME member).\r\n\r\nIf you decide to download this show, won't you please consider posting a comment on the show's board? It only takes a moment, and believe me, it takes A LOT longer to prepare/upload a show for others to enjoy than it does to download and run.\r\n\r\nAnd won't you please consider thanking Mexminute for sharing this mighty fine show with us?\r\n\r\nGenerously shared by Mexminute\r\nand uploaded on DIME by TheCommish\r\nNovember 2008","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02c2fc3f66eafe9fc81c0a1484cd830909ebb713","amp;dn":"The+Eagles+-+1980+03+04+Los+Angeles+Forum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02c2fc3f66eafe9fc81c0a1484cd830909ebb713","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,194,252,63,102,234,254,159,200,28,10,20,132,205,131,9,9,235,183,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
