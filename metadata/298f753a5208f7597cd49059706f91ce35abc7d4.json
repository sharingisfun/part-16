Many soldiers find it impossible to break out of this viceous cycle because of burnout due to constant stress, lack of sleep and peer pressure. Only after their 2-year (women) or 3-year (men) stints do many of them realize what harm the Israeli army does to the lives of millions - both on the Israeli and the Palestinian side - traumatizing them and perpetuating the hatred and mistrust. \n\n1 - IDF reserve duty (2007, &quot;The Alpha Diaries&quot;, 1h5m)\nShows some of the most common intrusions in the West Bank Palestinians have to put up with (sledgehammering or blowing up of doors, nightly raids of privates homes combing through whole streets or villages, curfews several weeks long, ...). \nBut some of the soldiers are aware that this constant pressure on the Palestinians and themselves is not a good idea. \n\n2 - Interviews with refuseniks (2006, &quot;Raised To Be Heroes&quot;, 53m)\nNew recruits and veteran officers talk about why they do not want to serve as long as the Israeli army is used by the politicians to administers a colonial regime in the West Bank by subjugating the Palestinians. \n\n3 - Female Israeli soldiers' traumatic experiences (2007, &quot;To See If I'm Smiling&quot;, 1h)\nFemale ex-soldiers tell their stories of bad or even traumatizing experiences they had during their two years of service in the Israeli army. \n\n4 - Confessions of an IDF assassin (2008, &quot;Z32&quot;, 1h19m)\nAn elite unit fighter tells shocking stories about what his superiors made him do. The culmination was the ordered assassination of arbitrarely selected Palestinian policemen in retaliation for the death of 6 Israeli soldiers murdered by an Islamist group. \n(NOTE: the first 31 minutes is the assassin talking to his girl-friend, the next 30 minutes to camera explaining his training and the details of the murder, after that the film director comments by singing)\n\n\nIf you want to see the view the Israeli army would like broadcast go to &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.soldiersspeakout.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.soldiersspeakout.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you want to hear more dissenting voices from within the Israeli army &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4279402/Israel-Palestine_-_Ending_the_hatred_and_violence&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4279402/Israel-Palestine_-_Ending_the_hatred_and_violence&lt;/a&gt;\nOR\nhttp://www.shovrimshtika.org/index_e.asp","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:298f753a5208f7597cd49059706f91ce35abc7d4","amp;dn":"Israel-Palestine+-+Israeli+soldiers+speaking+out","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"298f753a5208f7597cd49059706f91ce35abc7d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,143,117,58,82,8,247,89,124,212,144,89,112,111,145,206,53,171,199,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
