In 1988, however, he and wife Barbara Bach accepted that they both were suffering from alcoholism and took steps to rehabilitate themselves. Once Starr was sober, he felt the need to work again. Before delving into an album, he wanted to hit the road first - but with a difference. Always one to include friends, Starr concocted the All-Starr Band, an ever-changing live line-up of famous musicians that would back Starr up, in addition to each performing a song or two themselves.\n\nBooking himself on the road from July to September 1989, Starr was accompanied by Dr. John, Joe Walsh, Billy Preston, The Band&amp;#039;s Levon Helm, Garth Hudson and Rick Danko, Nils Lofgren, Clarence Clemons and renowned session drummer Jim Keltner. The shows were often sold out and were well-received, although Starr&amp;#039;s thunder was stolen by Paul McCartney&amp;#039;s concurrent first US tour in thirteen years for Flowers in the Dirt. However, demand was so high for Starr &amp; Co. that they would end up playing Japan before McCartney that same fall. After several years of laying fallow, Ringo Starr was doing what he loved best and was clearly all the happier for it. The performance contained here was effected on the closing night of the US tour at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles.\n\nRingo Starr and His All-Starr Band was released through EMI in the fall of 1990 (Starr&amp;#039;s first association with his first label since 1975). In the US however, Rykodisc assumed the distribution of the album. Failing to chart, the release would ultimately be deleted some years later.\n===================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de83a99e3674464d0e15743e7f9ec3cfcfabb86b","amp;dn":"Ringo+Starr+%26+His+All-Starr+Band","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de83a99e3674464d0e15743e7f9ec3cfcfabb86b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,131,169,158,54,116,70,77,14,21,116,62,127,158,195,207,207,171,184,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
