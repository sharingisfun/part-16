January 29, 1992) was a well-known American blues bassist, singer, songwriter, arranger and record producer. His songs, including &quot;Little Red Rooster&quot;, &quot;Hoochie Coochie Man&quot;, &quot;Evil&quot;, &quot;Spoonful&quot;, &quot;Back Door Man&quot;, &quot;I Just Want to Make Love to You&quot;, &quot;I Ain&amp;#039;t Superstitious&quot;, &quot;My Babe&quot;, &quot;Wang Dang Doodle&quot;, and &quot;Bring It on Home&quot;, written during the peak of Chess Records, 1950-1965, and performed by Muddy Waters, Howlin&amp;#039; Wolf, and Little Walter, influenced a worldwide generation of musicians. Next to Muddy Waters, he was the most influential person in shaping the post-World War II sound of the Chicago blues. He also was an important link between the blues and rock and roll, working with Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley in the late-1950s, and his songs were covered by some of the biggest bands of the 1960s and 1970s, including Cream, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, The Doors, The Allman Brothers Band, and the Grateful Dead.
