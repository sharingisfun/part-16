The secret lies in micronutrients, vitamins and minerals that are being stripped from your diet and depleted by your lifestyle. On the Caltons' six-year global research expedition they discovered that modern practices such as global food distribution, factory farming, and food processing are creating foods filled with Naked Calories--calories void of any real nutritional value. The dynamic authors break it down to a simple three-step plan and teach you how to source better foods, eliminate unhealthy habits, and make choosing the best supplement as easy as ABC. Naked Calories, this decade's Fast Food Nation, will help millions of people gain a new depth of understanding about how to maintain health in the 21st century.\nThe Caltons are among the world's leading experts on the topics of weight management, lifestyle medicine and micronutrient deficiency. In 2005, they set sail on a 100-country, 7-continent, 6- year global expedition, exploring the dietary and lifestyle habits of people around the world. Their research has led them to conclude that micronutrient deficiency is the most widespread and dangerous health condition of the 21st century. As a couple they bring amazing energy, personal experience, passion and knowledge to an important subject people are just beginning to buzz about--the overwhelming health benefits of a micronutrient sufficient lifestyle.\n\nAbout the Authors\nMira Calton, CN is a Licensed Certified Nutritionist, a Fellow of the American Association of Integrative Medicine, Diplomate of the College of Clinical Nutrition, a Certified Personal Fitness Chef and is Board Certified in Integrative Health.
