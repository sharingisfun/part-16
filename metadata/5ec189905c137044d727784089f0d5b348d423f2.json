But Frampton and Carly are highly advanced (if bumbling) extraterrestrials. And boy, do they have news.\n\nThe entire cosmos, they tell him, has been hopelessly hooked on humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music ever since Ã¢â‚¬Å“Year ZeroÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (1977 to us), when American pop songs first reached alien ears. This addiction has driven a vast intergalactic society to commit the biggest copyright violation since the Big Bang. The resulting fines and penalties have bankrupted the whole universe. We humans suddenly own everythingÃ¢â‚¬â€and the aliens are not amused.\n\nNick Carter has just been tapped to clean up this mess before things get ugly, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an unlikely galaxy-hopping hero: HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s scared of heights. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also about to be fired. And he happens to have the same name as a Backstreet Boy. But he does know a thing or two about copyright law. And heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s packing a couple of other pencil-pushing superpowers that could come in handy.\n\nSoon heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on the run from a sinister parrot and a highly combustible vacuum cleaner. With Carly and Frampton as his guides, Nick now has forty-eight hours to save humanity, while hopefully wowing the hot girl who lives down the hall from him.\n\n\nThis is my first upload (and if it goes well not my last) so let me know if there are any problems and I'll try to fix them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ec189905c137044d727784089f0d5b348d423f2","amp;dn":"Year+Zero+by+Rob+Reid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ec189905c137044d727784089f0d5b348d423f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,193,137,144,92,19,112,68,215,39,120,64,137,240,213,179,72,212,35,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
