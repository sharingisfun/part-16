SimulTrain : Example of a Project Management Simulator.\n\n\nA project is a finite endeavor (having specific start and completion dates) \nundertaken to create a unique product or service which brings about beneficial change or added value. \nThis finite characteristic of projects stands in sharp contrast to processes, or operations, \nwhich are permanent or semi-permanent functional work to repetitively produce the same product or service. \nIn practice, the management of these two systems is often found to be quite different, \nand as such requires the development of distinct technical skills \nand the adoption of separate management philosophy, which is the subject of this article.\n\n\nThe primary challenge of project management is to achieve all of the project goals and objectives \nwhile honoring the project constraints. Typical constraints are scope, time and budget. The secondaryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nand more ambitiousÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½challenge is to optimize the allocation and integration of inputs \nnecessary to meet pre-defined objectives. A project is a carefully defined set of activities that use \nresources (money, people, materials, energy, space, provisions, communication, motivation, etc.) \nto achieve the project goals and objectives.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFilename.....: Project Management\nTotal size:....: 54.1 mega byte\nFile Format..: PDF files\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLIST OF BOOKS:\n\n1.
