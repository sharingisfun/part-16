Trouble is\n&gt; Sara&amp;#039;s left him a &quot;Dear John&quot; letter and will be by soon for her\n&gt; suitcases; plus, thinking it&amp;#039;s a party, Tom&amp;#039;s friend Sal has invited\n&gt; five women who were at his bar to come too. First the men talk - about \n&gt; women, sex, love, and homophobia (Tom&amp;#039;s pals include a happily married guy,\n&gt; a gay man newly engaged, a metrosexual, and Sal, an inveterate player). Then\n&gt; the women arrive and argue in the loo about men and sex before joining the boys \n&gt; for talk, alcohol, and hookups.
