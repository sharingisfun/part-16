It satirized television and the counterculture of the early 1970s. The film was originally produced to be shown at the Channel One Theater on 62 East 4th Street in New York, a venue that featured R-rated video recordings shown on three television sets, which was a novelty to the audiences of the mid 1970&amp;#039;s. The film starred Richard Belzer and Chevy Chase, and featured Move On Up by Curtis Mayfield in the film&amp;#039;s opening scene. The news desk satire, including the signature line &quot;Good night, and have a pleasant tomorrow&quot; was later used by Chevy Chase for his signature Weekend Update piece on Saturday Night Live, although in the film he does not appear in this segment.\n\nAmong the skits were The Dealers, a feature about a pair of urban drug dealers introduced by a wildly overdone, hip title segment, Koko the Clown featuring a jaded clown reading erotica to the kids, a public service announcement for venereal disease that covertly used a real penis, and a television cooking show featuring incompetent recipes.\n\nSeveral spoof TV commercials are featured, including a few for the mythical industrial conglomerate Uranus Corporation (pronounced &quot;ur-AY-nuss&quot; in the film). One Uranus commercial touts the amazing properties of its space-age polymer product &quot;Brown 25&quot; (which looks suspiciously like human feces): &quot;It has the strength of steel, the flexibility of rubber, and the nutritional value of beef stew.&quot;\n\nBuzzy Linhart appears in the film as an (eventually) naked hitchiker. He also supervised the film&amp;#039;s soundtrack.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5078c099ac239997227a43368abdb11beca3e49","amp;dn":"The+Groove+Tube+%281974%29.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5078c099ac239997227a43368abdb11beca3e49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,7,140,9,154,194,57,153,114,39,164,51,104,171,219,17,190,202,62,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
