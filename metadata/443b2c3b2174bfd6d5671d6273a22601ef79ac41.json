Cosy Dens, takes place in the Prague suburbs over the period of time leading to the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia on 21 August 1968. The setting is ideal for a political drama, but Czech artists prefer to make a comedy with political background.  The story is told in such a warm, witty and funny way that it reminds us of the golden years of Czech movie making in the 1960s and early 1970s. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i250.photobucket.com/albums/gg241/awrightus/pelisky/peliskyCover.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i250.photobucket.com/albums/gg241/awrightus/pelisky/peliskyCover.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe story is centered in an apartment building in a Prague suburb where two families from different political camps live together. While the adults live in their world, their teenage kids fall in love, listen to Beatles, and do other things their parents don't understand or approve. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i250.photobucket.com/albums/gg241/awrightus/pelisky/pelisky04.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i250.photobucket.com/albums/gg241/awrightus/pelisky/pelisky04.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFunny and tragic at the same time, this film was an instant hit with domestic audiences.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i250.photobucket.com/albums/gg241/awrightus/pelisky/pelisky06.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i250.photobucket.com/albums/gg241/awrightus/pelisky/pelisky06.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nA deep human drama told through comedy, it captures the parallel realities of the three generations living side by side. In a gently comic and bittersweet manner, the story follows the families and their relationships as they struggle through events from the mundane to the tragic. As they go through personal loss, the life still manages to go on has been captured with deceptive ease.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i250.photobucket.com/albums/gg241/awrightus/pelisky/pelisky03.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i250.photobucket.com/albums/gg241/awrightus/pelisky/pelisky03.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIt is a beautifully understated story of ordinary people living their everyday lives.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i250.photobucket.com/albums/gg241/awrightus/pelisky/pelisky07.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i250.photobucket.com/albums/gg241/awrightus/pelisky/pelisky07.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOne of the most moving scenes of the movie shows the father playing the Czech anathem on the piano. In the background, the radio announces that the Soviet Army has just invaded Czechoslovakia. The father asks his daughter how to say &quot;assholes&quot; in Russian. As he is standing on the balcony, yelling at the Russians, you can hear the rumbling of Russian tanks in the distance.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i250.photobucket.com/albums/gg241/awrightus/pelisky/pelisky05.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i250.photobucket.com/albums/gg241/awrightus/pelisky/pelisky05.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n~~~~~~ Pelisky.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,463,500,800                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:55:57                \nFrame Count:....................................173922             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................720                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................480                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.500                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1533                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.177&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................136                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............VBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2           \n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
