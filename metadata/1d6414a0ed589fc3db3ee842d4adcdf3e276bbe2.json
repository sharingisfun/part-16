On Ã¢â‚¬ËœBloodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ there is something mildly euphoric about the many-layered headrush of sound and the driving rhythms pushing the song forward. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s highly crafted, intelligent music with an electronic gloss; music that both hangs in and illuminates the darkness like the northern lights.  Waking Lines is a million miles from meatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢potatoes indie rock, but despite its moments of shimmering beauty and its attempts to reach for something extraordinary, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a record that ultimately disappoints. It feels insubstantial, and at times impactless; by the end the flood has become a trickle, the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grip on your soul loosens and falls away, and the sameness of one track following another leads the album into a musical cul-de-sac.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d6414a0ed589fc3db3ee842d4adcdf3e276bbe2","amp;dn":"Patterns+-+Waking+Lines+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d6414a0ed589fc3db3ee842d4adcdf3e276bbe2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,100,20,160,237,88,159,195,219,62,232,66,212,173,205,243,226,118,187,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
