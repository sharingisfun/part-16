Each volume features one or two sides of instrumental music from a different Soviet Socialist Republic. The recordings feature performances by both amateurs and professionals, mostly instrumental but with some vocal tracks. \n\nThe recordings are in most cases of the highest quality: rich, detailed, clean, with nice tonal balance. The LP pressings are quite good, with minimal pressing noise and essentially no tracking distortion. Each LP includes a booklet with brief descriptions of each track, descriptions of the instruments, and pictures of some of the instruments. \n\nVolume 4 has instrumental music from Georgia on side A and instrumental music from Armenia on side B. While there are a number of excellent performances on this LP, the highlights for me are three tracks featuring the duduk (A09, A10, B07), which I'm inclined to agree is, &quot;perhaps the most beautiful of wind instruments.&quot; \n\nMy LP copy is in excellent condition. It was transcribed to tagged 24-bit, 44.1 kHz FLAC files, using an analog rig that is near state-of-the-art. I used the mildest possible de-clicking but otherwise no noise reduction. The torrent includes a PDF file with scans of the notes in English and pictures of instruments in the booklet. \n\nI own 7 of 10 volumes of this set and will be transcribing others in the coming weeks. \n\nEquipment used for A/D conversion: Linn Akiva phono cartridge, Linn LP12/Lingo turntable, Linn Ekos SE tonearm, Audioquest LeoPard tonearm cable, PS Audio PS2 preamplifier, Kimber PBJ interconnect, M-Audio Audiophile USB A/D converter.\n\nGeorgian Instrumental Music\n\n01 - Zorka.flac\n02 - Georgian rhythm.flac\n03 - Presence.flac\n04 - Kartouli.flac\n05 - Mtsem Suri.flac\n06 - Pastorale.flac\n07 - Song of Jana Achba.flac\n08 - Sachidao.flac\n09 - Mukhambazi.flac\n10 - Mituluri.flac\n\nArmenian Instrumental Music\n\n01 - The Shepherd's Call.flac\n02 - The Funambulist's Dance.flac\n03 - Tsitsernak.flac\n04 - In the Moonlight.flac\n05 - Skipping.flac\n06 - You are a Bouquet of Flowers.flac\n07 - From First Light.flac\n08 - Chalakho.flac\n\nNOTE: To the best of my knowledge, these recordings are not currently available commercially.
