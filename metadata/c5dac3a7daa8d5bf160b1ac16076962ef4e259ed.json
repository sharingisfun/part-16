The Balkans has become synonymous with chaos and extremism. Balkanization, meaning conflict arising from the fragmentation of political power, is a condition feared across the globe. This new text assesses the key issues of Balkan politics, showing how the development of exclusive nationalism has prevented the regionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s human and material resources from being harnessed in a constructive way.\n\nIt argues that the proximity of the Balkans to the great powers is the main reason for instability and decline. Britain, Russia, Austria-Hungary, France and finally the USA had conflicting ambitions and interests in the region. Russia had imperial designs before and after the 1917 Revolution. The Western powers sometimes tolerated these or encouraged undemocratic local forces to exercise control in order to block further Soviet expansion.\n\nLeading authority Tom Gallagher examines the origins of these Western prejudices towards the Balkans, tracing the damaging effects of policies based on Western lethargy and cynicism, and reassesses the negative image of the region, its citizens, their leadership skills and their potential to overcome crucial problems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5dac3a7daa8d5bf160b1ac16076962ef4e259ed","amp;dn":"Outcast+Europe%3A+The+Balkans%2C+1789-1989%3A+From+the+Ottomans+to+Mil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5dac3a7daa8d5bf160b1ac16076962ef4e259ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,218,195,167,218,168,213,191,22,11,26,193,96,118,150,46,244,226,89,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
