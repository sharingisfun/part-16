The word\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“buildÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is meant to cover a boat you totally or partially build yourself or have\ntotally or partially professionally built by others.\nMy own exposure to custom boatbuilding began in the early 1960s when,\nafter purchasing a boatyard as an investment. I decided through choice and\ncircumstances, to take a more ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“hands onÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ approach to protect my\ninvestment.The latter involved serving a five year informal apprentership (after\nall I was the boss) under three great boatbuilders: George Love, a wonderful\nold time boatbuilder, Barry Long, who had served a long apprentership &amp; had\nconsiderable experience in all aspects of his craft, and finally Len Freestone,\na pioneering fibreglass boatbuilder who had immigrated from the UK to\nAustralia and brought his considerable skills with him.\nMy next step was to enroll on the US-based Westlawn Yacht Design course.\nAs with many things in life, my decision to study further was caused by a trick\nof fate when a so-called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“expertÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ we hired to design a boat for our yard made\na mess of the job, so I decided some in-house expertise was needed.Thus\nbegan my yacht design career over all those years ago.\nExperience in plywood and timber boat construction using the cold moulding\ntechnique was soon followed by the introduction of fibreglass boatbuilding\nmethods. During the early 1970s when the oil crisis at the time made the\nsupply of fibreglass resins doubtful at best,\nI explored steel construction methods by visiting Holland and spending\nconsiderable time in the local boatyards. Fortunately the Dutch are very\nforthcoming when it comes to sharing their knowledge and I was able to\nquickly grasp the finer points of this boatbuilding technique. Now, over 30\nodd years and 35,000 boats later, I am pleased to share my boatbuilding\nknowledge with you.\nBruce Roberts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa71fcea813d016b30a93c6e110ccbddccdbe905","amp;dn":"Build+Your+Own+Sailboat%5BBBS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa71fcea813d016b30a93c6e110ccbddccdbe905","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,113,252,234,129,61,1,107,48,169,60,110,17,12,203,221,204,219,233,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
