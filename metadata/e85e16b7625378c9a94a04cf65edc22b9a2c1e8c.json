He was a leading interpreter of religious experience who established paradigms in religious studies that remain important to this day.\n\nEliade is noted for his attempt to find broad, cross-cultural parallels and unities in religion, particularly in myths.  His theory that &quot;hierophanies&quot; (i.e., manifestations of the sacred in the world) form the basis of religion, splitting the human experience of reality into sacred and profane space and time, was particularly influential.  Eliade is most highly regarded for his writings on alchemy, shamanism, yoga and what he called the &quot;eternal return&quot; -- the belief that religious behavior and ritual not only commemorates, but also participates in, sacred events, and thus restores the mythical time of origins.\n\nIn addition to his work on religion and mystical experience, Eliade also expressed his views in literary works, notably the novels BENGAL NIGHTS (1933), THE FORBIDDEN FOREST (1955), and YOUTH WITHOUT YOUTH (1976).\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format, all of which are either new or reprocessed scans with contents in bookmarks and accurate pagination:\n\n* BENGAL NIGHTS: A Novel (University of Chicago Press, 1994).
