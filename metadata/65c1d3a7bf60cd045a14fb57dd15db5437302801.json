There is not enough room allowed on TPB to list tracks, so click the link below.\n\nSome of the artists include:\n\nBlossom Street Singers\nBlenheim Singers\nLondon Regency Choir\nThe Royal Philharmonic Orchestra\nSpiritual Choir\nAngelic Voices\nRegency College Choir\n\nYou get the idea. This basically covers all the Christmas bases for folks who are nuts enough to listen to this crap all December or who need soundtrack materials. It is pretty music, but people overdo it. There are no novelty or celebrity tracks here; these are professional classical groups performing in the classical style. Very Victorian Dickensian England.\n\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.play.com/Music/CD/4-/16586393/100-Essential-Carols-And-Hymns-For-Christmas/Product.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.play.com/Music/CD/4-/16586393/100-Essential-Carols-And-Hymns-For-Christmas/Product.html&lt;/a&gt;\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65c1d3a7bf60cd045a14fb57dd15db5437302801","amp;dn":"100+Essential+Carols+%26amp%3B+Hymns+For+Christmas+-+Various+Artists","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65c1d3a7bf60cd045a14fb57dd15db5437302801","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,193,211,167,191,96,205,4,90,20,251,87,221,21,219,84,55,48,40,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
