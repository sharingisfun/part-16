Led by uber-producer Peter Dragon (Jay Mohr), the series&amp;#039; first and only season ferociously lampoons the sleaziness of modern-day Hollywood. Dragon--seemingly the separated-at-birth brother of slimy uber-agent Bob Sugar (also played by Mohr) from Jerry Maguire--is a jerk who pretends to be gay when it&amp;#039;s convenient and doesn&amp;#039;t understand why Salma Hayek (playing herself) would slap him silly for making inappropriate suggestions during an earlier audition. In Dragon&amp;#039;s lair, sexual harassment is an inconvenience, the screenwriter is an afterthought, and a movie isn&amp;#039;t a film unless it&amp;#039;s got mega-explosions. Mohr and Illeana Douglas (portraying an ex-child star turned prostitute turned studio executive) are a joy to watch. When a sycophantic colleague accuses Dragon of promoting a hooker over him, he calmly says, &quot;She&amp;#039;s my prostitute. You&amp;#039;re my whore.&quot; A subtle difference, yes, but one that makes a world of difference in Hollywood. If there&amp;#039;s a plus side to this topnotch series being canceled in 1999, it&amp;#039;s that the writers didn&amp;#039;t have time to let the show disintegrate into hackneyed clichÃƒÂ©s. There is no warm-hearted parable to justify the nasty means--just a lot of quick-witted dialogue and an excellent ensemble cast that makes viewers enjoy the characters despite (or should that be because of?) their numerous flaws. --Jae-Ha Kim\n\nProduct Description\n\nWay too edgy for network TV, this funny, uncensored, naming-names series peels off the glitter of Hollywood moviemaking and exposes the duplicitous but totally addictive, behind-the-scenes truth. Campy, uncesored and very controversial, this &quot;too close to&quot; reality show features guest stars that include Keanu Reeves, Salma Hayek, Scott Wolf and Sandra Bullock. Superstar producer Peter Dragon (Jay Mohr, host of TV&amp;#039;s &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot;) builds his stellar career on the three pillars of show business - prostitution, nepotism and dishonesty. Adding to that an ego as big as a Beverly HIlls mansion, the aptly-named Dragon and his cohorts manage to be politically incorrect, back-stabbing, phony, petty, pissy and most of all - ingeniously funny! Action is the hilarious and outrageous Hollywood send-up from producer Joel Silver (The Matrix Trilogy and Lethal Weapon films).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3979456028237c8f11594b87f4f7948037515c42","amp;dn":"Action%21+Jay+Mohr+TV+Series+-+Comedy+DVD-rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3979456028237c8f11594b87f4f7948037515c42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,121,69,96,40,35,124,143,17,89,75,135,244,247,148,128,55,81,92,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
