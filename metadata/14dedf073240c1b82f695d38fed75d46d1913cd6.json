We began by collecting over 1,000 Fitness and Wellness questions asked by real students. Questions like, Ã¢â‚¬Å“How can I improve my self-esteem?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“Do I really need 8 glasses of water a day?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ introduce each section of material throughout the program. With its series of assignable videos that debunk common health and fitness myths (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sit Ups Make Your Stomach FlatterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“Marijuana gives you munchiesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), Questions and Answers: A Guide to Fitness and Wellness grabs hold of studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ attention and doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let go. The real-life behavior change case study videos found online provide students with unmatched relevance. Students click, watch, and learn as they follow real college students attempting to change their behavior for an entire semester, and hopefully for life. With its online fitness assessments, assignable interactive animations, and online labs, Questions and Answers: A Guide to Fitness and Wellness engages students like no other fitness and wellness program.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14dedf073240c1b82f695d38fed75d46d1913cd6","amp;dn":"Questions+and+Answers-+A+Guide+to+Fitness+and+Wellness%2C+2E+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14dedf073240c1b82f695d38fed75d46d1913cd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,222,223,7,50,64,193,184,47,105,93,56,254,215,93,70,209,145,60,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
