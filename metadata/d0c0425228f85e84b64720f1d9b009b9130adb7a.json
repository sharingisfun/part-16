From its \nloss in March 1968 until its exposure in March 1974, the world was \nunaware that the Russians had lost a strategic missile submarine with \nits three one megaton thermo-nuclear warheads, and two nuclear-\ntipped torpedoes.\n\nThe Soviet Government was equally unaware that the US had located \nand photographed the wreck and was preparing the largest marine \nsalvage operation in history to raise the K-129.\n\nProject AZORIAN, which was eventually known inaccurately to the \ngeneral public as Project Jennifer, was the CIAs audacious attempt \nto recover the K-129 wreck using a specially designed salvage vessel, \nnamed the Hughes Glomar Explorer.\n\nRepresenting the most modern missile-carrying submarine then in the \nSoviet inventory, the K-129 offered the US a cornucopia of unique \nintelligence targets, ranging from nuclear weapons to cryptographic \nsystems and other equipment. But retrieving it required $1.8 billion (in \ntodays dollars) and more than six years to design and build the \nequipment that could do the impossible.\n\nTo this day, Project AZORIAN is the deepest salvage operation ever \nattempted and was so far beyond the cutting-edge of 1970s \ntechnology that the Soviets considered it to be impossible.\n\nA brief flurry of press attention in 1975 resulted in a special \npresidential gag order being put in place by then President Gerald \nFord. This security provision has effectively blocked normal \ndeclassification systems and Freedom of Information Act requests to \nthis day.\n\nFinally, however, some mission members and senior engineers of \nProject AZORIAN have stepped out of the shadows to help tell this \ndramatic story in their own words. Utilising extensive, accurate CGI \nreconstruction of the salvage attempt, plus never before seen film of \nthe actual recovery itself, and based upon contemporaneous \ndocuments, AZORIAN: The Raising of K-129 provides the first factual \nand documented account of this unique event ever made available \noutside the confines of US Intelligence agencies.\n\n\nMore Info:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azorian\nhttp://www.projectjennifer.at/\n\n\n\n__ W4F is looking for __\n. 100mbit+ affil sites (archives a plus)\n.
