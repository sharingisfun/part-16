With their debut self-titled album, the Rockhampton pair won over the hearts of fans nationwide, fans who can once again expect to fall head over heels for the storytelling styles carrying through Farewell Fitzroy.\n\nThe first single from the album will come in the form of Get You Out Of Here which saw the band recording in NashvilleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s iconic Alex The Great studios with acclaimed producer Brad Jones (Missy Higgins, Josh Rouse, Justin Townes Earle). The track will give fans a soulful serving of what we can expect from the main course, which holds 11 new intricately crafted tales.\n\nThough their previous work may have been created solely as a two-piece, the lads are proudly announcing that Farewell Fitzroy sees them approach their sound with a full band. Says Jeremy Marou of the new direction:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“On the first album we were a duo but now weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a full band Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re hearing on this new record, the full band sound. We really wanted to capture our live feel.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:556f4a90f8abf336f7e5b4d163912d284546a1c2","amp;dn":"Busby+Marou+-+Farewell+Fitzroy+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"556f4a90f8abf336f7e5b4d163912d284546a1c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,111,74,144,248,171,243,54,247,229,180,209,99,145,45,40,69,70,161,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
