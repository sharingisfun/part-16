The recording was released in 1958, the year the first stereo LPs came on the market. Four years earlier, RCA, \nfollowed by other companies, released the first stereo recordings to the public in two-track open-reel tapeform. Bernstein's &quot;Le Sacre&quot; quickly became a demonstration item, due to its colorful orchestration and excellent \ndynamic range. The recording was issued in mono and in stereo on disc and open-reel track.\n\nStravinsky, who had been greatly upset by some performances of the piece, most notably Leopold Stokowski's version in &quot;Fantasia,&quot; was apparently taken with Bernstein's interpretation. He reportedly greeted the recording with the one-word reaction, &quot;Wow!&quot; \n\nThis is a transfer of the 1958 two-track factory pre-recorded open-reel - Columbia LMB24. It is a genuine rarity and is offered for its musical interest and interest as an early artifact of the stereo era.\n\nDate of Recording: 01/20/1958 \nVenue:  St. George Hotel, Brooklyn, New York \nLength: 34 Minutes 12 Secs.
