Unfortunately, The Sandman Presents: Marquee Moon, as the one-shot John Constantine and Mucous Membrane would have been called, has never been published, even a decade after it was first solicited.\n\nLove Street offered insight into John Constantine&amp;#039;s youth in the 1960s, setting the stage for the cynical magician he would one day become. Marquee Moon would have revisited Constantine&amp;#039;s early years, showcasing his brief fame as a punk rocker in the band Mucous Membrane. The future mage&amp;#039;s prominence in this story, however, would have been reduced, compared to his starring role in Love Street.\n\nMarquee Moon would have chronicled Constantine&amp;#039;s 1977 encounter with an American woman with a secret?the main character of the story and the mother of a young girl featured in The Sandman&amp;#039;s &quot;The Hunt&quot;-who&amp;#039;d moved to London and discovered punk-rock music for the first time. Had this 56-page one-shot seen publication, it would have featured The Clash&amp;#039;s comic-book debut.\n\nCollected from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.swampthingroots.com/marquee.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.swampthingroots.com/marquee.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dfc41655234d821b3ea942e6508ba1c8dc55ca7","amp;dn":"The+Sandman+Presents%3A+Marquee+Moon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dfc41655234d821b3ea942e6508ba1c8dc55ca7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,252,65,101,82,52,216,33,179,234,148,46,101,8,186,28,141,197,92,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
