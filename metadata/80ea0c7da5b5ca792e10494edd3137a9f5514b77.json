He died in 1963. His ashram is called Anandashram. It is one of the sweetest places on earth. It you are into the devotional mood, you don't want to miss this place. \n\nHe wrote many books. He is highly articulate, humorous, and very readable. It doesn't read like the usual &quot;swami-talk&quot;. My favorites are his spiritual autobiographies &quot;In Quest of God&quot; (included here, and &quot;In the Vision of God&quot;. \n\nThe ashram only makes a very small selection of his works available freely online. I offered to make ebooks and to put them online -- but they said there were difficulties with that. That really saddens me.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80ea0c7da5b5ca792e10494edd3137a9f5514b77","amp;dn":"Swami+Ram+Das+%285+books+plus+extra%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80ea0c7da5b5ca792e10494edd3137a9f5514b77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,234,12,125,165,181,202,121,46,16,73,78,221,49,55,169,245,81,75,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
