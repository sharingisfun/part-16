Starring Michael Horden as Jeeves and Richard Briars as Bertie Wooster.\n\nJeeves &amp; Wooster\n\nThe Jeeves and Wooster stories, narrated by the wealthy, scatterbrained Bertie Wooster, recount the improbable and unfortunate situations in which he and his friends find themselves and the manner in which his ingenious valet , Jeeves, is always able to extricate them. Collectively called &quot;the Jeeves stories&quot;, or &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot;, they are Wodehouse's most famous.\n\nThe Author\n\nSir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse, KBE (15 October 1881 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 14 February 1975) was a comic writer who enjoyed enormous popular success during a career of more than seventy years and continues to be widely read over 30 years after his death. Despite the political and social upheavals that occurred during his life, much of which was spent in France and the United States, Wodehouse's main canvas remained that of pre-war English upper-class society, reflecting his birth, education, and youthful writing career.\nAn acknowledged master of English prose, Wodehouse has been admired both by contemporaries such as Hilaire Belloc, Evelyn Waugh and Rudyard Kipling and by modern writers such as Douglas Adams, Salman Rushdie and Terry Pratchett. Sean O'Casey famously called him &quot;English literature's performing flea&quot;, a description that Wodehouse used as the title of a collection of his letters to a friend, Bill Townend.\nBest known today for the Jeeves and Blandings Castle novels and short stories, Wodehouse was also a talented playwright and lyricist who was part author and writer of fifteen plays and of 250 lyrics for some thirty musical comedies.\n\n\nFile Information:-\n\nFile Names: BBC Drama - Jeeves and The Feudal Spirit - n of 6 (Broadcast date) - Episode Name\nTotal File Size: 44,838,912 bytes\nDuration: 6 x 27 mins (approx )\n\nAudio Information:-\n\nAudio Codec: MPEG-1 layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kbps\nFrequency: 44100\nMode: Stereo\n\nEpisode 1 (79-05-21) - The New Moustache\nEpisode 2 (79-05-28) - Ephraim Gadsby, Gaolbird\nEpisode 3 (79-06-04) - The Dark Doings At Brinkley\nEpisode 4 (79-06-11) - Bedrooms, Burglaries And Broken Truths\nEpisode 5 (79-06-18) - A ManÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Best Friend Is His Cosh\nEpisode 6 (79-06-25) - Jeeves, Mastermind\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb1c1d0b5b6468109f2bb759480a5f2691af7288","amp;dn":"Jeeves+and+the+Feudal+Spirit+-+P+G+Wodehouse+%28BBC+1979%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb1c1d0b5b6468109f2bb759480a5f2691af7288","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,28,29,11,91,100,104,16,159,43,183,89,72,10,95,38,145,175,114,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
