This is practical, helpful, clear and concise, if you suspect sensory issues are a factor in your child's condition, I'd recommend a read.'- Aukids Magazine'Sensory Perceptual Issues in Autism and Asperger Syndrome enables teachers and other professionals, parents and people with autism themselves to fully comprehend sensory perceptual differences in autism.'- Adolescence'Bogdashina presents a very convincing argument that many of the behavioural patterns seen in people with Autism and Asperger Syndrome have a different sensory perceptual experience than people without these conditions. The experiences may involve hyper- or hyposensitivity, fluctuation between different &quot;volumes&quot; of perception or difficulty interpreting a sense. Any, and frequently several, sensory modalities are affected in an individual. This book is easily understood by both parents and professionals. It is well referenced. The Table of Contents and the Subject and Author Indexes are easy to use. This book may be a good place to start learning about the altered sensory experience of people with Autism or Asperger Syndrome.'- The Journal of the Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry'Examples of experiences from autistic people provide a useful insight into the range and variability of these experiences and a stark reminder of the pervasive nature of autism. As a clinician, this book has helped to reinforce the need to look at behaviours from an 'autistic perspective' and pick up on 'the clues' with reference to sensory perceptual difficulties and has been extremely valuable to me for my role within an autism diagnostic team. I would recommend this book to all occupational therapists working within the field of autism.'- Napot Journal'This is a great book. There are so many books on the market where experts presume to know better than autistic people themselves and disregard autistic peoples own accounts of what it feels like to be autistic, but this one breaks that mould. It is not only packed with factual information about how the brain and the senses work, it explores the autistic experience with an open and enquiring mind, while still tying all this in with conventional explanations of autism and results from existing studies. This book has a great potential to be useful, not just to parents and autistic people themselves who are looking for information and understanding, but to educators and service providers, whom it could inspire and advise. Interesting and accessible, I sat down today and read it the whole way through. Highly recommended.'- Asperger Information.net'It is refreshing to read a book that focuses on the wider aspects of autism rather than just the language, social and communication needs of the child/adult.' - Bulletin'This would be useful in a multidisciplinary team approach to autism spectrum disorder provision.'- Speech &amp; Language Therapy in Practice\n\nAbout the Author\nOlga Bogdashina PhD has worked extensively in the field of autism as a teacher, lecturer and researcher, with a particular interest in sensory-perceptual and communication problems in autism.
