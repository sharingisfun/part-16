After all, on one end of the lead rope is a horse that needs a chance to understand what is being asked and enough time to figure out the right answer. But on the other end of the lead rope is a twenty-first-century horse owner, often with a full calendar, a mobile phone, and always one eye on the clock. Day after day we promise to train ourselves and our horses to improve, but when we get to the barn, there never seems to be enough time. But as it turns out, what really matters is the quality of the training you do manage to fit in. It really is possible to carry out solid, progressive training with a horse in only three minutes a day! In this invaluable book, educator and horse trainer Vanessa Bee shares her own brief, digestible lessons that can ultimately produce significant gains in horse and human in very short sessions. 35 ground exercises, 25 ridden exercises, and 15 Ã¢â‚¬Å“real worldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ scenarios will help you and your horse succeed in no time!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s4.postimg.org/rcj4dh1st/3_Minute_Horsemanship.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s4.postimg.org/rcj4dh1st/3_Minute_Horsemanship.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e961241a02d1b1bc4d86a7654a553557c56849d6","amp;dn":"3-Minute+Horsemanship+-+60+Amazingly+Achievable+Lessons+%28gnv46%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e961241a02d1b1bc4d86a7654a553557c56849d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,97,36,26,2,209,177,188,77,134,167,101,74,85,53,87,197,104,73,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
