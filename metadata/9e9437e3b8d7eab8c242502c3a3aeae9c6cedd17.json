This terrific mini was written by Kieron Gillen and deals with the Sentient World Observation and Response Department, first seen in the pages of Astonishing X-Men. This was supposed to be an ongoing series but didn't sell too well; Still, what we got was a great expansion on the extraterrestrial counterterrorism team.
