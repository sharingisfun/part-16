THAT TORRENT WILL NO LONGER BE SEEDED.\n\n\n&quot;Every week we count down the most popular songs in the USA from Jacksons Gap, Alabama, to Jackson Junction, Iowa; from Jackson Hill, Indiana, to Jacksonville, Florida. Up 6 notches to number 30, here's Jermaine Jackson and, 'Let Me Tickle Your Fancy'.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown, the top twelve songs all hold the same position (not with each other, I meant the same position as last week). However, this did not break the record set on August 19th, 1978, when there were no movers in the top fourteen!\n\nCasey says one band in the countdown, Joan Jett &amp; The Blackhearts, will become the first major American rock band ever to play East Germany. This week they are at number 37 with, &quot;Do You Wanna Touch Me.&quot; (Should I have put a question mark there?)\n\nMichael Martin Murphy, who hasn't been on the chart since 1976, debuts at number 35 with his song, &quot;What's Forever For.&quot; (What is with all the inquisitive song titles?)\n\nThe oldest song in this countdown is a former number one hit, and two members of the band that recorded it only had to pass a &quot;one note&quot; audition. \n\nFor those who like their bands named after continents, Asia is at number 24 with, &quot;Only Time Will Tell&quot; bordered by America (at number 23 with &quot;You Can Do Magic&quot;).\n\nPaul McCartney's 76th top 40 hit, &quot;Take It Away,&quot; is at number ten, some new band called Men At Work ask, &quot;Who Can It Be Now&quot; (at number 18), and as if that wasn't enough, Casey plays the only top 40 hit (out of 36) by the Rolling Stones that wasn't sung by Mick Jagger.\n\nLW#3:  Abracadabra - The Steve Miller Band\nLW#2:  Hurts So Good - John Cougar\nLW#1:  Eye Of The Tiger - Survivor\n40:    Love Or Let Me Be Lonely - Paul Davis\n39:    Never Been In Love - Randy Meisner\n38:    Let Me Go - Ray Parker Jr.    \n37:    Do You Wanna Touch Me - Joan Jett &amp; The Blackhearts     \n36:    Someday, Somewhere - Marshall Crenshaw\n35:    What's Forever For - Michael Martin Murphy    \n34:    Hold On - Santana\n33:    I Keep Forgettin' - Michael McDonald\n32:    Don't You Want Me - The Human League\n31:    Tainted Love - Soft Cell\n30:    Let Me Tickle Your Fancy - Jermaine Jackson\n29:    Somebody's Baby - Jackson Browne    \n28:    Hot In the City - Billy Idol\n27:    Let It Whip - Dazz Band\n26:    Blue Eyes - Elton John\nLDD:   Lost In Love - Air Supply\n25:    Kids In America - Kim Wilde\n24:    Only Time Will Tell - Asia\n23:    You Can Do Magic - America\n22:    And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going - Jennifer Holliday\n21:    Out of Work - Gary U.S. Bonds\n20:    Rosanna - Toto\n19:    Only the Lonely - The Motels\n18:    Who Can It Be Now - Men At Work\n17:    Think I'm In Love - Eddie Money\n16:    American Music - The Pointer Sisters\n15:    Eye In The Sky - The Alan Parsons Project\n14:    Jack and Diane - John Cougar\n13:    Love Will Turn You Around - Kenny Rogers\n12:    Love Is In Control - Donna Summer\nEXTRA: Happy - The Rolling Stones\n11:    You Should Hear How She Talks About You - Melissa Manchester\n10:    Take It Away - Paul McCartney\n9:     Wasted On The Way - Crosby, Stills, and Nash\n8:     Vacation - The Go-Go's\nLDD:   Believe It Or Not - Joey Scarbury\n7:     Keep The Fire Burnin' - REO Speedwagon\nEXTRA: Proud Mary - Creedence Clearwater Revival\n6:     Even The Nights Are Better - Air Supply\n5:     Hard To Say I'm Sorry - Chicago\n4:     Hold Me - Fleetwood Mac\n3:     Abracadabra - The Steve Miller Band\n2:     Hurts So Good - John Cougar\n1:     Eye Of The Tiger - Survivor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6bc800d593caed2832c010c572ec1245c8376cb","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1982_August_28th_Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6bc800d593caed2832c010c572ec1245c8376cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,188,128,13,89,60,174,210,131,44,1,12,87,46,193,36,92,131,118,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
