As a youth Joplin was ridiculed by her fellow students due to her unconventional appearance and personal\nbeliefs. She later sang about her experience at school through her song &quot;Ego Rock.&quot; Early in her life, Joplin\ncultivated a rebellious and unconventional lifestyle, becoming a beatnik poet. She began her singing career as a folk\nand blues singer in San Francisco, playing clubs and bars with her guitar and auto-harp.\n\n\nBig Brother and the Holding Company: 1966Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1968\n\nIn 1966, Joplin's bluesy vocal style attracted the attention of the\npsychedelic rock band Big Brother and the Holding Company, a band\nthat had gained some renown among the nascent hippie community in\nHaight-Ashbury. She was recruited to join the group by Chet Helms, a\npromoter who had known her in Texas and who at the time was\nmanaging Big Brother. Helms brought her back to San Francisco and\nJoplin joined Big Brother on June 4,1966\n\ninfo\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pastebin.com/ag4BeNW2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pastebin.com/ag4BeNW2&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0668a99ee48e7629c0d2279e406f5b95692a3ed0","amp;dn":"Janis+Joplin+-+Box+Of+Pearls+%5B1999%5D+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D%28oan%29%26trade%3B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0668a99ee48e7629c0d2279e406f5b95692a3ed0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,104,169,158,228,142,118,41,192,210,39,158,64,111,91,149,105,42,62,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
