This feature uses the built-in\n  handwriting recognition in Windows 7.\n\n* Point-and-Click Editing with Automatic Formatting: Create\n  equations quickly by choosing templates from MathType's palettes and\n  typing into their empty slots. MathType applies mathematical spacing\n  rules automatically as you type.\n\n* Keyboard Shortcuts: Save time using keyboard shortcuts. MathType\n  has customizable keyboard shortcuts for virtually every symbol,\n  template, and command.\n\n* Type TeX or LaTeX: If you already know the TeX typesetting\n  language, you can enter equations directly into MathType or Microsoft\n  Word documents. TeX editing can be mixed with point-and-click editing\n  so you get the best of both worlds. You can even paste in equations\n  from existing TeX documents.\n\n* Copy-and-Paste: If you created your equation in another application or\n  found one on a website, why take the time to create it by hand again?\n  Simply copy-and-paste it directly into MathType, and it is ready to edit\n  or use in your work.\n\n* Save Expressions in the Toolbar: Drag frequently used equations and\n  expressions to the MathType toolbar so they can be inserted later with\n  just a click or a keystroke.\n\n* Microsoft Office 2007 &amp; 2010 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ MathType Ribbon Tab in Word\n  and PowerPoint: MathType takes full advantage of Office's Ribbon\n  User Interface making it easier than ever to do equation operations in\n  documents and presentations. New equation numbering and browse\n  features work with all Word equation types.\n\n* Microsoft Office 2003 and XP (2002) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ MathType Toolbar and\n  Menu in Word and PowerPoint: MathType adds a toolbar and menu\n  to Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, allowing quick access to its features\n  and powerful commands to do equation numbering, produce great\n -looking math web pages, presentations, and much more.\n\n* Find Symbols: MathType's Insert Symbol dialog allows you to\n  explore the available symbols and insert them with a click or keystroke.\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â \nMicrosoft Office 2007 &amp; 2010 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ MathType Ribbon Tab in Word and PowerPoint:\n\n\nMore Control:\n\n* Color: Use color to highlight part of an equation and focus your\n  audience's attention on just the portions you want. Show what changed\n  in each step of a multi-step procedure and make those equations really\n  come to life.\n\n* More Fonts: MathType has hundreds more symbols and templates\n  than Equation Editor. Besides our exclusive EuclidÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ math fonts, you\n  can also make use of the 1000s of math symbols in fonts already on\n  your computer, as well as other math fonts you can download from the\n  Internet.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nUB = PPC or Intel Mac, OS X.4.9 or later\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ce23af0793259f09c0be225b85aae0785a5498d","amp;dn":"MathType+v.+6.7c+with+Keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ce23af0793259f09c0be225b85aae0785a5498d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,226,58,240,121,50,89,240,156,11,226,37,184,90,174,7,133,165,73,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
