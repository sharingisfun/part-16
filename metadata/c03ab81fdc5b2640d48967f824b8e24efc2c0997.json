Arrogant and assured, Nathan is the star of the high school basketball team and hails from the wealthiest family in town. Quiet, brooding and driven, Lucas is a loner, the only child of a single working mom.\n\nHe&amp;#039;s always kept his distance from Nathan. But their lives collide when a twist of fate puts Lucas on Nathan&amp;#039;s team. The rumor that&amp;#039;s haunted the boys since childhood now becomes more than just whispers as the half-brothers compete not only for control of the court, but also for the heart of Nathan&amp;#039;s girlfriend.\n\nSo unfolds a deep and bitter conflict that&amp;#039;s been years in the making; one that will play itself out in their homes, their hearts and at school as they struggle to come to terms with who they really are - and the fact that they may have more in common than they ever imagined.\t\n\nATENTION:\n\nThis is the first DVD of the series:\nSecond you can find here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3611842/ONE_TREE_HILL_SEASON_1_DVD_2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3611842/ONE_TREE_HILL_SEASON_1_DVD_2&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAnd this user will continue uploading the serie.\n\nEnjoy and share\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c03ab81fdc5b2640d48967f824b8e24efc2c0997","amp;dn":"One+Tree+Hill+Season+1+DVD+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c03ab81fdc5b2640d48967f824b8e24efc2c0997","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,58,184,31,220,91,38,64,212,137,103,248,36,184,226,78,252,44,9,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
