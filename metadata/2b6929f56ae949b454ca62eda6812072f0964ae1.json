A book of the D'Artagnan Romances, it is a sequel to The Three Musketeers and precedes The Vicomte de Bragelonne (which includes the sub-plot, Man in the Iron Mask). The novel follows events in France during La Fronde, during the childhood reign of Louis XIV, and in England near the end of the English Civil War, leading up to the victory of Oliver Cromwell and the execution of King Charles I. Through the words of the main characters, particularly Athos, Dumas comes out on the side of the monarchy in general, or at least the text often praises the idea of benevolent royalty. His musketeers are valiant and just in their efforts to protect young Louis XIV and the doomed Charles I from their attackers. This book is the least well-known of the Musketeer saga but works effectively as a sequel, with reappearances by most main characters (or children of main characters) and a number of subplots. The d'Artagnan Romances are a set of three novels by Alexandre Dumas telling the story of the musketeer d'Artagnan from his humble beginnings in Gascony to his death as a marshal of France in the Siege of Maastricht in 1673. The three novels are: The Three Musketeers, set in 1625. Twenty Years After, set in 1648. And The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later, set between 1660 and 1673, this vast novel has been split into four volumes; The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later, Louise de la ValliÃƒÂ¨re and The Man in the Iron Mask.\n\nCover: http://i.imgur.com/vxwtXNM.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b6929f56ae949b454ca62eda6812072f0964ae1","amp;dn":"Alexandre+Dumas+-+Twenty+Years+After+%5BRetail%5D+%5BEPUB%5D+%5BMOBI%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b6929f56ae949b454ca62eda6812072f0964ae1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,105,41,245,106,233,73,180,84,202,98,237,166,129,32,114,240,150,74,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
