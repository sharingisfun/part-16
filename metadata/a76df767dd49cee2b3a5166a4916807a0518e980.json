Living areas \naccommodate the various alien species, providing differing atmospheres and gravities. Human visitors \nto the alien sectors are shown using breathing equipment and other measures to tolerate the conditions\n\nThe five seasons of the series each correspond to one fictional sequential year in the period 2258Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2262. \nEach season shares its name with an episode that is central to that season's plot. As the series starts, \nthe Babylon 5 station is welcoming ambassadors from various races in the galaxy. Earth has just barely \nsurvived an accidental war with the much more powerful Minbari, who, despite their superior technology, \nmysteriously surrendered at the brink of the destruction of the human race during the Battle of the Line.\n\n\nChristopher Franke Profile:\n\nBorn in Berlin, Germany, Christopher Franke studied classical music and composition at the Berlin Conservatory. \nBesides developing a love for classical music, Franke also experimented in eclectic music with the electronic/\nnew age band Tangerine Dream between 1970 and 1987. Tangerine Dream enjoyed a very successful run, releasing \nover 36 albums and several motion picture soundtrack recordings.\n\nAfter leaving Tangerine Dream in 1987 to explore new creative concepts and directions, Franke founded the \nBerlin Symphonic Orchestra in an effort to combine his signature &quot;musical expressions&quot; with an equal balance \nof orchestral, ethnic and electronic music. During this period, Franke released his first solo album, Pacific \nCoast Highway, followed by The London Concert in 1992. In 1994 he released Enchanting Nature, the positive \nresponse to that album paved the way for his biggest-selling solo effort to date, The Celestine Prophecy - \nA Musical Voyage which is considered by many to be one of the most creative new age albums ever produced. \nThis was followed by a unique collaboration, Transformation Of Mind, which paired several poetic readings \nby Deepak Chopra, along with nine delicate compositions by Franke.\n\nWhile being recognized as a major force in new age music, Franke has also garnered a tremendous amount of \nattention for several film and television scores including Babylon 5 and Tarzan And The Lost City. \n\n________________________________\n\n\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications:\n\nAudio File Formats: FLAC Lossless and MP3\nCodec Version [FLAC]: libFLAC 1.2.1\nCodec Version [MP3]: LAME 3.99r\nEncoding Compression Level [FLAC]: Level 8\nEncoding Bit Rate [MP3]: 320 kbps (Constant Bit Rate)\nNumber of Audio Channels [FLAC Lossless and MP3]: 2 (Stereo)\nAudio Quality [FLAC Lossless and MP3]: 16 bit / 44100 kHz\n\nAudio File ID Tags: VorbisComment\nIncluded Artwork: Scans (Plus Embedded Artwork Within FLAC Lossless/ MP3 Files)\nTag / Artwork Editor: Mp3tag v2.58\nAdditional Files: LOG, CUE Sheets, MD5, FFP, SFV, Foo dr and M3U\nTotal File Size: 1.52 GB\nEncoder and Ripper: BSW (and thanx to OAN)\n\n________________________________\n\n\nAlbum / Track Listings\n\n\nChristopher Franke - Babylon 5 OST [1995]\n\n01.\tChrysalis [Part 1] 03:57\n02.\tChrysalis [Part 2] 04:47\n03.\tChrysalis [Part 3] 05:50\n04.\tChrysalis [Part 4] 03:49\n05.\tMind War [Part 1] 03:39\n06.\tMind War [Part 2] 02:37\n07.\tParliament Of Dreams [Part 1] 06:14\n08.\tParliament Of Dreams [Part 2] 06:03\n09.\tParliament Of Dreams [Part 3] 05:45\n10.\tThe Geometry Of Shadows [Part 1] 07:46\n11.\tThe Geometry Of Shadows [Part 2] 03:29\n12.\tThe Geometry Of Shadows [Part 3] 04:05\n\n________________________________\n\n\nChristopher Franke - Babylon 5: Vol 2 OST [1997]\n\n01.\tMain Title 1st Season (Extended) 03:20\n02.\tMessages From Earth 10:07\n03.\tMain Title 2nd Season 01:32\n04.\tZ'ha'dum 12:21\n05.\tMain Title 3rd Season 01:33\n06.\tSevered Dreams 15:39\n07.\tMain Title 4th Season 01:31\n08.\tVoices Of Authority 11:32\n\n________________________________\n\n\nChristopher Franke - Babylon 5: Severed Dreams OST [1997]\n\n01.\tStatus Quo - First Engagement - Set Course For Babylon 5 - Main Title 04:32\n02.\tWe're in Trouble - The Arrival of The Alexander - The Speech - Major Ryan Arrives - Mars Attacks 04:45\n03.\tStation Intro - The Arrival of The Churchill - The Attack on ISN - Sheridan &amp; Hiroshi - The Flight 04:03\n04.\tMobilization - Delenn Breaks the Gray Council - Sheridan &amp; Father - Final Countdown - The Big Battle 17:22\n05.\tAftermath - What the Future May Hold - End Title 02:35\n\n________________________________\n\n\nChristopher Franke - Babylon 5: Shadow Dancing OST [1997]\n\n01.\tTowards Fate - Delenn at the Gray Council - Advance Scout Mission - Main Title 04:58\n02.\tMarcus &amp; Ivanova Depart - Garibaldi Worried - Franklin &amp; Child - Ivanova &amp; Minbari Rest - \n\tThree Nights Together - Franklin Attack 07:06\n03.\tFranklink Wounded - Shadow Scout Encounter - The Signal 04:44\n04.\tCountdown - The Grand Confrontation 07:23\n05.\tEmergency Treatment - What's Next? - Recovery - Dream Interpretation 04:50\n06.\tI'm Anna Sheridan - End Title 04:51\n\n________________________________\n\n\nChristopher Franke - Babylon 5: Z'Ha'Dum OST [1997]\n\n01.\tDestiny Awaits - Delenn At The Gray Council - Main Title 04:58\n02.\tG'Kar &amp; Ivanova - In Medlab - Sheridan Questions Delenn - Transitions In Space - I'll Go 05:43\n03.\tAnna Tells Her Story - Sheridan Gives In - Determined To Go 06:12\n04.\tTowards Z'Ha'Dum - Arrival On Z'Ha'Dum - Meeting The Enemy 07:40\n05.\tInto The Abyss 08:48\n06.\tEpilog - What The Future May Hold - End Title 03:03","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a76df767dd49cee2b3a5166a4916807a0518e980","amp;dn":"Christopher+Franke+-+Babylon+5+Soundtracks+Collection+%5BEAC-FLAC%2B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a76df767dd49cee2b3a5166a4916807a0518e980","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,109,247,103,221,73,206,226,179,165,22,106,73,22,128,122,5,24,233,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
