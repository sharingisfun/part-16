The 'look-alike' colour schemes are technically for a MaK 1206 locomotive. There are some big differences between the 6400 and the MaK 1206, but they look similar enough that these skins are a good substitute for a full custom 1206 locomotive.\nCab with two working driver positions (front and rear).\nIndependent wiper controls for front and rear.\nFlashing yard lights.\nParking / hand brake.\nUses smart scripting for cab lighting, custom controls and other functions.\nDynamic autonumbering with names (each of the 6400 locomotives had a name as well as a number)\nCan be used in your own scenarios.\nBasic user's manual supplied as a PDF file. (The manual is available in Start-&gt;All Programs-&gt;ChrisTrains)\nFree updates for life (see this note about product update emails)\nEnjoy it - let me know what you like and what you don't and tell me if you find something that needs fixing and I'll try to sort it out.\nMinimum requirements\n\nTrain Simulator 2014 (upgrade from TS2013 is free on Steam)\n'Expert' control mode (my add-ons typically do not work with 'simple' controls. Turn off simple controls.\nRecommended: TSX mode ON (for shadows, stencil labels in cabs, train lighting etc)\nProduct(s) will not work in Train Simulator 2012.\nProduct(s) might work in Train Simulator 2013 but headlights might be missing.\n\n\nEnjoy and seed people!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de6b9028388a9bab08a87abb808d9ccf0ff936cb","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2014++ChrisTrains+NS+6400","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de6b9028388a9bab08a87abb808d9ccf0ff936cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,107,144,40,56,138,155,171,8,168,122,187,128,141,156,207,15,249,54,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
