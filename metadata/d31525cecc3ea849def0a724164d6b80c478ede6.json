Home features two ragas, one of which is a creation of Ravi ShankarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, and with them Anoushka shares an intimate, heartfelt live performance in the traditional style.\n\nFour-time Grammy nominated Anoushka Shankar is one of todayÃ‚Â´s most distinguished and versatile classical cross-genre sitar performers and composers. Her unique approach to classical music and world music genres is both highly artistic and commercially appealing to a wide audience. After Traveller and Traces of You this pure Indian classical album is AnoushkaÃ‚Â´s third release on Deutsche Grammophon and 8th solo album recorded right at her HOME studio in London. Inspired by her classical upbringing and teaching by her legendary father, Maestro Ravi Shankar this album offers both meditative and virtuoso Indian classical raga for Solo Sitar with ensemble. With Home Anoushka continues her journey exploring modern and fresh ways to reinterpret and keep alive the beautiful musical traditions of India, as taught to her by her father Ravi Shankar.\n\n01 Alaap 11:08\nThe slow, rhythm-free and serene unfolding of the raga s character. Raga Jogeshwari is a creation of Ravi Shankars; however, this entire raga performance is an improvisation.\n02 Jod, Jhala 10:14\nA pulse and rhythm is introduced in the jod, gradually building up to a climax in the jhala.\n03 Gat in Rupaktaal 15:27\nThe tabla enters here, playing rupaktaal, a popular rhythmic cycle of seven beats. This gat is composed by Anoushka, and Tanmoy and Anoushka use the gat and rhythmic cycle as a framework for their improvisations.\n04 Aochar, Dadra, Teentaal, Coda 18:26\nAs is traditional, the final piece is played in a lighter, more romantic mood. After a short alaap known as aochar, Anoushka introduces a gat in ektaal of twelve beats, and then slowly accelerates the tempo to an intense climax during the second gat, played in teentaal of sixteen beats. An exciting tabla solo is featured near the end of teentaal, and, unusually, Anoushka adds a short coda at the end, again in ektaal.\n\nRavi Shankar once said: There is a saying in Sanskrit - Ranjayathi iti Ragah - which means, that which colors the mind is a raga. With Home Anoushka does just that.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.deutschegrammophon.com/en/cat/4794785&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.deutschegrammophon.com/en/cat/4794785&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
