It remains Nelson's most acclaimed album and features a lineup of notable musicians: Freddie Hubbard, Eric Dolphy (his second-to-last appearance on a Nelson album following a series of collaborations recorded for Prestige), Bill Evans (his only appearance with Nelson), Paul Chambers and Roy Haynes. Baritone saxophonist George Barrow does not take solos, but still remains a key feature in the subtle voicings of Nelson's arrangements\n\nWriting in the December 21, 1961 issue of Down Beat magazine jazz critic Don DeMicheal commented: &quot;Nelson's playing is like his writing: thoughtful, unhackneyed, and well constructed. Hubbard steals the solo honors with some of his best playing on record. Dolphy gets off some good solos too, his most interesting one on &quot;Yearnin'.&quot;\n\nThe Jazz Journal International cited the album as &quot;one of the essential post-bop recordings.&quot;\n\nThe Blues and the Abstract Truth mp3 320Kbps\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll tracks composed by Nelson.\n\n&quot;Stolen Moments&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8:46\n&quot;Hoe-Down&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:43\n&quot;Cascades&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:32\n&quot;Yearnin'&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:24\n&quot;Butch and Butch&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:35\n&quot;Teenie's Blues&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:33\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fec6e9daf72dd9ab19a632b7795520275f3dac26","amp;dn":"Oliver+Nelson+-+The+Blues+and+the+Abstract+Truth+%281961%29+jazz+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fec6e9daf72dd9ab19a632b7795520275f3dac26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,198,233,218,247,45,217,171,25,166,50,183,121,85,32,39,95,61,172,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
