Did cholera pave the way for modern Manhattan? Did yellow fever help end the slave trade? Remarkably, the answer to all of these questions is yes. Time and again, diseases have impacted the course of human history in surprisingly powerful ways. From influenza to small pox, from tuberculosis to yellow fever, Bryn Barnard describes the symptoms and paths of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worst diseasesÃ¢â‚¬â€œand how the epidemics they spawned have changed history forever.\n\nHighlighted with vivid and meticulously researched illustrations, Outbreak is a fascinating look at the hidden world of microbesÃ¢â‚¬â€œand how this world shapes human destiny every day.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e6c31a3e1f0bfe4529063f6024feb27a2e1c25c","amp;dn":"Outbreak%21+Plagues+That+Changed+History","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e6c31a3e1f0bfe4529063f6024feb27a2e1c25c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,108,49,163,225,240,191,228,82,144,99,246,2,79,235,39,162,225,194,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
