Very nice soundtrack, especially &quot;Summer&quot;, &quot;The Rain&quot; and &quot;River Side&quot;. The movie is also quite relaxing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbacc521243233e8bb55200c539275291413706c","amp;dn":"%E8%8F%8A%E6%AC%A1%E9%83%8E%E3%81%AE%E5%A4%8F+OST+%2F+Kikujiro+no+Natsu+Soundtrack+%5BGhost%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbacc521243233e8bb55200c539275291413706c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,172,197,33,36,50,51,232,187,85,32,12,83,146,117,41,20,19,112,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
