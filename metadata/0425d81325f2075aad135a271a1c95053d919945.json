Instead of focusing on how to sidestep or compensate for perceived differences, they dig deeper, to the core of our souls, to examine how the basic desires and needs of all people make us more alike than different. \n\nThe Seven Desires of Every Heart explores the common desires God gives youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to be heard, affirmed, blessed, safe, touched, chosen, and included. Using stories, Biblical references, and sound psychological principles, the Laasers explain each desire and show us how we seek it and what it feels like to have it truly fulfilled. You also will learn healthy ways to embody these desires in your relationships. You will be given the tools you need to start repairing and rebuilding relationships and developing new skills for creating emotional and spiritual intimacy.\n\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0425d81325f2075aad135a271a1c95053d919945","amp;dn":"The+Seven+Desires+of+Every+Heart-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0425d81325f2075aad135a271a1c95053d919945","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,37,216,19,37,242,7,90,173,19,90,39,26,28,149,5,61,145,153,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
