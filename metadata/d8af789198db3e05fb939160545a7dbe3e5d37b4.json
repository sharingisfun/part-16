Evans\\&amp;#039;s father died three days before the performance, and the pianist is not at his nuanced, otherworldly best. However, two original compositions are included--\\&quot;One For Helen,\\&quot; and the four-part requiem, \\&quot;In Memory of His Father, Harry L. Evans, 1891-1966.\\&quot; This somber solo piece draws on some earlier material, including its \\&quot;Epilogue,\\&quot; which was originally recorded on EVERYBODY DIGS BILL EVANS, but the delicate, Satie-tinged \\&quot;Prologue\\&quot; is all new, and the central section yielded \\&quot;Turn Out the Stars,\\&quot; which would become one of Evans\\&amp;#039;s most well-known songs. The entire \\&quot;In Memory\\&quot; suite was performed only once again by Evans, in 1968 in memory of Robert Kennedy.\n\nPersonnel: Bill Evans (piano); Chuck Israels (bass); Arnold Wise (drums).\n\nRecorded live at Town Hall, New York, New York on February 21, 1966.\n\nTrack Listings:\n1.
