After the Surrender of Japan, he was forced to return to his home country. On his trip home, he penned seven love letters to express his regret for leaving Kojima Tomoko, who originally planned to elope with him to Japan.\n\nPresent day rocker Aga (Van) returns to his hometown Hengchun after he failed to make it as a musician in Taipei. His step-father (Huang Hsi Tien) the town council chairman assists in arranging a concert for him; heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the leading singer accompanied by few local talents. \n\nThe concert is organized by Tomoko (Chie Tanaka), a Japanese model getting nowhere in the town. Against all odds the two proceed with their plan. After accidentally reading the half a century old love letters from Japan, Aga found himself in a similar dilemma with the Tomoko in his life. Two love stories, over 50 years in time difference are now intertwined in this best grossing Taiwanese film ever. \n\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c15c37a3b4f8ce7f5ef57c8e76a0cce55165fbcd","amp;dn":"Cape+No.+7+XVID+DVD+Rip+with+English+hard+subs+-+final+release","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c15c37a3b4f8ce7f5ef57c8e76a0cce55165fbcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,92,55,163,180,248,206,127,94,245,124,142,118,160,204,229,81,101,251,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
