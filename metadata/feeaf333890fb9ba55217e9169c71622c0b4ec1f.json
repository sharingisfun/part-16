You&amp;#039;ve Been a Lovely Audience.\nLive in Dublin\n\nThis is the concert portion of the DVD.  There&amp;#039;s nothing glitzy about this concert; just Sinead and some very good Irish musicians doing what they do best.  Among those performing with O&amp;#039;Conner are Sharon Shannon, Carol Isaacs, Clare Kenny, Rob Wickham and John D. Reynolds.  Taped live at Vicar Street in Dublin.  108 minutes.  (There are a couple of minor audio glitches which are on the original dvd---they are very, very slight and aren&amp;#039;t that great of a distraction.)\n\n\nThe 2002/03 issue also contains interviews with musicians who have worked with Sinead and several music videos from O&amp;#039;Connor&amp;#039;s Sean nos Nua period.  If there&amp;#039;s any interest in that portion of the DVD, please leave a comment and I will do my best to create another torrent.  (I may also try to rip the audio from the concert and upload it in MP3 format.) \n\n\nThis is my first attempt at ripping and re-authoring a dvd using DivX. Not sure if a smaller file could&amp;#039;ve been made.  Suggestions are welcome.\n\nThe file can be played with the free DivX player, or with GOM---another free program.\n\nEnjoy and please seed.\n\n1. Molly Malone\n2. Oro Se Do Bheatha Bhaile\n3.
