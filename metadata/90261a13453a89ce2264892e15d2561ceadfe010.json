He is generally considered to be the founder of modern community organizing. He is often noted for his book Rules for Radicals.\n\nIn the course of nearly four decades of political organizing, Alinsky received much criticism, but also gained praise from many public figures. His organizing skills were focused on improving the living conditions of poor communities across North America. In the 1950s, he began turning his attention to improving conditions of the African-American ghettos, beginning with Chicago's and later traveling to other ghettos in California, Michigan, New York City, and a dozen other &quot;trouble spots&quot;.\n\nHis ideas were later adapted by some U.S. college students and other young organizers in the late 1960s and formed part of their strategies for organizing on campus and beyond.[5] Time magazine once wrote that &quot;American democracy is being altered by Alinsky's ideas,&quot; and conservative author William F. Buckley said he was &quot;very close to being an organizational genius.&quot;[4]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90261a13453a89ce2264892e15d2561ceadfe010","amp;dn":"Reveille+for+Radicals+-+Saul+Alinsky","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90261a13453a89ce2264892e15d2561ceadfe010","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,38,26,19,69,58,137,206,34,100,137,46,21,210,86,28,234,223,224,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
