After many early recordings, including split tapes with cybergore project S.M.E.S. and Polish death metal band Mastectomia, Fuck the Facts began developing a name in the underground with grindcore and noise fans. In 2000, the first full-length CD-R, Discoing the Dead, was recorded. The positive feedback led to Topon assembling a full band to continue with the project in 2001.\nFuck the Facts took its name from the title of a Naked City song. \n&quot;Bastardized grindcore&quot; is a term coined by the band to self-describe their sound. \n[/quote]\n\n\nPack includes - \nSplit with S.M.E.S.\nBastardising Canada 2002 tour\nBackstabber Ettiquette\nDiscoing the dead (remastered)\nSplit with Feeble minded \nSplit with Silvester stalline\nSplit with No refund and Mermaid in a manhole &quot;Great one&quot; (three way split)\nSplit with Sergent slaughter\nLegacy of hopelesness\nMullet fever (remastered)\nCollection of Splits\nSplit with Pleasant valley\nSplit with Mesrine\nStigmata High-five\n\nVarious bitrates, and thanks to the original uploader :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f75d29c0e4cbb3b30b3b98fcc020efefe8d77d1d","amp;dn":"Fuck+the+facts+pack+-+www.metal-legions.com","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f75d29c0e4cbb3b30b3b98fcc020efefe8d77d1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,93,41,192,228,203,179,179,11,59,152,252,192,32,239,239,232,215,125,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
