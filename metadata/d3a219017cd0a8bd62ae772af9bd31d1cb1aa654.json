All three trains were developed alongside each other and shared common components and layout Ã¢â‚¬â€œ noticeable differences on the ICE VT were its crescent-shaped bogie supports and the removal of pantographs. \n\nThe ICE VT Ã¢â‚¬â€œ later to be more commonly known as the ICE TD Ã¢â‚¬â€œ was built by a Bombardier and Siemens consortium, and a four-car configuration chosen, without a restaurant car. The first trainset was assembled in 1998 and in 2001, all 20 units were commissioned for Deutsche Bahn and today operate on many electrified lines in Germany, despite being diesel powered. \n\nThe BR 605 ICE TD for Train Simulator is available in Deutsche Bahn livery and features PZB and LZB signalling, SIFA and AFB driver vigilance devices, a tilting mechanism and passenger view","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3a219017cd0a8bd62ae772af9bd31d1cb1aa654","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2015+DB+BR+605+ICE+TD+Add-On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3a219017cd0a8bd62ae772af9bd31d1cb1aa654","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,162,25,1,124,208,168,189,98,174,119,42,249,189,49,209,203,26,166,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
