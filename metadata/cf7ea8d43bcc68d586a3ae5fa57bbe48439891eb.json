Military\nplanners and others are attempting to use these breakthroughs to create\na more directed and controlled society while ignoring the positive\napplications of many of these new discoveries. This video delivers an\noverview and update on the HAARP material, cell phones, privacy,\nunderwater sonars other areas of technology. The challenges these new\ntechnologies present will shape the nature of freedom and liberty in\nways never contemplated in the past. Systems have been developed which\nwill have far reaching effects on the environment, human health and the\ndirection of free people. The DVD includes discussion intended to\nstimulate debate and while educating the public on these pressing issues\nof the 21st century.\n\nThis volume is much more info based and no products being explained/sold.\nGreat HAARP update &amp; basic info. Large section on privacy concerns with\ncell phone tracking RFID chips and other police state/marketing tool\nsurveillance technologies. Also some talk about Sonar and other magnetic\nfield/electric pollution. Overall I found it to be harder hitting then\nthe 1st one though perhaps not as positive (1st one had positive tech use\nthis on is more about fear of bad use). This will be all of this series\nfor now until the next ones are released, Cheers &amp; Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf7ea8d43bcc68d586a3ae5fa57bbe48439891eb","amp;dn":"Nick+Begich+-+Earth+Rising%2C+Vol.2+-+Technologies+in+the+21st+Cen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf7ea8d43bcc68d586a3ae5fa57bbe48439891eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,126,168,212,59,204,104,213,134,163,174,95,165,123,190,72,67,152,145,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
