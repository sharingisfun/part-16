Though their music was initially\ncategorised as progressive rock, they have since incorporated a combination of traditional\nrock and art rock into their music.

Supertramp were also well known for their\nprominent use of the Wurlitzer electric piano and saxophone. The band's early work included\nambitious concept albums; they would enjoy greater critical, and commercial success when\nthey ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works in the late 1970s, going on to\nsell more than 60 million albums. They reached their peak of commercial success under\nHodgson's leadership: 1979's Breakfast in America, their most popular album, has sold more\nthan 20 million copies.\n\nSupertramp enjoyed multiple international hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including:\n&quot;Dreamer&quot;, &quot;Give a Little Bit&quot;, &quot;The Logical Song&quot;, &quot;Breakfast in America&quot;, &quot;Goodbye\nStranger&quot;, &quot;Take the Long Way Home&quot;, &quot;It's Raining Again&quot; and &quot;Cannonball&quot;.
