Often overlooked because of Haydn's massive output in other areas, these sonatas show a clear development in terms of both classical sonata form and Haydn's compositional style. These sonatas don't get the credit they deserve, so go ahead and take a listen.\n\nPerformed by John McCabe\n\nThis torrent has exactly the contents of the box set released by Decca, and as such contains several sets of variations, several single movements for piano, and the Seven Last Words of Christ for piano. Sonatas are numbered according to the Landon scheme, and note that sonatas numbered 21-27 are lost.\n\nEncoded in FLAC compression-level 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Tagging is done as follows:\nArtist == Composer\nAlbum == Name of the work\nTitle == Title of a part or movement in a work\nGenre == The performer(s)\nTrack == Merely orders the files within a folder so that the files will be organised if there is more than one performer for a certain piece.\n\nI've done filenames as &quot;%PARENT_DIR%/Album/Track. [Performer] Title&quot;\n\n\n\nIf there are any skips or pops in the files that I have missed, please comment and I will fix and upload that piece.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94ef53f4072df287c08c0f8ee1f8602d5593317e","amp;dn":"Haydn+-+Complete+piano+sonatas+%28John+McCabe%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94ef53f4072df287c08c0f8ee1f8602d5593317e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,239,83,244,7,45,242,135,192,140,15,142,225,248,96,45,85,147,49,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
