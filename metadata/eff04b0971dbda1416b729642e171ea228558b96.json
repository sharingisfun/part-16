Active in the United States after 1934, his intellectual concerns were the dehumanizing effects of capitalism and modern technology.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s he became known as the preeminent theorist of the New Left and the student movements of Germany, France, and the USA. Celebrated by some as the &quot;Father of the New Left,&quot; his best known works include Reason and Revolution (1940), a dialectical study of Hegel and Marx, and One-Dimensional Man (1964). His Marxist scholarship inspired many radical intellectuals and political activists in the 1960s and '70s, both in the U.S. and internationally.\n\n\nAll of the following books are in PDF format:\n\n* The Aesthetic Dimension: Toward a Critique of Marxist Aesthetics (Beacon, 1978)\n\n* Collected Papers, Vol. 1: Technology, War &amp; Fascism (Routledge, 1998)\n* Collected Papers, Vol. 2: Towards a Critical Theory of Society (Routledge, 2001)\n* Collected Papers, Vol. 3: The New Left &amp; the 1960s (Routledge, 2005)\n* Collected Papers, Vol. 4: Art and Liberation (Routledge, 2007)\n* Counter-Revolution and Revolt (Beacon, 1972)\n* Critique of Pure Tolerance [with Robert P.
