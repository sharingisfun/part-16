It just makes sense to have one of the great songwriting documentarians of the weird, wonderful, holy and sacrilegious aspects of the American South on board to document something with as broad a title as The Americans: Part 1: The Lay of the Land. The play, based on the collected works of Sam Shepherd, was performed at the Juliard Drama School in February of 2010 and White, along with Dan Nettles, composed a set of 16 songs to go along with the play. Jim White presents: Sounds of the Americans isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t the proper follow-up to his 2007 album Transnormal Skiperoo, but it does echo the more whimsical, darkly weird and fantastic storytelling aspects of WhiteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s oeuvre.\n\nThe album is bookended by covers, but of different varieties. It opens with WhiteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s take on Daniel JohnstonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSpeeding Motorcycle,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a jangly, uptempo version that explodes in a joyous and rambunctious tone. The songÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s metaphor of heart as motorcycle is appropriate for some of the themes of love that bubble up in various forms across the record. Two spoken-word pieces titled, appropriately, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLetter 1ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLetter 2? find a teenage girlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s diary entries as they lament over how to approach someone. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRamblerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ pontificates about the excellent nature of the titular car and how it was the best one ever ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmade in the U.S.A.,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as it gets passed down from a father to son in a scene that recalls Richard ThompsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œVincent Black Lightning 1952.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Love even surfaces in a series of pieces where newspaper articles recall odd events like the man who claims, as the victim of a rear-end collision, that his heterosexuality has been switched off in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBut I Love HerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or the accidental vengeful murder in the middle of a church in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHunters Groove.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThere are moments of more pure Americana culture as well. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSimulacrumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sounds like a technological chant of devotion to consumerism; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSuckerz PromisesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ takes the same embrace of the American Dream and mocks it as a mugÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s game; and a forward-thinking evangelist in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEsoteric Text Found in a Religious Garbage CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ uses Biblical text to proffer that good and loving Christians take to the heavens to find and minister to their unconverted alien brethren. All of these are mixed in a hodgepodge of blues, r&amp;b, rock, country and musique concrete that take the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“melting potÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ metaphor to its natural conclusion as the backdrop to the diverse and devoted voices of the narrators.\n\nThe last track, and the other ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“cover,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is a re-working of WhiteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBluebird,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ originally from 2004's Drill a Hole in that Substrate.. In a conversation with White years ago, around the time of the release of ..Substrate, he expressed a desire to have others sing his own music ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ to play on the tracks himself, but have others voice the words he wrote. What starts as a nearly music-less opening driven only by the female singerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice slowly becomes an amazing channeling of the originalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s haunting examination of desperation into a much more hopeful and daring piece. As a conclusion, it loops back on the opening sentiments of love and brings about WhiteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own wishes from years ago and finds them actualized. As a documentation of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe Americans,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ it couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get much more perfect than that.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/25/jim-white/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/25/jim-white/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46bc1237799ea775626c1bf0f06ec749b4710319","amp;dn":"Jim+White...Sounds+Of+The+Americans%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46bc1237799ea775626c1bf0f06ec749b4710319","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,188,18,55,121,158,167,117,98,108,27,240,240,110,199,73,180,113,3,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
