Songs played by the two guitarists include songs by Ron Wood, Bo Diddley, The Faces and the Rolling Stones. Rolling Stone and The Originator combine their efforts while performing at the Ritz in New York City in 1987.\nMost of the songs are Bo Diddley's originals, already classics of Blues. Others are written by Ron Wood, The Rolling Stones and The Faces. Songs vary from shorter versions to compositions that spin more than 7 minutes featuring guitar work of B &amp; Ronnie as well as done on instrumental &quot;Plynth&quot;.\n\nTwo guitars lead the album (guitarists sing as well and one is Ron Wood to surprise of many), but harp and keyboard playing by keyboardist Hal Goldstein should be emphasized.\n\nBo Diddley's opening track &quot;Road Runner&quot;, The Rolling Stones' &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot; and &quot;Money To Ronnie&quot; are of particular taste.\n\nOne and only album of its kind. Pure rocky Blues. Recommended to all fans of Bo Diddley.
