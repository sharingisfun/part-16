Great Books of the Western World [REDUX]\n\n\nBy reading and studying the book sets featured in this self-study pack, you will learn a lot about a great variety of subjects on man, society, and the world at large and in the process you will acquire an informal liberal education - thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s at least the premise behind these book sets.\n\nAs the name suggests, the core contents of this self-study pack revolves around the book set Great Books of the Western World as well as a few complementary book sets such as Harvard Classics and Gateway to the Great Books. The &quot;REDUX&quot; suffix is simply a catch-all term that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve applied for various additional contents that I've added alongside this main book set, such as more up-to-date translations of the works included, audio podcasts and additional reading material for each volume, etc (most of this additional material is not included in the barebones edition of this package).\n\nThe book sets featured in this study pack are a combination of original volumes (those I were able to locate) and custom substitutes for these original volumes (where that was applicable/warranted). Many original volumes are missing in this release and not all original volumes come with custom substitutes, but the combined coverage of original and custom volumes covers all volumes for the included book sets. That is, all volumes are covered either by one or the other type, or by both.\n\nMy intention has been to create a package that would not merely contain any random editions of the classic works featured in these book sets, but a package that to the greatest possible extent would contain good editions with good and up-to-date translations, and a package that on top of that also would contain some helpful additional material to aid the reading process - as this study package is geared towards self-study.\n\n*** USAGE GUIDELINES ***\n\nDue to file system restrictions and potential file name issues that may arise from the lengthy file paths used, the best way to use this package is to simply mount the ISO image file as it is, with its own virtual drive letter. However, if you prefer to unpack its contents to a drive, then it should be unpacked as a folder to the root of a drive, either with the default folder name &quot;lib.edu.ssp&quot; used in the accompanying batch scripts or with some other folder name not exceeding the length of this default one. In Windows, the best way to unpack the image is to first mount it to a drive letter and then to copy/paste this drive letter to the preferred destination drive's root as this will automatically give it the default folder name.\n\n\n*** IMPORTANT COMPATIBILITY ISSUES - PLEASE READ BEFORE DOWNLOADING ***\n\nThis package requires a Windows-compatible operating system as it makes use of custom-made shortcuts in the form of Windows executables, which are essential to the use of this study package.\n\nThere are however also accompanying Windows batch scripts with which you can convert this package into a platform-independent package by replacing the custom-made shortcuts with standard Windows shortcuts or eliminate shortcuts altogether. However, importantly, you'll still need a one-time access to a Windows platform in order to run these included scripts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af0ef2e3158ab73fb192f0b0043903cc374fb987","amp;dn":"Liberal+Education+Self-Study+Pack+%5BBarebones+Edition%5D+%28v1.1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af0ef2e3158ab73fb192f0b0043903cc374fb987","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,14,242,227,21,138,183,63,177,146,240,176,4,57,3,204,55,79,185,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
