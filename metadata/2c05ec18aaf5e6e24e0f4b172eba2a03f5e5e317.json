His musical style is often considered a blend of Southern rock, blues, and traditional country. He is the son of legendary country music singer Hank Williams and the father of Hank Williams III, Holly Williams, Hilary Williams, Samuel Williams, and Katie Williams.\n\nWilliams began his career by following in his famed father's footsteps, singing his father's songs and imitating his father's style. Williams's own style slowly evolved as he struggled to find his own voice and place within the country music industry. This trend was interrupted by a near-fatal fall off the side of Ajax Peak in Montana on August 8, 1975. After an extended recovery, he challenged the country music establishment with a blend of country, rock, and blues. Williams enjoyed much success in the 1980s, from which he earned considerable recognition and popularity both inside and outside the country music industry.\n\nAs a multi-instrumentalist, Williams's repertoire of skills include guitar, bass guitar, upright bass, steel guitar, banjo, dobro, piano, keyboards, harmonica, fiddle, and drums.\n\nFrom 1989 until October 2011, a version of his song &quot;All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight&quot; was used as the opening for broadcasts of Monday Night Football.\n\nAlbumlist:\n\n\n1975 - Hank Williams Jr. &amp; Friends\n1977 - One Night Stands\n1977 - The New South\n1979 - Family Tradition\n1979 - Whiskey Bent And Hell Bound\n1980 - Habits Old And New\n1981 - Rowdy\n1981 - The Pressure Is On\n1982 - High Notes\n1983 - Man Of Steel\n1983 - Strong Stuff\n1984 - Major Moves\n1985 - Five-O-Five\n1986 - Montana CafÃƒÂ©\n1987 - Born To Boogie\n1987 - Hank Live\n1988 - Wild Streak\n1990 - Lone Wolf\n1991 - Pure Hank\n1992 - Maverick\n1993 - Out Of Left Field\n1995 - Hog Wild\n1996 - A.K.A.
