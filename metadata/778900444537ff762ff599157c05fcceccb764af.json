The kid-friendly favorite is now being spotted at the trendiest restaurants around town, and this fantastic cookbook has it all. More than 50 classics range from the tried-and-true Yankee Doodle Dandy Baked Macaroni and Cheese and quick to prepare specialties such as the yodel-worthy Alpine Macaroni with Appenzeller and Creme Fraiche to international specialties like Giuvetchi, a Greek dish of orzo in a cinnamon tomato sauce with lamb and kasseri, myzithra, and feta cheeses. There are even a few dessert versions like Falooda, a traditional Indian treat, this one using ricotta and sweet vermicelli, with cherries and a touch of cardamom. Recipes for side salads and soups help round out a balanced meal. Mac &amp; cheeseÃ¢â‚¬â€it'll always please.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:778900444537ff762ff599157c05fcceccb764af","amp;dn":"Macaroni+%26amp%3B+Cheese+-+Marlena+Spieler.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"778900444537ff762ff599157c05fcceccb764af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,137,0,68,69,55,255,118,47,245,153,21,124,5,252,206,204,183,100,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
