ItÃ¢Â€â„¢s obvious the band feels comfortable here at Trax in Charlottesville, VA, their original stomping ground. This can be seen when Dave introduces &quot;Satellite&quot; as a song by Elvis, or when the band members stop to say hello to Dave's sister, Jane, before playing the now classic tune â€œThe Song That Jane Likes.â€ You can feel the vibrant energy of a band certainly on the rise.\r\n\r\n&quot;The Best of What's Around&quot; starts as a slower, blusier version than its present day form and heads straight into a smoking version of &quot;Help Myself.&quot; Early in the set &quot;Jimi Thing&quot; gets the full funk treatment and everyone gets a turn to cut loose - from Boyd on violin, to Peter on keys, to LeRoi â€œDoctor Xâ€ Moore on the saxophone - and closes out with a group singalong vocal. The relatively new and beautifully stripped down &quot;Seek Up,&quot; with flourishes from Carter and LeRoi, serves as a nice intro into &quot;Typical Situation.&quot; Other highlights in this release include Dave solo on &quot;Drive In, Drive Out,&quot; &quot;Lie In Our Graves,&quot; and a very rare cover of Led ZeppelinÃ¢Â€â„¢s &quot;Tangerine.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36923b4b33a11dea97de68c50b2573a444cb0650","amp;dn":"Dave+Matthews+Band+1992-07-28+Trax+Nightclub+Charlottesville%2C+VA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36923b4b33a11dea97de68c50b2573a444cb0650","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,146,59,75,51,161,29,234,151,222,104,197,11,37,115,164,68,203,6,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
