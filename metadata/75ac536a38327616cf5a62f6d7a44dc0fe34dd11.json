Originally known as &quot;Zero Tolerance&quot;, Keith had been the only constant member of the band during their years of touring and recording albums. The group was initially signed by Dr. Strange Records and were then signed to Fat Wreck Chords. Face to Face rose to fame with their 1994 second album Big Choice, featuring their radio hit &quot;Disconnected&quot;, which was first played by KROQ and appeared in the movies Tank Girl and National Lampoon's Senior Trip.\n\nFace to Face officially split up in September 2004, because of musical differences. Since then, all the members of the band had played in a number of post-Face to Face projects, including Legion of Doom, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, The Offspring and Saves the Day. In April 2008, Face to Face performed together for the first time in four years at The Glasshouse in Pomona, California.[3] The band has continued to perform numerous live venues since, and released a seventh studio album, Laugh Now, Laugh Later, on May 17, 2011.\n\nDuring their initial twelve year run, Face to Face became one of the seminal and influential punk rock bands to come out of California, along with Blink-182, Green Day, Bad Religion, The Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise, No Use for a Name, Lagwagon, The Vandals, Guttermouth, Good Riddance, and many others. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShoot The Moon - The Definitive Collection 2005\n\n\nShoot the Moon: The Essential Collection is a greatest hits album by the punk band Face to Face. It was released on November 15, 2005, a year after the band had dissolved. It features songs from all of the band's albums except for Ignorance is Bliss and their cover album Standards &amp; Practices.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Disconnected&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;I Want&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;You've Done Nothing&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Pastel&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Don't Turn Away&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;You Lied&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Velocity&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;A-OK&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;It's Not Over&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Blind&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Ordinary&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;I Won't Lie Down&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;Complicated&quot;  \n14.\t&quot;Walk the Walk&quot; (Live)\n15.\t&quot;I'm Trying&quot; (Live)\n16.\t&quot;Disappointed&quot;  \n17.\t&quot;What's in a Name?&quot;  \n18.\t&quot;Bill of Goods&quot;  \n19.\t&quot;A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing&quot;  \n20.\t&quot;Thick as a Brick&quot;  \n21.\t&quot;Disconnected&quot; (Live)\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75ac536a38327616cf5a62f6d7a44dc0fe34dd11","amp;dn":"Face+to+Face+-+Shoot+Moon+%28Greatest+Hits%29+2005+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75ac536a38327616cf5a62f6d7a44dc0fe34dd11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,172,83,106,56,50,118,22,207,90,98,246,215,164,77,192,254,52,221,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
