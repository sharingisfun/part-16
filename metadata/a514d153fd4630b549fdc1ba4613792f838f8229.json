(also variously titled Diary of Forbidden Dreams, Che?, Quoi?, and Was? in different countries) is a comedy movie written and directed by Roman Polanski in 1972, starring Marcello Mastroianni, Sydne Rome and Hugh Griffith.\n\n\nSet in an unnamed coastal city in Italy, the movie tells a story of an American girl, Nancy (Sydne Rome) who, after a rape attempt, takes shelter in a villa where strange guests go around. There she gets into a relationship with a retired pimp Alex (Marcello Mastroianni).\n\nNancy's adventures have been paralleled to those of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, although turned into erotic ones. Critics have also pointed out the movie's lack of connectiveness and the excessive absurdity of several situations.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a514d153fd4630b549fdc1ba4613792f838f8229","amp;dn":"What+1972.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a514d153fd4630b549fdc1ba4613792f838f8229","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,20,209,83,253,70,48,181,73,253,193,186,70,19,121,47,131,143,130,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
