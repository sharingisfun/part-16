The well-rounded set is highlighted by tasteful and swinging versions of five standards (including John Coltrane's &quot;Countdown,&quot; &quot;It Might As Well Be Spring,&quot; and &quot;From This Moment On&quot;) and four of the pianist's originals. This CD (which is sometimes available at a budget price) serves as a fine start to what should be a productive career. \n\n\n01. It Might As Well Be Spring\n02. Countdown\n03. My Romance\n04.
