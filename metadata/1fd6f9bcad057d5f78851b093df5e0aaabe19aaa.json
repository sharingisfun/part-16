Nature 'A well written graduate-level text for scientists and engineers... Highly recommended for graduate-level libraries.' Choice\n\nThis highly successful text, which first appeared in the year 1972 and has continued to be popular ever since, has now been brought up-to-date by incorporating the remarkable developments in the field of 'phase transitions and critical phenomena' that took place over the intervening years. This has been done by adding three new chapters (comprising over 150 pages and containing over 60 homework problems) which should enhance the usefulness of the book for both students and instructors. We trust that this classic text, which has been widely acclaimed for its clean derivations and clear explanations, will continue to provide further generations of students a sound training in the methods of statistical physics. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fd6f9bcad057d5f78851b093df5e0aaabe19aaa","amp;dn":"Statistical+Mechanics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fd6f9bcad057d5f78851b093df5e0aaabe19aaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,214,249,188,173,5,125,95,120,133,27,9,61,245,224,170,171,225,154,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
