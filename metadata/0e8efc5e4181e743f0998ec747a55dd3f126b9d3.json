She hires recovering alcoholic Dave Nash as foreman and a crew of Ivey's enemies. Ivey fights back with violence and destruction, but Dave is determined to counter him legally... a feeling not shared by his associates. Connie's boast that, as a woman, she doesn't need guns proves justified, but plenty of gunplay results.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e8efc5e4181e743f0998ec747a55dd3f126b9d3","amp;dn":"Ramrod++%28Western+1947%29++Joel+Mccrea%2C+Don+Defore+%26amp%3B+Veronica+L","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e8efc5e4181e743f0998ec747a55dd3f126b9d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,142,252,94,65,129,231,67,240,153,142,199,71,165,93,211,241,38,185,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
