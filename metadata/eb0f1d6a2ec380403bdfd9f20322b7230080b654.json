The Wakhi shepherds of north-east Afghanistan are one of the world's last truly traditional herding cultures. The Wakhi live as they have done for thousands of years, at the mercy of nature and utterly dependent on their animals for survival. Though she learns that there is nothing romantic about life in such a tough environment, Kate discovers strong, proud people, whose close and vital bond with their animals echoes the ten thousand year-old relationship between shepherd and flock.\n\n2)  Peru \nKate gets to grips with an unfamiliar animal - the alpaca - living with alpaca herders in the Peruvian High Andes. Here she discovers an ancient culture at a crossroads between tradition and progress. The Inca Empire is famous for architectural achievements, but the ancient people of the Andes were as skilled herders as they were builders, producing some of the finest textiles the world has ever seen. Kate travels to the mountains of southern Peru to live with the Incas' modern-day descendants to see if any of this heritage remains. She discovers an ancient culture based around alpaca herding, and immerses herself in everyday life - herding and shearing animals, assisting with dramatic births, spinning and weaving alpaca fibre, and feasting on roasted guinea pig. But the people here are struggling to make ends meet - lack of pasture and poor quality animals threaten this traditional way of life. Kate sets off in search of solutions, but soon learns that the whole alpaca industry is on a knife-edge. Only by re-learning the skills of their Inca ancestors can Peruvians secure the future of alpaca herding in the High Andes.\n\n3)  Australia \nAustralia is a country that was founded on shepherding, and today it is one of the world's largest sheep producers. Kate heads into the parched and remote lands of the outback to Meka, one of the largest sheep stations in Australia. 25,000 sheep are raised on a million acres of pasture. Kate takes part in a muster, helping to round up sheep across a vast area using motorbikes and light aircraft. And she learns about the threats and controversies that embroil modern-day shepherds, from drought and wild dogs to live export. Kate meets farmers working to maintain Australia's position at the vanguard of the industry, employing the latest breeding technology and leading the way in embryo transfer and genetic testing. With the global demand for meat set to rise exponentially, Kate asks if this is the inevitable future of herding - or is there another way?\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/8125/9siq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/8125/9siq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/6939/qpfc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/6939/qpfc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/811/3m74.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/811/3m74.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/8154/k1z3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/8154/k1z3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/3512/6khw.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/3512/6khw.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img547.imageshack.us/img547/3488/3dys.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img547.imageshack.us/img547/3488/3dys.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img825.imageshack.us/img825/5660/4kxh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img825.imageshack.us/img825/5660/4kxh.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img571.imageshack.us/img571/3897/rjz7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img571.imageshack.us/img571/3897/rjz7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;064e6f616e464a352837&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 1534 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 Kbps CBR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 59mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 3\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Container: mp4\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p018hn4p/clips&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p018hn4p/clips&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb0f1d6a2ec380403bdfd9f20322b7230080b654","amp;dn":"BBC+Wild+Shepherdess+with+Kate+Humble+1of3+Afghanistan+PDTV+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb0f1d6a2ec380403bdfd9f20322b7230080b654","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,15,29,106,46,195,128,64,59,223,217,242,3,34,183,35,0,128,182,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
