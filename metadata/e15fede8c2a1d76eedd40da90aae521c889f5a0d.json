Released on Underground Resistance, the best techno label in the world - all tracks are UR releases or UR related. Live mix - no studio bullshit, you can hear Rolando nudging the vinyl to correct the beat mix. Sound varies from hard as fuck to wonderfully melodic - but funky as hell, all the way. Mustn't be missed. Enjoy, always fight the majors, stay low, stay underground, transmit these tones and wreak havoc on the programmers!\n\n/j-dog\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/release/47042&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/release/47042&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFrom Submerge:\n&quot;The Aztec Mystic Mix&quot; showcases the Latino avenger's skills behind the decks and in the studio as he spins four of his own tracks into a seamless set of old and new tunes from UR, 430 West, Red Planet and other Motor City imprints. From the quirky disco of Dark NRG's &quot;Witchdokta&quot; to the ragged electro of Drexciya's &quot;Bata Pumps&quot; and the joyous synth stabs of Suburban Knight's &quot;Midnite Sunshine,&quot; Rolando's set explores the diversity of Detroit's lesser-known producers. Besides the atmospheric intro, the only departure from rhythmic intensity is UR's &quot;Metamorphosis,&quot; a languorous interlude sandwiched between the chainsaw funk of &quot;Short Circuits&quot; and the gorgeous melody of Mad Mike's &quot;Illuminator.&quot; \n\nTRACK LISTING\n\n1.
