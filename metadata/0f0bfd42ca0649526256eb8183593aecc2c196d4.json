A nearly complete collection of Rock N Roll Comics. This is as good as it gets right now, but as new scans appear, this torrent will be updated! As you can see below, we are only missing 15 issues to make a complete run of 65. This torrent includes the recently scanned &quot;New Kids On The Block&quot; issue.
