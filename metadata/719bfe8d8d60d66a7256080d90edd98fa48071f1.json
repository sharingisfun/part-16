Similar to other 'earth after disaster' titles like Kamandi, Atomic Knights or the like, it was set the area around &quot;N'Yark&quot;, in an Earth devastated by a nuclear war.  Samson was a wandering barbarian adventurer. An apparent mutant, due to his size and strength, but one who did only good. \n\nMighty Samson lasted 32 issues between 1964-82.  The first issue was published in July 1964. The title was cancelled with #20 (1969).  Issues 7-20 each had a back-up story with the large-headed character Tom Morrow. Mighty Samson was brought back in 1972 (probably due to the popularity of Star Trek), and lasted until #31 in 1976.  The first two new issues were reprints; issue #21 (reprinting #7), and issue #22 (reprinting #2).  A final new story was published in Gold Key Champion #2 in 1978.  #32 (a reprint of #3, but with a line-art version of #4's cover) was published under the &quot;Whitman Comics&quot; line in 1982, and sold in a bag with Turok #130 and Dagar the Invincible #18.\n\nMighty Samson was created by writer Otto Binder and artist Frank Thorne.  Artist Jack Sparling tookover the artwork with #6, and Otto and Jack did the title through #20.  In the new issues beginning with #23, art was by Jose Delbo, and later by Jack Abel.\n\nProject Superpowers, a comic book from Alex Ross and Dynamite Entertainment announced in 2007, reviving many golden-age comic book characters will feature a Samson that is ostensibly the golden age Fox Features Samson, though the visual design seems to have been inspired by the Gold Key character.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:719bfe8d8d60d66a7256080d90edd98fa48071f1","amp;dn":"Mighty+Samson+%28Gold+Key%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"719bfe8d8d60d66a7256080d90edd98fa48071f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,155,254,141,141,96,214,106,114,86,8,13,144,237,217,143,164,128,113,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
