He foresaw new directions in science that have begun to produce practical applications only in the last decade: nanotechnology, atomic-scale biology like the manipulation of DNA, lasers to move individual atoms, and quantum engineering. In the 1960s, Feynman entered the field of quantum gravity and created important tools and techniques for scientists studying black holes and gravity waves. Author Krauss (The Physics of Star Trek), an MIT-trained physicist, doesn't necessarily break new ground in this biography, but Krauss excels in his ability, like Feynman himself, to make complicated physics comprehensible. He incorporates Feynman's lectures and quotes several of the late physicist's colleagues to aid him in this process. This book is highly recommended for readers who want to get to know one of the preeminent scientists of the 20th century. \n\nAmazon reader review:\n\nThis new volume, very well written by one of the best popular authors on physics, fills a gap in the Feynman bookshelf. At one end is the best biography of Feynman, &quot;Genius&quot; by James Gleick, which includes much personal history. At the other, &quot;QED&quot;, by Sylvan Schweber, which covers the entire sweep of the work by Feynman, Dyson, Schwinger, Tomonaga and others on quantum electrodynamics, the centerpiece of Feynman's legacy.\n\nKrauss writes a mainly scientific biography, and manages to cover this work without mathematical detail, but with well-chosen technical illustrations, which give the flavor of the work. Gleick provides much more on the personal life, and if you have the background, Schweber will fill in the details of QED. (If you want more background on Feynman diagrams, beyond the very good introduction in this book, I recommend &quot;Drawing Theories Apart&quot; by David Kaiser.)\n\nOf course one must also read Feynman's own popular writings, both his own and those co-authored, and at the undergraduate level I wish I had his &quot;Lectures on Physics&quot; when I was a student in the early 1950's.\n\nThe new Krauss book definitely deserves 5 stars.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8028072ad825fa64fe2957590cf52d6d0cd50416","amp;dn":"Lawrence+M+Krauss+-+Quantum+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8028072ad825fa64fe2957590cf52d6d0cd50416","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,40,7,42,216,37,250,100,254,41,87,89,12,245,45,109,12,213,4,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
