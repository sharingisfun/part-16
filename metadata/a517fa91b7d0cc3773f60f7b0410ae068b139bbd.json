This Johnny Taylor was definitely not the suave Sam Cooke protÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© who blitzed the charts with &quot;Who's Making Love&quot; for Stax in 1968; that's Johnnie Taylor, who added to the confusion by covering &quot;Part Time Love&quot; for Stax. Another similarity between the two Taylors: both hailed from strong gospel backgrounds. Little Johnny came to Los Angeles in 1950 and did a stint with the Mighty Clouds of Joy before going secular. Influenced by Little Willie John, he debuted as an R&amp;B artist with a pair of 45s for Hunter Hancock's Swingin' logo, but his career didn't soar until he inked a pact with Fantasy's Galaxy subsidiary in 1963 (where he benefited from crisp production by Cliff Goldsmith and Ray Shanklin's arrangements). The gliding mid-tempo blues &quot;You'll Need Another Favor,&quot; firmly in a Bobby Bland mode, was Taylor's first chart item. He followed it up with the tortured R&amp;B chart-topper &quot;Part Time Love,&quot; which found him testifying in gospel-fired style over Arthur Wright's biting guitar and a grinding, horn-leavened downbeat groove. The singer also did fairly well with &quot;Since I Found a New Love&quot; in 1964 and &quot;Zig Zag Lightning&quot; in 1966. Taylor's tenure at Stan Lewis' Ronn imprint elicited the slow blues smash &quot;Everybody Knows About My Good Thing&quot; in 1971, and a similarly witty hit follow-up, &quot;Open House at My House,&quot; the next year (both were covered later by Z.Z. Hill for Malaco). While at Ronn, Little Johnny cut some duets with yet another Taylor, this one named Ted (no, they weren't related either). Though he recorded only sparingly during the 1980s and 1990s, he remained an active performer until his death in 2002. ~ Bill Dahl, All Music Guide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a517fa91b7d0cc3773f60f7b0410ae068b139bbd","amp;dn":"Little+Johnny+Taylor+-+All+I+Want+is+You.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a517fa91b7d0cc3773f60f7b0410ae068b139bbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,23,250,145,183,208,204,55,115,246,15,123,4,16,174,6,139,19,155,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
