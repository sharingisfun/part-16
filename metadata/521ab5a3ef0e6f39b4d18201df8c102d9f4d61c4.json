It contains no game content changes, only modifications to the game engine for compatibility with Mac and Linux systems. As such, this release has no formal changelog.\n1.3.0.7 is an optional update that is still in development, requiring players to opt in before it will be installed. The beta is distributed through Steam's beta functionality; as such, only Steam copies of Terraria may opt into the 1.3.0.7 beta[2]. Mac and Linux users who choose to enter this open testing phase are asked to join the Open Beta Testing Feedback Group on the forums to provide feedback and bug reports.\nWhile 1.3.0.7 was released early due to the lack of sensitive &quot;spoiler&quot; content in its prerelease, open betas are not expected to become standard for testing of future updates","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:521ab5a3ef0e6f39b4d18201df8c102d9f4d61c4","amp;dn":"Terraria+v1.3.0.7+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"521ab5a3ef0e6f39b4d18201df8c102d9f4d61c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,26,181,163,239,14,111,57,180,209,130,1,223,140,16,45,159,77,97,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
