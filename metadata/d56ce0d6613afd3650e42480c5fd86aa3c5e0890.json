This is so whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a Roget-style thesaurus or a dictionary-style thesaurus.\n\nTo achieve a good command of fluency-relevant vocabulary, you need dedicated fluency-oriented vocabulary building books Ã¢â‚¬â€ books that focus on fluency-building vocabulary.\n\nAnd the Core Fluency Thesaurus is a dedicated fluency-oriented vocabulary building book Ã¢â‚¬â€ and the first thesaurus of its kind. From none other than Prof. Kev Nair, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foremost authority on fluency building. And it groups together, under headwords, word groups that express meanings similar to, or somewhat similar to, its important meanings. These are groups of words that individual words tend to form with other words, with a more-than-chance frequency: Phrases, collocations, phrasal verbs, idioms and other multi-word items that have the property of adding to your fluency. The author has marked how relatively frequent/important (for fluency training) a headword is with the indicators Ã¢â‚¬ËœAAAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœAAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Headwords marked Ã¢â‚¬ËœAAAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ are more frequent/important than those marked Ã¢â‚¬ËœAAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. And headwords marked Ã¢â‚¬ËœAAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ are more frequent/important than those marked Ã¢â‚¬ËœAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re an advanced user of English Ã¢â‚¬â€œ someone who has to make heavy use of fluent English in his/her everyday life Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you need this book.\n\nuploader's note:\n\nI would have said &quot;buy it if you like the book&quot; in any of my other uploads but Iam not going to say that to this book.\n\nBecause of their stupid DRM protection in all of their ebooks. You can't use DRM encrypted books to personalize or you know add comments for our own use. \n\nJust look at these stupid restrictions they impose on the buyer:\nFile format \tPDF\nPrinting \tNot Allowed\nCopying text \tNot Allowed\nModifying text \tNot Allowed\nDelivery mode \tOnline (over the Internet)\nBuyer information \tEmbedded in each file\nWatermarking \tWatermarked with copyright information and buyer identification information \n\nSo I can't take physical printouts of my purchase or copy text for my own legal personal use? You expect me to buy your books by you treating your potential customers like criminals? How will you know what buyer pirated your books if they scanned the books of the physical version and upload them? \n\nScrew you Adult Faculties Council.
