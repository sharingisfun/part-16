It helps to provide ITaaS, federate workloads, and enable the orchestration of common tasks and delivery items. This course will go through the individual components that make up vCAC and the purposes they serve. It will also look at interactions between the components as well as external integrations for provisioning,resource management, and reporting. Additionally, we will look at how vCAC fits into overall enterprise vSphere deployments and some common use cases. Finally, an architecture and deployment overview will serve as a lead into the upcoming Part 2 of this topic which will be an install/configure course.\n\n\n\nTopics include:\n\n1.Introduction to VMware vCloud Automation Center (vCAC)\n\n2.vCAC Overview\n\n3.vCloud Automation Center Identity Service\n\n4.vCloud Automation Center Server Service\n\n5.vCloud Automation Center IaaS\n\n6.vSphere and Other Required Infrastructure Components\n\n7.Architecture Overview and Deployment Options","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6de7c4abdba8621d86eb6c068d554c3d0710d771","amp;dn":"%5BPluralsight%5D+Introduction+to+VMware+vCloud+Automation+Center%28vC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6de7c4abdba8621d86eb6c068d554c3d0710d771","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,231,196,171,219,168,98,29,134,235,108,6,141,85,76,61,7,16,215,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
