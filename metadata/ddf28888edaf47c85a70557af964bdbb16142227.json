He is widely considered to be one of the greatest jazz pianists of all time, and is considered by some to have been the most influential post-World War II jazz pianist. Evans's use of impressionist harmony, inventive interpretation of traditional jazz repertoire, block chords, and trademark rhythmically independent, &quot;singing&quot; melodic lines continue to influence jazz pianists today. Unlike many other jazz musicians of his time, Evans never embraced new movements like jazz fusion or free jazz.\n\nCountry: USA\nGenre: Jazz\nQuality: 320 kbps\nAlbums:\n\n(1956) Bill Evans Trio - New Jazz Conceptions\n(1960) Bill Evans Trio - Portrait in Jazz\n(1961) Bill Evans Trio - Sunday at the Village Vanguard\n(1962) Bill Evans Trio - Moon Beams\n(1962) Bill Evans Trio - Undercurrent","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddf28888edaf47c85a70557af964bdbb16142227","amp;dn":"Bill+Evans+Trio+%285+Albums%29+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddf28888edaf47c85a70557af964bdbb16142227","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,242,136,136,237,175,71,200,90,112,85,122,249,100,189,187,22,20,34,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
