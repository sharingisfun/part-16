They took their name from the 1974 TV movie, directed by Jerry London, itself based on a Theodore Sturgeon short story. They released their first album, Intellectuals are the Shoeshine Boys of the Ruling Elite, in the same year. The band split in 1990 but reformed in 1993, losing guitarist Bill Hobson and gaining Paul Zagoras, and continued until they split up in 1996. Their farewell tour was officially titled &quot;Fuck You, We Quit!&quot;, and included Erik Tunison of Die Kreuzen in place of Dan Hobson on drums and Jeff Ditzenberger on additional guitar. The band released nine albums, including a post-breakup live CD, The Last Waltz.\n\nKilldozer was notable for its slow, grinding song structures and blackly humorous lyrics, growled ominously by singer/guitarist Michael Gerald at the top of his lungs. Many of their songs were disturbing narratives of small-town life gone awry, and later had a jaded, left wing political perspective. Killdozer is regarded by many to have helped set the foundation for grunge music, despite that genre's association with the city of Seattle.[3]\n\nThe band also became famous for its cover songs, an example being Don McLean's &quot;American Pie&quot;. A version exists on their 1989 all-covers album For Ladies Only. Gerald also did a cover of Jessi Colter's &quot;I'm Not Lisa&quot; for the band's 1986 EP Burl, dedicated &quot;in loving memory of&quot; the still-living-at-the-time Burl Ives. The EP in its entirety can be found on the CD version of their 1994 album Uncompromising War on Art Under the Dictatorship of the Proletariat.\n\nPS repost of my 3 yrs old torrent from demon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:635473b51f43381a219829d84abeb6d03e111b97","amp;dn":"Killdozer+%28repost+-+noise+rock%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"635473b51f43381a219829d84abeb6d03e111b97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,84,115,181,31,67,56,26,33,152,41,216,74,190,182,208,62,17,27,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
