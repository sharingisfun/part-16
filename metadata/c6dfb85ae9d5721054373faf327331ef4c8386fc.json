He won the heavyweight championship at age twenty-two by conquering Sonny Liston in dramatic fashion. The political establishment stripped him of his prize when he refused induction into the United States Army during the height of the war in Vietnam. Ultimately, Ali returned to reclaim his crown, prevailing in epic fights against the likes of Joe Frazier and George Foreman. His talent and charismaÃ¢â‚¬â€and above all, his adherence to principleÃ¢â‚¬â€made him a cultural icon and one of the most beloved sporting figures of all time.\n\n \n\nBut that is only half the tale. Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times is also the story of Ali, the man. Author Thomas Hauser got closer to Ali than any previous biographer. His workÃ¢â‚¬â€told in AliÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own words and those of hundreds of family members, friends, rivals, and others who interacted with Ã¢â‚¬Å“The GreatestÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ over the decadesÃ¢â‚¬â€reveals a deeply spiritual, complex man, who gave new meaning to the word courage and changed forever our conception of what makes a champion.\n\n \n\nThis ebook includes rare photos authorized by Muhammad Ali Enterprises.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6dfb85ae9d5721054373faf327331ef4c8386fc","amp;dn":"Muhammad+Ali%3A+His+Life+and+Times","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6dfb85ae9d5721054373faf327331ef4c8386fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,223,184,90,233,213,114,16,84,55,63,175,50,115,49,239,76,131,134,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
