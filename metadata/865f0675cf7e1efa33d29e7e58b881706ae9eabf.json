The journalist, though severed from his Jewish upbringing, was fiercely committed to social justice and could not ignore a shocking antisemitism in the fin-de-siÃƒÂ¨cle circles he knew. In searching for its historic causes, he was also searching for his own roots and place in the world. As biographer Nelly Wilsonhas noted, young Lazare was &quot;constantly engaged in a dialogue with himself&quot; when he wrote Antisemitism, Its History and Causes.\n\nLazare begins his &quot;impartial study&quot; by considering whatever in the Jewish character might be to blame for antisemitism. Then he looks outward to those nations among which the Israelites dispersed, examining the different faces of antisemitism from Greco-Roman antiquity to the end of the nineteenth century. Lazare brings his research and study to bear on whatever form antisemitism has taken: ethnic, nationalist, economic, social, literary, philosophical. Recognizing that antisemitism is fundamentally based on fear of the stranger and the need for a scapegoat, Lazare concludes with a surprising scenario for the future. This remarkable book conveys Lazare's own spiritual growth. France's Dreyfus Affair in the 1890s would galvanize him to a passionate battle against antisemitism","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:865f0675cf7e1efa33d29e7e58b881706ae9eabf","amp;dn":"Antisemitism%3A+Its+History+and+Causes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"865f0675cf7e1efa33d29e7e58b881706ae9eabf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,95,6,117,207,126,30,250,51,210,158,126,88,184,129,112,106,233,234,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
