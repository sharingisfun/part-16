He may be almost crippled with arthritis, but once his hands touch the keyboard he becomes transformed. His sheer technique is impressive even by classical standards, but what he does with it is dazzling--chromatic octave runs which are exhilaratingly off-key, chord-fusillades happening all over the piano at once. His key weapon is surprise--he knows exactly when to lurk in the shade, and when to burst forth. And he builds up his tapestries of sound like a sorcerer with a willing group of apprentices. Take the sixth track here, which is a slow &quot;son guajira&quot;: the trumpet flies high over soft percussion and a muted choral refrain, then in comes Ibrahim Ferrer's wild vocal in his characteristic slow vibrato, followed by Senegalese singer Cheikh Lo, while Gonzalez weaves his spell all round them--sometimes the sinewy foundation, sometimes the brightest star. He can be jokey or tender as the occasion demands in this collection of danzons, cha-chas, and boleros, but he radiates a pervasive authority. Listen to this record once, and you're hooked for good. --Michael Church &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Chanchullo-Ruben-Gonzalez/dp/B00004WMZN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Chanchullo-Ruben-Gonzalez/dp/B00004WMZN&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFeaturing\nIbrahim Ferrer, vocals\nCheikh Lo, vocals\nEliades Ochoa, guitar\nRy Cooder, guitar\nManuel &quot;Anga&quot; Diaz, congas\nOrlando &quot;Cachaito&quot; Lopez, bass\nManuel &quot;Guajiro&quot; Mirabal, trumpet\nRichard Egues, flute\n\nTracks\n1- Chanchullo.\n2- De una manera espantosa.\n3- La lluvia.\n4- Central Constancia.\n5- Quizas, quizas.\n6- Choco's guajira.\n7- Si te contara.\n8- El bodeguero.\n9- Isora club.\n10- Rico vacilon.\n11- Pa' gozar.\n\nArtwork (200dpi scan) included.\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e04cfceb78189435a57ca25ae400fa88439dfe5a","amp;dn":"%28Buena+Vista%29+Ruben+Gonzalez+-+Chanchullo+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e04cfceb78189435a57ca25ae400fa88439dfe5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,76,252,235,120,24,148,53,165,124,162,90,228,0,250,136,67,157,254,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
