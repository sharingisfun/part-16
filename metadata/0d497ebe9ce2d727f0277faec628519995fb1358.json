TheXerovyExpress - I'm Lost, I'm Lonely, I Just Wanna Go Home[03:50]\n\nPlaying Time.........: 22:40\nTotal Size...........: 42.56 MB\nFormat...............: MP3 V0\nSource...............: Taken from 24/96 masters\n\n\nMr Bo Diddly\n\nThis instrumental track was 5 minutes long and lost it's way as length went by, originally called Just A Little Blues but infact was based on Bo Diddley, so i made it shorter and more straight to the point blues/rock jam.\n\nEarly Morning Monday Blues\n\nThis track comes in many different shapes, sizes and form but this instrumental is almost the original offering i first made, just a few tweaks here and there for this Rock 'N Roll based Jam.. \n\nPiano Concerto No.1 2014\n\nThe 2014 edition of this song based on the sound of the J. Geils Band, just picture Seth Justman playing all the Keyboard Styles and lose yourself amongst it.\n\nJust A Little Country\n\nJust like, Just A Little Blues, this track of instrumental was made the same day, it's the only Country flavoured track i've ever created, this version has a drum track added and a slightly different beginning.\n\nTimmys Jam\n\nWho the heck is Timmy? Timmy is someone i made up called Timmy Two Tables, sounds more like a mobster than anything else of someone eating 2 plates of food from two tables lol, anyway this is the filler as i call it and it's a straight up Guitar Rock jam which in it's day was actually a techno/dubstep type instrumental but i removed most of that and some still is evident.\n\nI'm Lost, I'm Lonely' I Just Wanna Go Home.\n\nSad, alone, forgotten, hungry, just picture that as you listen along, sounds based on the 1980s for this little ditty of a instrumental.\n\n\nThere you have it for Xerovy I\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Mp3 V0 taken from 24/96 offerings and all come to -1db below Clipping. All contain their own Song Art plus Album Cover or should i say EP cover\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ No Flac for these tracks\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Will it ever be released as a CD, well i know nothing how to make one or get one done, so that's that.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Xerovy II ? ......Some day\n\nJerome McJerome.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d497ebe9ce2d727f0277faec628519995fb1358","amp;dn":"Xerovy+I+-+The+Xerovy+Express+-+2014+%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d497ebe9ce2d727f0277faec628519995fb1358","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,73,126,190,156,226,215,39,240,39,127,174,198,40,81,153,149,251,19,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
