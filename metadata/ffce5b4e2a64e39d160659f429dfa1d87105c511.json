Ripped by Mens Rea\n\nIn this Maya 2013 tutorial Digital Tutors  will help you develop a strong understanding of Maya's core features, as we take you through every single step of creating a short project in Maya. We will start by discussing the foundational skills and vocabulary that will be essential as you begin your Maya learning. \n\nFrom there we will move directly into modeling, where we will begin building the vehicle that will be used for the duration of this course. Once the vehicle is built we will move into texturing, rigging, animation, dynamics, and we will finish up with the lighting and rendering of our final animation.\n\nThis is a comprehensive course for Maya Beginners. I have most of the courses of Digital Tutors. Including stereoscopic 3D, Maya Transforming Robot volume 1-10 and Enhancing Rigs with Maya Muscle. If you want the torrents, Please comment and PM me.
