In this book, Michael Hugos provides compelling case studies that demonstrate how game mechanics enable companies to respond quickly to challenges in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s real-time economy.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not about giving workers a smiley face for producing more widgets. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll discover how game mechanicsÃ¢â‚¬â€particularly popular multiplayer video gamesÃ¢â‚¬â€provide field-tested best practices for engaging workers in creative and complex activities.
