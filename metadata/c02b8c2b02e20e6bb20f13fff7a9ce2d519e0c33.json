This song features on Libera's Japanese only 'mini-EP' CD release (the CD has a duration of 30 minutes, contains eight tracks and &quot;Song of Life&quot; is the only new song).\n\nThe music was written by Japanese composer Takatsugu Muramatsu, the words written by Robert Prizeman (who also did the arrangement) and the extraordinary solo on the recorded track was performed by Ralph Skan. Four seconds into the song, you hear a few single notes on a piano and then the single ethereal voice of James Mordaunt, followed by Ralph's solo in the opening verse. Light percussion, accompaniment, and certainly not least, the other boys join right before the chorus. Three minutes and twenty two seconds of truly magnificent Angel Voices!\n\n&quot;We shall never be alone\nas we link our hearts in one,\nJoining voices from above\nall in the miracle of life.\nThrough the ages we will grow\nonly time will ever know,\nas our voices magnify\nall in the miracle of life.\nLove plays along in our lives yet to come\nas we join in the song of life.&quot;\n\nI am sharing this because:\n\n  1. it's Libera!\n\n  2. it's a &quot;Japanese only 'mini-EP' CD release&quot;\n(SOURCE: http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B004N9TEE2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=libera20-22&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=7399&amp;creativeASIN=B004N9TEE2)\n\n  -- s4sharing\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c02b8c2b02e20e6bb20f13fff7a9ce2d519e0c33","amp;dn":"Libera+-+Song+of+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c02b8c2b02e20e6bb20f13fff7a9ce2d519e0c33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,43,140,43,2,226,14,107,178,15,19,255,247,169,206,45,81,158,12,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
