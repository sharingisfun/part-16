Then she meets bad boy Kai and gets the kiss that rocks her world.\n\nLiterally.\n\nThis breath stealing lip lock reawakens SophieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true identity: Persephone, Goddess of Spring. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s key to saving humanity in the war between the Underworld and Olympus, target numero uno of Hades and Zeus, and totally screwed.\n\nPlus thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also the little issue that SophieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last memory as Persephone was just before someone tried to murder her.\n\nBig picture: master her powers, get her memories back, defeat PersephoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s would be assassin, and save the world. Also, sneak into the Underworld to retrieve stolen property, battle the minions of Hades and Zeus, outwit psycho nymphs, slay a dragon, rescue a classmate, keep from getting her butt expelled from the one place designed to keep her safe Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and stop kissing Kai, Prince of the Underworld.\n\nMy Ex From Hell is a romantic comedy/Greek mythology smackdown. Romeo and Juliet had it easy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c03b2006ec27b4abac101732509b2680ba516c7e","amp;dn":"my+ex+from+hell%2C+Tellulah+Darling+%5Bdovah%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c03b2006ec27b4abac101732509b2680ba516c7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,59,32,6,236,39,180,171,172,16,23,50,80,155,38,128,186,81,108,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
