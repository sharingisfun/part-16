Pomogailo, G.I. Dzhardimalieva (Springer, 2014).pdf\r\n\r\nThe book is devoted to novel nanostructured materials and nanotechnology. A comprehensive analysis of the condensing methods of preparation of novel nanostructured materials is given. The methodology of power-consuming preparation of nanostructured materials is discussed, including thermolysis, photo- and radiolytic, electrochemical and mechanochemical methods. The peculiarities of chemical transformations in organic and inorganic matrices are compared. Special attention is given to kinetics and mechanism of the formation of nanocomposites. The structure and properties of such nanostructured materials are analysed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13204316386e93fe22567b668b5a5702ae8ad1f5","amp;dn":"Nanostructured+Materials+Preparation+via+Condensation+Ways","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13204316386e93fe22567b668b5a5702ae8ad1f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,32,67,22,56,110,147,254,34,86,123,102,139,90,87,2,174,138,209,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
