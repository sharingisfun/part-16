For many centuries, international relations between Medieval Japan, Korea and China were carried out by means of the 'inseparable trinity' of war, trade and piracy. Much has been written about the first two means of interaction. The third element, which combined the other two in a violent blend of free enterprise, is the subject of this original and exciting book. It is written by Stephen Turnbull, who has visited all three countries in search of the elusive pirates of the Far East.\n\n\n# Paperback: 64 pages\n# Publisher: Osprey Publishing; First American Edition edition (November 20, 2007)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1846031745\n# ISBN-13: 978-1846031748","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc0b1aca67c6e55869119b4d1928b6338abcd0f2","amp;dn":"Pirate+of+the+Far+East%3A+811-1639+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc0b1aca67c6e55869119b4d1928b6338abcd0f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,11,26,202,103,198,229,88,105,17,155,77,25,40,182,51,138,188,208,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
