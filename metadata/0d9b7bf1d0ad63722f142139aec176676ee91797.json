If few recognize that distinction, then it's because the Brothers Four were also part of a largely forgotten chapter in the history of folk music in America.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-brothers-four-p1930/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-brothers-four-p1930/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Bruce Eder):\n\nA decent 12-song compilation of the group's singles, several of which, including &quot;My Tani&quot; and &quot;Frogg,&quot; were never on their individual albums. The mix of tempos and sources encompasses everything from the two moody singles &quot;Greenfields&quot; and &quot;The Green Leaves of Summer&quot; to playful songs such as &quot;Frogg,&quot; gospel material (&quot;Nobody Knows&quot;), and robust, stomping pieces (&quot;I Am a Roving Gambler,&quot; &quot;Nine Pound Hammer&quot;). The sound is decent, but there's no annotation on this low-priced CD, a straight conversion of a 1967 album.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r95985&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r95985&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000024RA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000024RA&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
