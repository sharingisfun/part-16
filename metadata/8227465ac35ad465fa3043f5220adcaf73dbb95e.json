Other than keeping his parents employed, however, Mr. Black's BLACK BOX has done \nnothing for 11-year-old Toe Thompson, who just wants to make a few friends...until a mysterious rainbow-colored rock falls from the \nsky, hits him in the head and changes everything. The Rainbow Rock does Mr. Black's BLACK BOX one better: it grants wishes to anyone \nwho holds it. Before long, wishes-gone-wrong have left the neighborhood swarming with tiny spaceships, crocodile armies, giant \nboogers...and outrageous magical mayhem around every corner. But it's not until the grown-ups get their hands on the Rock that the \ntrouble really starts. Now Toe and his newfound friends must join forces to save their town from itself, discovering along the way \nthat what you wish for is not always what you want.\nEleven-year-old Toe Thompson is the designated punching bag for the bullies of the suburban community of Black Falls, where his \nand everyone else's parents work for Black Box Industries, makers of the do-it-all gadget that's sweeping the nation. But during \na freak storm, a mysterious Rainbow Rock, which grants wishes to anyone who finds it, falls from the sky. Suddenly, the neighborhood \nthat Toe already thinks is weird is about to get a lot weirder. As the Rainbow Rock ricochets around the town - from kid to kid and \nparent to parent - wishes-come-true quickly turn the neighborhood upside down in a wild rampage of everything from tiny aliens to \ngiant boogers. From Robert Rodriguez, director of &quot;Spy Kids,&quot; comes a magical fantasy adventure told through a series of shorts that \neach brings to life the sometimes wonderful, often terrible, and totally out-of-control wishes that become far more than Toe and his \nneighbors ever imagined.\n\n \nJimmy Bennett ...
