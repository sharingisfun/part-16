Released in January 1977, it is a concept album that provides a scathing critique of the social-political conditions of 1970s Britain and presents a marked change from their earlier work.\n\nAnimals was recorded at the band's studio, Britannia Row, in London. Production of the album was punctuated by the early signs of discord that several years later would culminate in keyboardist Richard Wright leaving the band. The album's cover image, a pig floating between two chimneys on Battersea Power Station, was designed by bassist and writer Roger Waters, and produced by long-time collaborator Hipgnosis.\n\nThe album was released to mixed reviews in the UK, where it reached #2. It was also a success in the US, reaching #3 on the Billboard album charts. Although it scored on the American charts for only six months, steady sales have resulted in the album being certified four times platinum by the RIAA.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nSide one\n\n      1.
