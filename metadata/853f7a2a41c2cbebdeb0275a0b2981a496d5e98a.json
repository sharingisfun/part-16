The filming took place all across the United States, Holland and Germany. &quot;Unauthorized Access&quot; looks at the personalities behind the computers screens and aims to separate the media hype of the 'outlaw hacker' from the reality.&quot;\n\nThis is a well dated video about the Hacker/Cracker communty.
