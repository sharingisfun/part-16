DTS track (if encore wasnt so dumb)\n4. better Q sync and subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3a104b88ee3b54c6afbc9a0f9cc33fbf4e6b88b","amp;dn":"Wizard+of+Oz+To+Pink+Floyd+Version+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3a104b88ee3b54c6afbc9a0f9cc33fbf4e6b88b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,161,4,184,142,227,181,76,106,251,201,160,249,204,51,251,244,230,184,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
