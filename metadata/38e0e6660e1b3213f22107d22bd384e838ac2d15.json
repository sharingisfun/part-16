The House on the Corner 2:31\n\n\n\nThis venerable band from Donegal presents its newest recording. Shifting somewhat away from its Narada-label leanings of a decade back into New Age-inflected stylings, this Compass Records release offers a more traditional delivery of tunes, reliable in their familiar conjuring of their Northwestern Irish heritage. At its best, this recalls their standout albums originally released in America on the Green Linnet label.\n\n\n\nThis is also the first of their many albums since they began around thirty years ago to feature an Irish-language title. It's taken from a place near vocalist-fiddler MairÃƒÂ©ad NÃƒÂ­ Mhaonaigh's home. She explains it as a mistranslation of &quot;heavenly&quot; glen, in fact, but that so many legends have sprung up to account for its more devilish connotation that it's been kept in its darker emanation. The band is photographed by Edain O'Donnell, or Photoshopped, among the technicolor of that glen, in a nod to the imagination which improves upon nature. This sly nod to enchantment and misdirection in the singer's native tongue represents a clever turn for this ensemble back to the roots music it plays best.\n\n\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/25/altan/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/25/altan/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38e0e6660e1b3213f22107d22bd384e838ac2d15","amp;dn":"Altan...Gleann+Nimhe+-+the+Poison+Glen%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38e0e6660e1b3213f22107d22bd384e838ac2d15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,224,230,102,14,27,50,19,242,33,7,210,43,211,132,232,56,172,45,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
