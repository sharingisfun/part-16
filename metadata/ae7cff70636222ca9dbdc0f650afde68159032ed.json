G. Wodehouse, being one of Wodehouse's best-loved characters. The P in his surname is silent ('as in pshrimp' in his own words) and was added by himself, in order to distinguish him from other Smiths. A member of the Drones Club, this monocle-sporting Old Etonian is something of a dandy, a fluent and witty speaker, and has a remarkable ability to pass through the most amazing adventures unruffled.\n\nThis collection contains all 4 novels:\n\nMike and Psmith (1953) [Originally published in 1909 as 'The Lost Lambs' in the novel 'Mike']\nPsmith in the City (1910)\nPsmith, Journalist (1915)\nLeave it to Psmith (1923)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae7cff70636222ca9dbdc0f650afde68159032ed","amp;dn":"P.+G.+Wodehouse+-+The+Psmith+Collection+%284+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae7cff70636222ca9dbdc0f650afde68159032ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,124,255,112,99,98,34,202,157,189,192,246,80,175,222,104,21,144,50,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
