A natural meeting point between Peter, BjÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¶rn and John's Young Folks, the Cure's Love Cats and Feist's 1234, it sounds calculatedly quirky, and its overbearing sweetness sours its charms. All too often on Does You Inspire You, this excess is a blight. Too much gloss is applied to Don't Give a Damn's country, and Home Alone's 80s drama becomes screechy tragedy. Still, in the record's sharper corners lurks a brilliant band, and a wonderful vocalist in Caroline Polachek. The sexy, slinky punk of Garbage, the John Barry balladry of Deer Hunt, and Evident Utensil - the massive pop single the Au Pairs never made - all bristle with power. They also show the magic Chairlift can make when they don't try too hard.\n\nSpin.com review:\nIn 2007, Chairlift moved from Colorado to Brooklyn to pursue a strangely common 21st-century dream -- to create a thoroughly modern indie-pop album inspired by '80s synth-goth kitsch. The result is the trio's startlingly impressive debut: astute, melodic evocations of plinky new wave (&quot;Bruises,&quot; &quot;Evident Utensil&quot;) and the Cocteau Twins' smeary dreams (&quot;Planet Health&quot;) that achieve a timeless emotional resonance. The lyrics can be ungainly (&quot;The most evident utensil is none other than a pencil&quot;? Really?), but when Caroline Polachek's exquisite vocals pierce the fog belt of keyboards and rumbling bass on &quot;Home Alone&quot; and &quot;Make Your Mind Up,&quot; the future starts to come into focus.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cdec559c06e4a34d8725f9937e221a061fdfd46","amp;dn":"Chairlift+-+Does+You+Inspire+You+%28Reissue+-+2009%29+%5BLossless%2FFLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cdec559c06e4a34d8725f9937e221a061fdfd46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,222,197,89,192,110,74,52,216,114,95,153,55,226,33,160,97,253,253,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
