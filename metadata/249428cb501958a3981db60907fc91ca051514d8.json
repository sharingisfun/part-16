He travels around the country as he explores the United Kingdom's remarkable past, from the perspective of ordinary people. It's wide-ranging, beautifully filmed and a bit sentimental, but also hugely informative and full of good humour. Nobody does this sort of thing better.\n\n\n\n\n2)  Tribes to Nations \nMichael Wood continues his history of Britain, exploring how the nations' individual identities emerged following the Dark Ages. He travels to Old Deer in Aberdeenshire, Dalriada kingdom in Co Antrim and Sedgefield in Norfolk, where community projects are helping the locals find a few clues to their past. He also recounts the arrival of the Vikings, and the impact made by the Norse invaders, with people from Ireland, the Wirral, Govan and York.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img69/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img69/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img100/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img100/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img197/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img197/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img811/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img811/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img88/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img88/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img13/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img13/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img222/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img222/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img690/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img690/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img12/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img12/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1562 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 8\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_British_Story:_A_People%27s_History_%28TV_series%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_British_Story:_A_People%27s_History_%28TV_series%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:249428cb501958a3981db60907fc91ca051514d8","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Great+British+Story+A+People+History+Season+1+2of8+Tribe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"249428cb501958a3981db60907fc91ca051514d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,148,40,203,80,25,88,163,152,29,182,9,7,252,145,202,5,21,20,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
