Rising Sun for Xbox, PS2, and GameCube, stars Marine Corporal Joseph Griffin on a mission to stop Japanese forces from taking control of the Pacific Theatre. Major battles including the infamous Pearl Harbor attack have been recreated with intense realism. Ten heroic levels are spread across five major historic WWII missions.
