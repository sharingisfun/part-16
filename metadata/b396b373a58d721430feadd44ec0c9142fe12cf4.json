Though much of this debut is about alcohol, Mexico, and girls (topics that the band later revisited on 1997's The Bottle &amp; Fresh Horses, albeit with a stronger southwestern influence), the album also sports a sense of humor and lack of pretension that helped make the Refreshments minor stars. Listening to &quot;Girly&quot; or &quot;Banditos,&quot; the album's flagship single, is like kicking back with a college bud and a brew: summery, smirky, and somewhat yearning. The irreverence in the Refreshments' lyrics makes all the difference between them and other increasingly self-serious bands in the same vein. All the anguished grunge and post-grunge posing got old fast -- and with clever lyrics, solidly melodic guitar work, and Roger Clyne's marketable voice, the Refreshments kept fun alive on the alternative scene throughout the decade's latter half.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b396b373a58d721430feadd44ec0c9142fe12cf4","amp;dn":"The+Refreshments+-+Fizzy+Fuzzy+Big+%26amp%3B+Buzzy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b396b373a58d721430feadd44ec0c9142fe12cf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,150,179,115,165,141,114,20,48,254,173,212,78,192,201,20,47,225,44,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
