The series was written by Jim Starlin and penciled by Ron Lim, Ian Laughlin, Al Milgrom, Jack Morelli and Christie Scheele.  The storyline is a direct sequel to the Infinity Gauntlet crossover.\n\nWhen hero Adam Warlock takes possession of the artifact known as the Infinity Gauntlet, he expels the good and evil aspects of his being to become a totally logical being, who can therefore use the Gauntlet wisely.  This act recreates his evil persona, and old foe The Magus, who desires universal conquest and revenge against Warlock and the Titan Thanos.  The Magus collects five cosmic containment units (another name for the Cosmic Cubes,) and with the power gained, incapacitates the cosmic entity Eternity; creates an interdimensional realm and an army of doppelgÃƒÂ¤ngers - evil mirror images of Earth's superheroes.\n\nThe story climaxes at the Magus' base:  a group of heroes free those who were replaced by doppelgÃƒÂ¤ngers; cosmic adventurer Quasar arrives with the Ultimate Nullifier , and villains Kang, The Conqueror and Doctor Doom appear, hoping to harness the source of the powerful energies detected.\n\nThe heroes return to Earth and the final page of the last issue reveals that the containment units have been stolen by Warlock's good persona, the Goddess.  Eternity thereafter declares that the Gems on The Gauntlet will never be able to be used again as a single unit, no matter what future crisis befalls the universe.\n\n\nEnjoy, and please seed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa5cefb297344589158b14bfe7359fb126fd6dd2","amp;dn":"The+Infinity+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa5cefb297344589158b14bfe7359fb126fd6dd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,92,239,178,151,52,69,137,21,139,20,191,231,53,159,177,38,253,109,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
