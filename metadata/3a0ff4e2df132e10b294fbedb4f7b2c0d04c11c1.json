When his doted, equally devoted oldest son Aaron is startled, Clark, who was chopping firewood, accidentally hits his leg with an ax. He had bled to death if wandering youngster Nate hadn't found them, brought them home and taken care of the farm, way above the kids' ability. Gratefull Clark offers Nate an indefinite farmhand job, all the more interesting as Missy and he take to each-other, but she's also courted by classy railroad surveyor. Once recovered, Clark works out Nate is really Willie, the son of local grump Zeke, who left years ago after his kid brother Mattie's tragical death. Decision time arrives for both families.
