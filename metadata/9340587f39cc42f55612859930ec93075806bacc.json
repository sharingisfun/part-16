The river\n      flows past one of the most impressive Roman forts in northern\n      Britain, and over three days the archaeologists cast their net\n      far and wide investigating the buildings, roads and structures\n      around this strategic crossing. However, the big challenge is\n      working out what was going on in the middle of the river, where\n      most of the finds came from, and that means a variety of Time\n      Team's finest squeezing into wetsuits and braving the fast\n      flowing river Tees.\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?
