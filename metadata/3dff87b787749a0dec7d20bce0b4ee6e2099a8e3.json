Shore plays Bud Macintosh, a Tucson, Arizona, slacker and junior college student. Bud and his best pal Doyle Johnson (Stephen Baldwin), have just suffered the humiliation of being dumped by their girlfriends when they stumble into what they think is a new mall. However, the facility is a scientific research laboratory known as a bio-dome, a self-sustaining habitat in which five scientists, led by Dr. Noah Faulkner (William Atherton), are to conduct experiments. The catch is that the bio-dome has just been sealed for a year and cannot be opened. As their twelve months pass, Bud and Doyle with their amorous behavior and toilet humor are a constant source of irritation and annoyance to the legitimate residents, but they find romance and eventually get an unexpected chance to prove themselves. \n\nRipped with DVD Decrypter and Autogk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dff87b787749a0dec7d20bce0b4ee6e2099a8e3","amp;dn":"Bio-Dome%281996%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dff87b787749a0dec7d20bce0b4ee6e2099a8e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,255,135,183,135,116,154,13,236,125,32,188,224,180,238,110,32,153,168,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
