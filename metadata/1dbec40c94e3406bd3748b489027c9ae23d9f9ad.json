On four selections he is backed by a big band arranged by Ernie Wilkins (Rollins's appearances with big bands have been quite rare through the years) including Gershwin's &quot;Who Cares?&quot; \n\nThe flip side showcases the great tenor in a trio with bassist Henry Grimes and drummer Charles Wright including &quot;Manhattan,&quot; one of the very few jazz versions of &quot;If You Were the Only Girl in the World&quot; and a brilliant unaccompanied performance of a song often associated with his idol Coleman Hawkins, &quot;Body and Soul.&quot; Rollins excels in both of these settings, making this an easily recommended set\n\n\n\n01 Who Cares?
