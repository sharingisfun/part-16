These can be played using CCCP (cccp-project.net).\n\n---\n\nFrom the &quot;Complete First Season&quot; R1 NTSC DVDs (The Lost Episode is from the Tokyo DVD). High size/low CRF to avoid exacerbating the compression on the discs. Any aliasing/blocking/etc is most likely due to the source video. 576p because I think it benefits from a slight upscale.\n\n---\n\nVideo: 10-bit x264 (766/768x576), ~1816-3019kbps\nAudio: Untouched 2.0 AC3, 192kbps, English only\nSubs: None\n\n---\n\nThe other seasons will come as soon as I can get the DVDs. If you have complete ISOs for season 2, 4, or 5, let me know.\nI won't be doing season 3 or the movie because those have great 8-bit HD versions which you can find here as well.\n\n\nIf you want English/French/Spanish subtitles, the French/Spanish dubs, or any of the special features, let me know and I'll upload those for you separately.\n\nSCREENS:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eafe8ddeebb4cd526df0e066a01ba7d15ab465ee","amp;dn":"Teen+Titans+Season+1+%5B10-bit+x264+AC3%5D%5B576p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eafe8ddeebb4cd526df0e066a01ba7d15ab465ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,254,141,222,235,180,205,82,109,240,224,102,160,27,167,209,90,180,101,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
