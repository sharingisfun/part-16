For this reason, the music Glass has written to films with no script are among his greatest achievements. These include the famous &quot;Qatsi trio&quot; (Koyannisqatsi, Powaqqatsi, Naqoyqatsi) and Anima Mundi made with Godfrey Reggio. In these films, the image and music blend seamlessly, due to intense collaboration between composer and director. But in addition, the music succeeds by itself as an orchestral suite in the way a soundtrack cannot do. Animals in Love is a worthy addition to that genre. Even without seeing the movie, the titles of the tracks are all one needs to let the music paint the picture.&quot;\nMarvin Cohodas\n\n---------------- Tracks --------------\n01 Swans Take Flight\n02 The Bath\n03 The Gaze, the Scents\n04 The Battle\n05 Ballet of the Birds\n06 The Birth of the Fawn\n07 The Peacock and the Japanese Cranes\n08 The Grebe's Race on Water\n09 The Kangaroos\n10 From Insects to Whales\n11 The Happy Couples\n12 The Orangutans and the Small Ducks\n13 From Gazelles to Kangaroos\n14 The Return of the Animals\n15 The Swans Return/End Title\n\nmuzik62","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46f31fbe91d745089970f13d99b670467d96e427","amp;dn":"Philip+Glass+Les+Animaux+Amoureux+OST-2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46f31fbe91d745089970f13d99b670467d96e427","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,243,31,190,145,215,69,8,153,112,241,61,153,182,112,70,125,150,228,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
