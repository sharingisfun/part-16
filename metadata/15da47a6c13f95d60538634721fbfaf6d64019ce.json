Fresh on the heels of his Folsom Prison album, Cash reveals the dark intensity and raw talent that made him a country music star and cultural icon. Director Robert Elfstrom got closer than any other filmmaker to Cash, who is seen performing with his new bride June Carter Cash, in a rare duet with Bob Dylan, and behind the scenes with friends, family and aspiring young musicians. Johnny Cash: The Man, His World, His Music paints an unforgettable portrait that endures beyond the singer's 2003 death.\n\nFormat : AVI\nLength : 699 MiB for 1h 21mn 48s 742ms\nCodec : XviD\nSource : PDTV\n\nVideo #0 : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 044 Kbps\nAspect : 528 x 384 (1.375) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0 : MPEG Audio at 136 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15da47a6c13f95d60538634721fbfaf6d64019ce","amp;dn":"PBS+POV-Johnny+Cash%3AThe+Man%2CHis+World%2CHis+Music.%282008%29.PDTV.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15da47a6c13f95d60538634721fbfaf6d64019ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,218,71,166,193,63,149,214,5,56,99,71,33,251,250,246,214,64,25,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
