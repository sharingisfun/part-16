Browsers iterate at a remarkable pace. Faced with this volatile landscape we can either struggle for control or we can embrace the inherent flexibility of the web.\nResponsive design is not just another technique--it is the beginning of the maturation of a medium and a fundamental shift in the way we think about the web.\nImplementing Responsive Design is a discussion about how this affects the way we design, build, and think about our sites. Readers will learn how to:\n\n    * Build responsive sites using a combination of fluid layouts, media queries and fluid media\n    * Adopt a responsive workflow from the very start of a project\n    * Enhance content for different devices\n    * Use feature-detection and server-side enhancement to provide a richer experience\n\n\n\n# Paperback: 288 pages\n# Publisher: New Riders; 1 edition (August 10, 2012)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0321821688\n# ISBN-13: 978-0321821683","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b58a6c591afe0e4ba1bd56c3c9eba8c32bdeab8f","amp;dn":"Implementing+Responsive+Design+%5BWebsite+Deign%5D+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b58a6c591afe0e4ba1bd56c3c9eba8c32bdeab8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,138,108,89,26,254,14,75,161,189,86,195,201,235,168,195,43,222,171,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
