Now, years later,\nwe can agree that Aly &amp; Fila are one of the most respected and appreciated\ntrance acts in the world, even though their music doesn't limit itself to just\none genre. Following their recent Chill Out album which saw themselves\nreworking their own classics into a more chilled, downtempo style, the Cairo\nbased combo are back doing what they do best, impressing trance fans around\nthe world with their brand of uplifting music. Now releasing the third\ninstalment of their legendary 'Future Sound Of Egypt' series, Aly &amp; Fila\ndemonstrate to a global audience yet again that they are a force to be\nreckoned with.
