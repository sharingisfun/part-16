The tight yet swinging arrangements are full of subtle surprises and serve as a perfect format for the players, particularly Green. Highlights include Thad Jones' &quot;Don't Get Sassy,&quot; Oscar Peterson's &quot;Kelly's Blues,&quot; &quot;Tanga,&quot; &quot;Brown's New Blues,&quot; and a three-song Duke Ellington medley. Recommended.
