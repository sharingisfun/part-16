She has released four full albums and is best known for her songs Don't Walk Away (a Hot 100 hit in the United States in 1988), I've Got To Go Now, a Top 5 hit in Australia in 1991, and the Emmy-winning Because You're Beautiful (released as a single in 2004, and featured on her 2008 album Keep The Faith).\n\nThis singer may prove interesting to those who listen to Alanis Morissette, Tori Amos, Kate Bush, Bjork, Joanna Newsom and finally, Marianne Faithfull.\nChild's 1994 album The Woman's Boat may prove to be of particular interest to fans of concept albums such as Kate Bush's Hounds of Love and Ariel.\n\n\nUnion (1988) 320 kbps\n\n1.
