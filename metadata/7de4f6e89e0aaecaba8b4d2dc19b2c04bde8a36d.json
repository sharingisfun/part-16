Ever practical, she accepts a position as a governess to a wealthy Scottish merchant, determined to escape London and the gossip of the ton. Her hopes for a quiet, new life are dashed when she arrives at the dark, desolate castle in the wilds of Scotland and meets her mysterious new employerÃ¢â‚¬â€a darkly handsome man Harriet finds both intimidating and intriguing.\n\nPowerful, implacable and infuriatingly secretive, &quot;Mr. Wainwright&quot; is no Scottish merchant, but rather a runaway English lord. Once a rake who savored the indolent life of a reckless nobleman, Nathaniel Bennett must now protect three orphaned children and his own legacy from a conniving relative. And while the distraction of a sharp-tongued governess is the last thing he needs, he can think of little else but sweeping her into his arms...and off to his bed.\n\nAs danger and deceit ally them in a perilous adventure, Harriet will soon uncover Nathaniel's deepest secretsÃ¢â‚¬â€and her own deepest desires.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7de4f6e89e0aaecaba8b4d2dc19b2c04bde8a36d","amp;dn":"To+Tempt+a+Rogue+by+Adrienne+Basso+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7de4f6e89e0aaecaba8b4d2dc19b2c04bde8a36d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,228,246,232,158,10,174,202,186,139,77,45,193,155,44,4,189,232,163,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
