Rosario was born in Chicago to parents of Puerto Rican background. Her father is a pastor and she sang in his church as a child. Her professional career began as a member of Fred Hammond's Radical for Christ. Hammond helped her launch a solo career in 2002 with her debut album More, More, More. In 2003, Rosario was diagnosed with nodules on her vocal folds, and took an extended hiatus to treat the condition. She released a follow-up effort in 2005 and a third in 2007.\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - July 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:041ef14ce0e68ef0e36fbcb9165069898083a3e4","amp;dn":"Joann+Rosario+Discography+2002-2008+%284+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"041ef14ce0e68ef0e36fbcb9165069898083a3e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,30,241,76,224,230,142,240,227,111,188,185,22,80,105,137,128,131,163,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
