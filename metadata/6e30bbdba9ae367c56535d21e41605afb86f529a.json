You are expected to have experience with basic Blender operations.\r\n\r\nWhat You Will Learn\r\nReacquaint yourself with Blender's modeling toolset\r\nPractice fundamental skills that are applicable to a range of modeling projects\r\nKnow when and where to use various types of geometry-something that saves time in one instance will pose significant problems in another\r\nThink ahead and plan your project out to significantly improve both quality and efficiency\r\nCreate models for freestyle use\r\nOvercome challenging modeling problems\r\nCreate customized game models that can easily be exported to other formats. This is one of the most popular uses of Blender, and the results can be incorporated into game design!\r\nGet comfortable with the start-to-finish process to create any type of hard surface model\r\nIn Detail\r\nBlender 3D is one of the top pieces of 3D animation software. Machine modeling is an essential aspect of war games, space games, racing games, and animated action films. As the Blender software grows more powerful and popular, there is a demand to take your modeling skills to the next level. This book will cover all the topics you need to create professional models and renders.\r\n\r\nThis book will help you develop a comprehensive skill set that covers the key aspects of mechanical modeling. Through this book, you will create many types of projects, including a pistol, spacecraft, robot, and a racer. We start by making a Sci-fi pistol, creating its basic shape and adding details to it. Moving on, you'll discover modeling techniques for larger objects such as a space craft and take a look at how different techniques are required for freestyle modeling.\r\n\r\nAfter this, we'll create the basic shapes for the robot and combine the meshes to create unified objects. We'll assign materials and explore the various options for freestyle rendering. We'll discuss techniques to build low-poly models, create a low-poly racer, and explain how they differ from the high poly models we created previously.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this book, you will have mastered a workflow that you will be able to apply to your own creations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenjoy...\r\n\r\nYOURs INsincerely...\r\n \r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                                         .:.Shailab.:.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t         https://thepiratebay.la/user/shailab/\r\n\r\n      \t\t\t\t   https://kat.cr/user/shailab/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e30bbdba9ae367c56535d21e41605afb86f529a","amp;dn":"Blender+3D+Incredible+Machine+Christopher+Kuhn+1785282018Shailab","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e30bbdba9ae367c56535d21e41605afb86f529a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,48,187,219,169,174,54,124,86,83,93,33,228,22,5,175,184,111,82,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
