The source is an original two-channel Capitol FDS recording circa 1956. I have never heard performances of Britten's &quot;Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra&quot; (this is the version without narrator) or Dohnanyi's &quot;Variations on a Nursery Tune,&quot; a set of playful variations on &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,&quot; played as well. The Concert Arts Orchestra was a pickup group featuring some of the best Hollywood studio musicians of the era. Felix Slatkin, the conductor, was concertmaster of the Twentieth Century Fox orchestra and also recorded pop albums with Sinatra and many others, in addition to conducting a number of light-classic LPs for Capitol Records in the 1950s. He's the father of noted conductor Leonard Slatkin, whom I believe is the little boy on the album's cover. Regrettable, there are a few minor dropouts in the first minute or so of &quot;Guide,&quot; the result of some inevitable breaks in the fragile magnetic tape over the last 60 years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f111c53d36af62390e339db89e92cfcbd2deb8c","amp;dn":"Young+Person%27s+Guide+to+the+Orchestra+-+Variations+on+a+Nursery+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f111c53d36af62390e339db89e92cfcbd2deb8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,17,28,83,211,106,246,35,144,227,57,219,137,233,44,252,189,45,235,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
