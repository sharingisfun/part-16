After an apocalyptic war between human and machines, the world is completely destroyed and without human life. The burlap doll 9 awakes without voice and finds a weird object in the middle of the debris that he brings with him. While walking through the ruins, 9 is attacked by a machine called Beast but he is saved by another doll called 2 that fixes his voice. 2 brings 9 to meet his hidden community, leaded by the coward 1. When 2 is captured by a machine, the newcomer 9 convinces the other dolls to go with him to rescue 2. However, 9 places the device that he found in a slot and activates a lethal machine called Brain. The burlap dolls are chased by Brain and despite the advices of 1 that they should hide, 9 organizes an attack to destroy Brain. Written by Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n. When 9 first comes to life, he finds himself in a post-apocalyptic world where all humans are gone, and it is only by chance that he discovers a small community of others like him taking refuge from fearsome machines that roam the earth intent on their extinction. Despite being the neophyte of the group, 9 convinces the others that hiding will do them no good. They must take the offensive if they are to survive, and they must discover why the machines want to destroy them in the first place. As they'll soon come to learn, the very future of civilization may depend on them.

Powered and enabled by the invention known as the Great Machine, the world's machines have turned on mankind and sparked social unrest, decimating the human population before being largely shut down. But as our world fell to pieces, a mission began to salvage the legacy of civilization; a group of small creations was given the spark of life by a scientist in the final days of humanity, and they continue to exist post-apocalypse. With their group so few, these &quot;stitchpunk&quot; creations must summon individual strengths well beyond their own proportions in order to outwit and fight against still-functioning machines, one of which is a marauding mechanized beast.\n\n\n\n\nGenres: Animation / Adventure / Drama / Fantasy / Sci-Fi\n\nRELEASE.NAME..: 9.2009.Blu-ray.DTS.1080p.x264.HDBRiSe.mkv\nRELEASE.DATE..: 2009-11-13\nRUNTiME.......: 1h 19mn\nSiZE..........: 7.96 GiB\nViDEO.CODEC...: x264\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\nBiTRATE.......: 12.6 Mbps\nRESOLUTiON....: 1920 x 1080\nAUDiO.........: English DTS 5.1  1510 Kbps\nSUBTiTLES.....: English,Romanian,Swedish,Greek,Norwegian,Portuguese,Polish,Spanish,Danish,Hungarian\n\nScreen:\nhttp://www.shareimage.ro/images/h0sw4lf00g684fw1elkq.jpg\nhttp://www.shareimage.ro/images/na5aajvzbohpkamer1j.jpg\n\n\nThis is for our true HD 1080p fans\nBe nice.
