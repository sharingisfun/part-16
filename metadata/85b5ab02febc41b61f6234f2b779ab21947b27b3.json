The game was released in North America on November 1, 2009, in Australia on November 5, 2009 and in Europe on November 6, 2009.\n\nRabbids Go Home is the fourth installment in the Rabbids sub-series of the Rayman series of video games and is the first stand-alone title in the sub-series. The game's plot centers on the efforts of the titular Rabbids to collect as many human objects as they can and create a huge pile high enough to reach the Moon, all the while avoiding the extermination attempts by the &quot;Verminators&quot;, who wish to gain back the stuff the Rabbids have stolen.\n\nThe game received generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised the game's humor, soundtrack and accessible gameplay, though some noted the game's low difficulty. The reviews for the Nintendo DS version were mixed.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/9/2009/11/500x_custom_1257542233881_BetterRabbids.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/9/2009/11/500x_custom_1257542233881_BetterRabbids.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.teamteabag.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/17098_normal-500x281.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.teamteabag.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/17098_normal-500x281.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85b5ab02febc41b61f6234f2b779ab21947b27b3","amp;dn":"Rabbits+Go+Home","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85b5ab02febc41b61f6234f2b779ab21947b27b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,181,171,2,254,188,65,182,31,98,52,242,183,121,171,33,148,123,39,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
