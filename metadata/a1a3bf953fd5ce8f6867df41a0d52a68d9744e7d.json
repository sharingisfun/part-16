Make a difference against a backdrop of towering California redwoods and crystal-clear rivers. Rent-free cabin included.\n\nWhen the recently widowed Melinda Monroe sees this ad she quickly decides that the remote mountain town of Virgin River might be the perfect place to escape her heartache, and to re-energize the nursing career she loves. But her high hopes are dashed within an hour of arriving: the cabin is a dump, the roads are treacherous and the local doctor wants nothing to do with her. Realizing sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s made a huge mistake, Mel decides to leave town the following morning.\n\nBut a tiny baby, abandoned on a front porch, changes her plans...and a former marine cements them into place.\n\nMelinda Monroe may have come to Virgin River looking for escape, but instead she finds her home.\n\n [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/zcQCsbZ.jpg[/IMG]\n[URL=http://imgur.com/c89B4V4][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/c89B4V4.gif[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=http://imgur.com/KHdCrwR][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/KHdCrwR.gif[/IMG][/URL]\n[URL=http://imgur.com/lfKaxMx][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/lfKaxMx.gif[/IMG][/URL","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1a3bf953fd5ce8f6867df41a0d52a68d9744e7d","amp;dn":"Robin+Carr+-+Virgin+River","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1a3bf953fd5ce8f6867df41a0d52a68d9744e7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,163,191,149,63,213,206,143,104,103,223,65,160,213,42,104,217,116,78,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
