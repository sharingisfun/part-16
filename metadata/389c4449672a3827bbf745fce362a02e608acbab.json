Parker was a highly influential jazz soloist and a leading figure in the development of bebop, a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, virtuosic technique and improvisation. Parker introduced revolutionary harmonic ideas including rapid passing chords, new variants of altered chords, and chord substitutions. His tone ranged from clean and penetrating to sweet and somber. Many Parker recordings demonstrate his virtuoso playing style and complex melodic lines, sometimes combining jazz with other musical genres, including blues, Latin, and classical. Parker acquired the nickname &quot;Yardbird&quot; early in his career and the shortened form, &quot;Bird&quot;, which continued to be used for the rest of his life, inspired the titles of a number of Parker compositions, such as &quot;Yardbird Suite&quot;, &quot;Ornithology&quot;, &quot;Bird Gets the Worm&quot;, and &quot;Bird of Paradise.&quot;...\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n1-  Why Do I Love You [Take 2]\n2-  Tico-Tico\n3-  My Little Suede Shoes\n4-  Un Poquito De Tu Amor\n5-  Estrellita [Take Six]\n6-  I'm in the Mood for Love\n7-  Begin the Beguine\n8-  Temptation\n9-  Easy to Love\n10- East of the Sun (And West of the Moon)\n11- I Didn't Know What Time It Was\n12- If I Should Lose You\n13- (You Came From) Out of Nowhere\n14- I'll Remember in April [Take 1]\n15- Autumn in New York\n16- Laura [Take 1]\n17- Ballade\n18- Lover Man (Oh, Where Can You Be?)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:389c4449672a3827bbf745fce362a02e608acbab","amp;dn":"Charlie+Parker+-+Gitanes+Jazz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"389c4449672a3827bbf745fce362a02e608acbab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,156,68,73,103,42,56,39,187,247,69,252,227,98,160,46,96,138,203,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
