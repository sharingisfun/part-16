Dr. John Morris studies geology, culture, and various creation theories to give a true picture of Earth history. This book explodes popular misconceptions about the age of the earth by exposing the shaky reasoning behind radiometric dating, making Morris's discussion of these fallacies alone worth the price of the book. The Young Earth will also help readers understand that fossils are dated to vast ages by calculating that the sil they are found in is millions of years oldÃ¢â‚¬â€a startling &quot;trade secret&quot; among evolutionists. An excellent teaching tool.\n\nTopics discussed:\n-What Do the Rocks Say?\n-What Does the Bible Say?\n-The Two Views Contrasted\n-Dating Methods\n-Radioisotope Dating\n-Human History and the Young Earth\n-Worldwide Physical Processes\n-Geologic Evidence for a Young Earth\n-What Do the Rocks Mean?\n\nAbout the author:\nJohn Morris, Ph.D., is president of the Institute for Creation Research in El Cajon, California and has a Ph.D. in geology from the University of Oklahoma.
