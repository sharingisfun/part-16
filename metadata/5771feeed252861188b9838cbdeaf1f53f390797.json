The band pioneered and popularized a subgenre of alternative music known as &quot;shoegazing&quot;, which critic Simon Reynolds called &quot;a departure from the traditional rock musculature of riff and powerchord, towards a new and private lexicon of sounds and effects.&quot;\nMy Bloody Valentine released its debut mini album, This Is Your Bloody Valentine, in 1985 on Tycoon Records with its original line-up: Dave Conway on vocals, Kevin Shields on guitar and bass, Colm Ãƒâ€œ CÃƒÂ­osÃƒÂ³ig on drums and Tina Durkin on keyboards. After the album failed to receive much attention, the band relocated to London. The band recruited bassist Debbie Googe after the album's release and this line-up released three further EPs: Geek! in 1985, The New Record by My Bloody Valentine in 1986 and Sunny Sundae Smile in 1987 on various independent labels. Following Conway's departure, vocalist and guitarist Bilinda Butcher joined in 1987 and the band released one further EP, Strawberry Wine, and one mini album, Ecstasy, on Lazy Records before signing to Creation Records in 1988.[4] During its time on Creation, My Bloody Valentine produced its most notable material, including their two full-length studio albums, Isn't Anything (1988) and Loveless (1991). Both albums, and their singles, were successful. Isn't Anything reached number 1 on the UK Indie Chart, Glider reached number 2, and Tremolo reached 1 on the UK Indie Chart. Loveless debuted on the UK Albums Chart at number 24, and its lead single &quot;Only Shallow&quot; charted at number 27 on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks. Loveless has since sold over 250,000 copies in the United States alone.\n\n\nAlbum List:\n\nCompilations\n(1989) My Bloody Valentine - Ecstasy And Wine\n(2012) My Bloody Valentine - EP's 1988-1991\n\nEPs\n(1988) My Bloody Valentine - You Made Me Realise\n(1990) My Bloody Valentine - Glider\n(1991) My Bloody Valentine - Tremolo\n\nMini Albums\n(1985) My Bloody Valentine - This Is Your Bloody Valentine\n\nSingles\n(1988) My Bloody Valentine - Feed Me With Your Kiss\n(1991) My Bloody Valentine - Only Shallow (CD Promo)\n\nStudio Albums\n(1988) My Bloody Valentine - Isn't Anything\n(1988) My Bloody Valentine - Isn't Anything [2012 Remastered Reissue]\n(1991) My Bloody Valentine - Loveless\n(1991) My Bloody Valentine - Loveless [2012 Remastered Reissue]\n(2013) My Bloody Valentine - m b v [Self-Released WEB]\n\n\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry:Ireland (Dublin)\nGenre:rock \nStyles:Alternative rock,shoegazing,noise pop,dream pop,indie pop\n\n\n\nMedia Report:\nSource : CD\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nBit rate : 987 ~ 735 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5771feeed252861188b9838cbdeaf1f53f390797","amp;dn":"My+Bloody+Valentine+%5BFLAC%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5771feeed252861188b9838cbdeaf1f53f390797","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,113,254,238,210,82,134,17,136,185,131,140,189,234,241,245,63,57,7,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
