He shows us a &quot;fuck her right in the pussy&quot; shout out video, a video of possibly the worst comic ever, one of a &quot;know it all&quot; in a courthouse, and Keith tells us about the first time he used a Taser. Ant gets into Rat's lack of a past, tells us how the conversation really goes down in the gaming community, and he examines using your real name versus being anonymous online. Ant introduces us to a TV show called &quot;Girlfriend Intervention&quot; as well as a new Snoop Dogg video and the double standards surrounding them, and then FINALLY, Beavis makes an appearance. He ends today by talking about a &quot;freak show&quot; on TLC and by braving a few more calls.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b29f44ae774d325807d3f10bd1c6bbe845586420","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-09-03","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b29f44ae774d325807d3f10bd1c6bbe845586420","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,159,68,174,119,77,50,88,7,211,241,11,209,198,187,232,69,88,100,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
