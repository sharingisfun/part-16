Sadly, Nicolette Larson never got the attention she deserved (except for the popular &quot;Lotta Love&quot; from her first LP). &quot;Radioland&quot; shows her vocals in top form, and her harmonies with Linda Ronstadt and Maureen McDonald are excellent. The musicianship is also outstanding, featuring members of the Doobie Brothers and Little Feat. Best of all, the recording is outstanding. I highly recommend both of these recordings for any fan of the late Ms. Larson.\n\nInformation Disc:\n\n? Artist:    Nicolette Larson\n? Title:     Radioland\n? Year:     1980\n?
