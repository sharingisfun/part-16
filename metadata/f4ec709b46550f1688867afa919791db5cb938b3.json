Thanks nos1\nAUDIO: OWN\n\nOk to clear up the readnfo part... we used this tag because we had to add 3mins 23secs of video off our cam release due to focus issues on this video. Right, this time round we have good line audio and also a new video source :) Now the video is cropped around the bottom and sides but not quite as much as the other cam video. Also this one has alot better picture Q then the one before. Audio... brand new line and pretty decent. We just had to sync it to our encode. Overall not too bad for a TS, some auto focus issues here and there but still watchable. Enjoy folks\n\ncredit IMAGiNE &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, IPTORRENTS, DEMONOID &amp; AHASHARE :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, Dibya9999, Treezluv2draw, pitic, FASAMOO, W1CK3D1NT3Z, GRIND3R, extremezone, MonsterTV, BLaZE, SAFCuk009, Fabreezy, MXMG, Hellb0y, iwanttobelieveinaj, velvetfog, mustaphanaru, greenbud1969 &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****\n\nSCREENSHOTS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/904/vlcsnap2011010507h57m24.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/904/vlcsnap2011010507h57m24.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/9626/vlcsnap2011010507h58m22.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/9626/vlcsnap2011010507h58m22.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/8527/vlcsnap2011010507h57m13.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/8527/vlcsnap2011010507h57m13.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDON'T THANK US...HELP SOMEONE IN NEED :)\n\nMAY YOU &amp; YOUR LOVED ONES ALWAYS BE BLESSED WITH LIGHT, LOVE, JOY, PEACE, GOOD HEALTH &amp; ABUNDANCE :)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1320261/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1320261/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4ec709b46550f1688867afa919791db5cb938b3","amp;dn":"Gullivers+Travel+TS+READNFO+XViD+V2+-+IMAGiNE%28new+source%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4ec709b46550f1688867afa919791db5cb938b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,236,112,155,70,85,15,22,136,134,122,250,145,151,145,219,92,185,56,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
