I had been working on it for years, and was (am!) very proud of it. Since Ive been doing this, I've learned a lot about how to fix tags and so forth, as well as significantly adding to it from various other torrents. The torrent gathered a lot of nice comments and some helpful suggestions.\n\nSince then, the size of the thing has increased hugely. Not only through many purchased albums and some rare finds at garage sales and old record stores, but through some other torrents that are often very badly seeded. I am retorrenting the whole thing now as a version 2. I want to thank all the other uploaders who have helped make this possible, and pass along to any reader that you can surely search for the original torrents if you don't want all the other accompaniments. I have normalized and corrected tags as far as I could, but these databases are faulty, and I am sure some mistakes remain. I have also converted all formats to mp3 for the iPod crowd and because FLAC sucks. Some of the purists are going to be pissy because I have reduced many 320 kbps recordings to 128 for the sake of saving size. Again, if you deeply care about bit rate you can find a lot of this collection in separate torrents at higher bit rates if you search individually, but they are usually badly seeded.\n\nThe torrent is quite large, and I am sorry to announce that the number of files forces me to make this a .RAR torrent, because THE PIRATE BAY will not allow the torrent in any other fashion.\n\nThe original version is still out there and quite well seeded if you want to start with something smaller, and I want to make a major plug for another recent torrent = HISTORY OF IRELAND IN SONG VERSION 3. A helluva lot of work went into that one.\n\nI've included a directory listing outside the .RAR portion, so you can see if this collection is worth your time. Here is the basic listing of the bands, keep in mind that many songs are in the MISC file since that many bands didn't have enough to merit their own file.\n\nAAA Misc (hundreds of assorted cuts &amp; Covers)\nAlex Beaton                                                \nAthen Rye                                                  \nBagpipes                                                   \nBattering Ram                                              \nBawdy Beggar Girls                                         \nBen Holmes                                                 \nBing Crosby                                                \nBlarney Lads                                               \nCarbon Leaf                                                \nCeltic Tenors                                              \nCeltic Woman                                               \nCharlie &amp; the Bhoys                                        \nChieftains                                                  \nChristy Moore                                              \nClancy Brothers                                            \nClannad                                                    \nCorries                                                    \nDanny Boy Album                                            \nDublin City Ramblers                                       \nDublin Cowboys                                             \nDublin Ramblers                                           \nDubliners                                                  \nEire Og                                                    \nForever Plaid                                              \nFrank Harte and Donal Lunny - 1798 The First Year           \nGaelic Storm                                               \nGeneric Irish Sing-along albums                            \nGreat Big Sea                                              \nIrish Celtic Punk (Flogging Molly, Dropkick, etc)                                         \nIrish Descendents                                          \nIrish Rovers                                               \nJoanie Madden - Songs of the Irish Whistle                  \nJohnny Logan and friends - The Irish Connection            \nJudy Collins                                               \nJuice O' The Barley                                        \nKing's Galliard                                            \nLoreena McKennitt                                          \nMary O'Hara - Songs Of Ireland                             \nNaughty Nymphs                                            \nOÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´ Riada Sa Gaiety                                         \nOrthodox Celts                                             \nPaddy Noonan                                               \nPlanxty                                                    \nPogues                                                     \nQuilty                                                     \nRoger Whittaker                                            \nSeamus Kennedy                                           \nSean O'Neill Band                                         \nSinead O'Connor                                            \nSongs Of Ireland 1-3                                      \nSpailpin                                            \nTears For Beers\nthe Tommy Makem Songbag                         \nThree Irish Tenors                         \nWolfe Tones\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abe0713894bcbb3c9d28d74816b316c988514197","amp;dn":"Irish+Celtic+Music+Collection+Version+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abe0713894bcbb3c9d28d74816b316c988514197","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,224,113,56,148,188,187,60,157,40,215,72,22,179,22,201,136,81,65,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
