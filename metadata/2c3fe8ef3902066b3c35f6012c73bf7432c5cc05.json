My name's Casey Kasem and the countdown doesn't stop until we get to the brand new number one.&quot;\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nHear Casey say, &quot;Introducing, at number 36, a new group and a new song. It's &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; by Lynyrd Skynyrd.\n\nA listener asks, &quot;Which has been the biggest hit so far in 1974?&quot; Casey lists the top three, the top two being about fond memories of the past!\n\nAnother listener wants to know what the first gold record was. Casey answers with two stories, the first is about the first record ever painted gold and given to Glen Miller by his record company (RCA in 1942), and then the first record certified gold by the RIAA to have sold a million copies (awarded to Perry Como in 1958).\n\nCasey reports there was a time when Billy &quot;Crash&quot; Craddock (at number 16 with &quot;Rub It In&quot;) was touted as &quot;the next Elvis.&quot; If only someone could have foreseen Billy Ray Cyrus and his &quot;Achy Breaky Heart&quot; was destined to become the next Billy &quot;Crash&quot; Craddock (seriously, listen to the song at number 16).\n\nMark Farner, lead-singer of Grand Funk (at number 11 this week with &quot;Shinin' On&quot;) recently cut his hair (it was so long it was getting caught in the strings of his guitar). When Casey says Farner donated it for a charity auction, he mentions the hair of Telly Savalas who played the bald New York Police Detective &quot;Kojak&quot; from 1973 to 1978. If only Savalas could have detected that someday Michael Chiklis would become the next Telly Savalas.\n\nThe song at number eight, &quot;I'm Leaving It All Up To You&quot; is by Donny &amp; Marie Osmond. Their television show which would debut 16 months later would have over 120 unique guest stars in just 78 episodes. About half way through each show, there was a musical segment where Marie would sing &quot;I'm a little bit country,&quot; then Donny would reply, &quot;And I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll&quot; (but I always felt that if I was given the chance, I could have gotten Marie to change teams).\n\n1974 was not rated &quot;E&quot; for &quot;Everybody&quot; because I remember Underdog's &quot;Super Energy Pill!&quot; He kept it hidden in his flip-top promise ring, and when the withdrawals we're just too much he would say, &quot;The secret compartment of my ring I fill with an 'Underdog super energy pill'.&quot; That sent me down a wayward path in the trailer-park where I heard someone's radio playing Jim Stafford's &quot;Wildwood Weed&quot; (and it was was at number seven).\n\nCasey reports the most number one songs in a single calendar year was 27 (in 1966 and again in 1973). Then he informs us the new number one this week is the 23rd for 1974. But no need to wait till 1975 for a record-breaker because this countdown establishes a new winner for the longest gap between number one hits (during the rock era) by the same artist. For the decade that just went by, Dean Martin could boast of his eight year gap between number one songs. Now, Paul Anka makes it 15 years by putting his hit &quot;(You're) Having My Baby&quot; in the number one spot.\n\n40:    I Love My Friend - Charlie Rich\n39:    I Honestly Love You - Olivia Newton-John\n38:    Free Man In Paris - Joni Mitchell        \n37:    Who Do You Think You Are - Bo Donaldson and The Heywoods     \n36:    Sweet Home Alabama - Lynyrd Skynyrd     \n35:    Don't Change Horses (In The Middle Of The Stream) - The Tower Of Power     \n34:    Time For Lovin' - Sly &amp; The Family Stone\n33:    Another Saturday Night - Cat Stevens\n32:    Radar Love - Golden Earring\n31:    Beach Baby - First Class\n30:    Let's Put It All Together - The Stylistics\n29:    My Thang - James Brown    \n28:    Annie's Song - John Denver\n27:    It's Only Rock Ã¢â‚¬ËœN Roll - The Rolling Stones\n26:    You Haven't Done Nothn' - Stevie Wonder\n25:    Taking Care Of Business - Bachman-Turner Overdrive\n24:    Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me - Elton John\n23:    Sure As I'm Sitting Here - Three Dog Night\n22:    Clap For The Wolfman - The Guess Who\n21:    Hang On In There Baby - Johnny Bristol\n20:    Call On Me - Chicago\n19:    Nothing From Nothing - Billy Preston\n18:    Wild Thing - Fancy\n17:    Then Came You - Dionne Warwick &amp; The Spinners\n16:    Rub It In - Billy &quot;Crash&quot; Craddock\n15:    Can't Get Enough Of Your Love, Babe - Barry White\n14:    Sideshow - Blue Magic\n13:    Please Come To Boston - Dave Loggins\n12:    You And Me Against The World - Helen Reddy\n11:    Shinin' On - Grand Funk\n10:    Keep On Smilin' - Wet Willie\n9:    Rock Me Gently - Andy Kim\n8:    I'm Leaving It All Up To You - Donny &amp; Marie Osmond\n7:    Wildwood Weed - Jim Stafford\n6:    Waterloo - ABBA\n5:    I Shot The Sheriff - Eric Clapton\n4:    Feel Like Makin' Love - Roberta Flack\n3:    Tell Me Something Good - Rufus\n2:    The Night Chicago Died - Paper Lace\n1:    (You're) Having My Baby - Paul Anka\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c3fe8ef3902066b3c35f6012c73bf7432c5cc05","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1974_August_24th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c3fe8ef3902066b3c35f6012c73bf7432c5cc05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,63,232,239,57,2,6,107,60,53,246,1,44,115,191,116,50,197,204,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
