If you played 2160 and didn't like it, don't let that keep you from trying Lost Souls - it's a far superior game in every respect.\n\n\nThe graphics are a little dated, but not terrible, and the game features make up for the dated models:\n\n1. Completely deformable terrain. Build trenches, smooth terrain for building.\n\n2. Tunnels. A layer under the map allows you to build tunnels anywhere for surprise attacks.\n\n3. Highly customizable units. Select the body, weapons, and shields of each of your units. Create massive mobile war platforms.\n\n4. 3 distinct factions with different technology. While some basic weapons are shared, most of it is radically different, especially in the higher tiers. \n\n\n\nThis version is complete, with nothing removed except that it includes only the english install. Movies, soundtrack, etc is all there. A cd key is not required, and it can be installed from your hard drive. Once installed, no cd or iso is required to play.\n\nIncludes manual in PDF form.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e76d0e3debc5140cea51c9028293328264c62198","amp;dn":"Earth+2150%3A+Lost+Souls","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e76d0e3debc5140cea51c9028293328264c62198","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,109,14,61,235,197,20,12,234,81,201,2,130,147,50,130,100,198,33,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
