He reveals for the first time the details of the family's vast political network, which gave it access to and influence over many of the greatest statesmen of the age. And he tells a family saga, tracing the importance of family unity and the profound role of Judaism in the lives of a dynasty that rose from the confines of the Frankfurt ghetto and later used its influence to assist oppressed Jews throughout Europe. A definitive work of impeccable scholarship with a thoroughly engaging narrative, The House of Rothschild is a biography of the rarest kind, in which mysterious and fascinating historical figures finally spring to life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97b1c114f837c0a3d1943b76a5aeb28df872ace1","amp;dn":"The+House+of+Rothschild+-+Money%27s+prophets","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97b1c114f837c0a3d1943b76a5aeb28df872ace1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,177,193,20,248,55,192,163,209,148,59,118,165,174,178,141,248,114,172,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
