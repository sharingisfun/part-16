Now, ancient spirits called the Colossals rise from the debris and attack the remaining survivors, forcing the human race to the brink of extinction. One warrior woman, Maya, sets out to find the last source of pure water to save the world before the monsters bring it all to an end.\n\n\nThanks goes to Tarutaru and theProletariat for these scans.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b2c77d1f0c677afd4b5abc9b53984f4734708a1","amp;dn":"Debris+01-04+%282012%29+%28Complete-1440%26amp%3B2048px-HD%29+%28Novus%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b2c77d1f0c677afd4b5abc9b53984f4734708a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,44,119,209,240,198,119,175,212,181,171,201,181,57,132,244,115,71,8,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
