Philharmonic Chairman Clemens Hellsberg stated that the decision was made &quot;in recognition of our many years of collaboration and PrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªtre's extensive experience with this genre.&quot; The success of PrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªtre's debut at the New Year's Concert 2008 &quot;was for the conductor, the orchestra and the audience very gratifying.&quot; \n\nGeorges PrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªtre has conducted regularly in Vienna for the past 47 years, and his work with the Vienna Philharmonic has encompassed this same time period. Most recently he performed seven concerts with the orchestra in Vienna, Milan, Vaduz, Baden-Baden and Linz. For his artistic achievements, Georges PrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªtre has been honored several times in his home country and also in Austria. In 2004 he was named a Commander of the French Foreign Legion and in the same year was awarded the Austrian Honorary Cross for Science and the Arts, 1st Class. The French president recently designated PrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªtre for the highest honor within the Foreign Legion, the &quot;Grand Officier de la LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©gion d'Honneur&quot;. \nDue to the television and radio broadcasts in more than 70 countries, the New Year's Concert is in terms of its international coverage the largest classical music event in the world. In view of the tradition of the New Year's Concerts, which began during the Second World War, the Vienna Philharmonic performs the concert even today not only as a presentation of Viennese musical culture at the highest level, but also to send the world a New Year's greeting in the spirit of hope, friendship and peace.\n\n\n\nTrack:\n-----------\n\nDVD:\n\n1.
