It is nearly impossible to find torrent files that include all the extras or even important commentaries. \n\nThis is a DVD rip to an ISO so you can watch it on your media player, mount it to a virtual drive or burn it to a DVD.\n\nThis file includes EVERYTHING the original DVD has:\n\n1955\n87 minutes\nBlack and White\n1.33:1\nSpoken Language: Spanish \nSubtitles: English\n\nDirector: \nJuan Antonio Bardem\n\nCast: \nAlberto Closas, Lucia Bose, Carlos Casaravilla, Bruna Corra\n\nDisc Features:\n*New and improved English subtitle translation\n*Calle Bardem (2005), a documentary on the revolutionary life and career of director Juan Antonio Bardem\n\nSYNOPSIS:  \nUpper-class geometry professor Juan and his wealthy, married mistress, Maria Jose, driving back from a late-night rendezvous, accidentally hit a cyclist, and run. The resulting, exquisitely shot tale of guilt, infidelity, and blackmail reveals the wide gap between the rich and the poor in Spain, and surveys the corrupt ethics of a society seduced by decadence. Juan Antonio Bardems charged melodrama Death of a Cyclist (Muerte de un ciclista) was a direct attack on 1950s Spanish society under Francos rule. Though it was affected by the dictates of censorship, its sting could never be dulled.\n\n*** THE BEST WAY TO MESSAGE ME IS TO COMMENT ON MY LATEST UPLOAD, I AM GETTING TOO MANY UP THERE TO MONITOR ALL OF THEM. ***\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ddf5a7de1e3e9096e20ccdc00bc7c4456370089","amp;dn":"Death+of+a+Cyclist+%281955%29+FULL+DVD+%28ISO%29+Criterion+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ddf5a7de1e3e9096e20ccdc00bc7c4456370089","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,223,90,125,225,227,233,9,110,32,204,220,0,188,124,68,86,55,0,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
