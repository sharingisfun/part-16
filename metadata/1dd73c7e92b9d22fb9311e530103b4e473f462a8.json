It was from the first reunion of the band (with new guitarist Dan Toler and bassist David Goldflies) following their 1976 dissolution. The album received strong reviews and moderate sales and was seen as an attempt to return to the dual guitar power of the original lineup. Tom Dowd, who had produced the band's two most successful records in the early 1970s, was brought back to handle production duties. It would also be the last record for Polygram and Capricorn. Capricorn filed for bankruptcy a year later. The band shifted to Arista records for their next release in 1980. &quot;Crazy Love&quot; was the group's second of three Top 40 hits to date.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Crazy Love&quot; (Dickey Betts) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:44\n    &quot;Can't Take It With You&quot; (Betts) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:33\n    &quot;Pegasus&quot; (Betts) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:31\n    &quot;Need Your Love So Bad&quot; (Mertis John Jr.) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:01\n    &quot;Blind Love&quot; (B.B.
