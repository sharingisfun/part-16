It was released in 1978 on the album Jazz. The song was written by Queen guitarist Brian May and was one of the few Queen songs played in an alternative guitar tuning commonly called &quot;drop D tuning&quot;. The lyrics express the axiom &quot;Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder&quot;, albeit done in a humorous and overtly sexual tone.\n\nVocal arrangements are quite different between the studio version and the live version. In live performances, the lead vocals during the chorus were sung by Freddie Mercury and harmonized with an upper voice (Roger Taylor) and a lower voice (Brian May). In the studio version, there is no higher harmony. The lead vocals are sung by Freddie Mercury, while May performs the lower harmony. In the chorus, May has lead vocals.\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6072b9a488555dcc3bfa9e268b9ab0bc52f9a09e","amp;dn":"Queen+-+Fat+Bottom+Girls","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6072b9a488555dcc3bfa9e268b9ab0bc52f9a09e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,114,185,164,136,85,93,204,59,250,158,38,139,154,176,188,82,249,160,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
