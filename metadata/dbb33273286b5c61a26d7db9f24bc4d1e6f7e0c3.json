The congregation in Enfield, Connecticut, where Edwards was a guest preacher, was filled with cries, shrieks, and moaning as people called out, asking how they could be saved. EdwardsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s passionate warning had convinced them that they were desperately close to being thrown into the endless torment of hell. [1]\n\n    To be sure, hearing a sermon preached and reading a book are two different things. However they are not disconnected. For, infallible Scripture says, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFor since, in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom did not know God, it pleased God through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ 1 Corinthians 1:21. Thus human wisdom believes that a) the act of preaching the Gospel is foolishness. And b) the Gospel message is foolishness. Therefore to the unconverted the publishing of Driven by Eternity is a foolish exercise ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a complete waste of a tree!\n\n    The aforementioned ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“foolishnessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ being understood, John Bevere shows his readers Heaven while showing them Hell. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s as if he is saying to the reader, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Look, hereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Heaven and thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Hell,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ as he dangles them over the edge of the fire-filled pit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ perhaps like a turkey roasting on a rotisserie spit. Jonathan Edwards did likewise to a group of church attendees many years before.\n[/size]\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://jesus-talks.com/blogs/blog1.php/creating-an-event-in-heaven&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://jesus-talks.com/blogs/blog1.php/creating-an-event-in-heaven&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nThe Entire POtHS Collection can be found here: \n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was tortured and Murdered for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures.\n\nPraise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. With Repentance I Am Now forgiven for my sins past, present and Future.\n\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn\\'t PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..\n\n\\&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n\\&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the tRUtH.    \n\n\nGet info on the Take Over by The New World Order Below\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://jesus-talks.com/blogs/blog1.php/creating-an-event-in-heaven&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://jesus-talks.com/blogs/blog1.php/creating-an-event-in-heaven&lt;/a&gt;             A place where Jesus would feel at home.
