Motown's first successful female vocal group, the Marvelettes are most notable for recording the company's first #1 Pop hit, &quot;Please Mr. Postman&quot;, and for setting the precedent for later Motown girl groups such as Martha and the Vandellas and the Supremes.\n\nDuring their eight-year run on the Billboard music charts the group scored 21 Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and 23 Billboard Hot 100 hit singles. Of these hits 3 were Top 10 Pop singles, 9 were top Top 10 R&amp;B singles and their debut was #1 one on both charts.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a99cbad8a2ae75aa5b249efe2c4bc462d050a81","amp;dn":"The+Marvelettes-3+cd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a99cbad8a2ae75aa5b249efe2c4bc462d050a81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,153,203,173,138,42,231,90,165,178,73,239,226,196,188,70,45,5,10,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
