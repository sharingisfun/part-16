Easily Abbey's most famous fiction work, the novel concerns the use of sabotage to protest environmentally damaging activities in the American Southwest, and was so influential that the term &quot;monkeywrench&quot; has come to mean, besides sabotage and damage to machines, any sabotage, activism, law-making, or law-breaking to preserve wilderness, wild spaces and ecosystems. In 1985, Dream Garden Press released a special 10th Anniversary edition of the book featuring illustrations by R. Crumb, plus a chapter titled &quot;Seldom Seen at Home&quot; that had been deleted from the original edition.[1] Crumb's illustrations were used for a limited-edition calendar based on the book.[2] The most recent edition was released in 2006 by Harper Perennial Modern Classics.\n\nPlease seed and keep it alive! It's Classic!\n\nIf anyone has Desert Solitaire or any other of Abbey's books, please upload!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fcca160ff1a95c77b61f3cff4e175910ec518cc","amp;dn":"The+Monkey+Wrench+Gang","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fcca160ff1a95c77b61f3cff4e175910ec518cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,204,161,96,255,26,149,199,123,97,243,207,244,225,117,145,14,197,24,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
