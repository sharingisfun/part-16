It was released in October 2008. The first single, &quot;The Shock of the Lightning&quot;, was released on 29 September 2008. In promotion of the album, the band embarked on a world tour, debuting in Seattle, Washington at the WaMu Theater, and continuing for eighteen months. In 2009, the tour concluded (due to Noel Gallagher quitting the band) with major dates at some of the UK's biggest stadiums, notably the new Wembley Stadium, Sunderland's Stadium of Light and Edinburgh's Murrayfield as well as Ireland's Slane Castle. They also performed three hometown shows at Manchester's Heaton Park. To date, Dig Out Your Soul has sold around 5 million copies worldwide.\n\nAlbum Title: Dig Out Your Soul \nArtist | Group: Oasis \nLabel:  Big Brother, Sony BMG (UK), Reprise (North America)\nRelease date: 2008 \nGenre: Alternative rock \nNumber of track(s): 11 \nFile format: mp3 \nTotal duration: 00h:45m:55s:272ms \nTotal size: 105.1597 MB\n\nTrack List:\n\nBag It Up\nThe Turning\nWaiting for the Rapture\nThe Shock of the Lightning\nI'm Outta Time\n(Get Off Your) High Horse Lady\nFalling Down\nTo Be Where There's Life\nAint Got Nothin\nThe Nature of Reality\nSoldier On\n\nENJOY\nplease seed and leave feedback\nvigoni","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a53ffeb5b3023ab2c3b6c35e6918f82501ea083a","amp;dn":"Oasis+-+Dig+Out+Your+Soul+320+kbps+%7Bvigoni%7D+%7BPURE+RG%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a53ffeb5b3023ab2c3b6c35e6918f82501ea083a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,63,254,181,179,2,58,178,195,182,195,94,105,24,248,37,1,234,8,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
