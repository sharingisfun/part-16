It is one of my wife's favorite movies (2nd to &quot;Father of the Bride-part 1&quot; (see my other torrent)).  Unfortunately, it is not available on bluray/hd...and while the 700mb rip suffices for many, I like a little better quality when I'm watching on my 50-inch lcd.  This file may be a little large for some.  But if you aren't worried about space, and want a higher quality, then this is for you.  It is fairly large at 1.7 gb, but still far less than half the size if you were going to keep the original dvr/vob's/iso image.\n\nSource: DVD Rip\nFile Size: 1.7 gb\n\nContainer: MKV\nVideo: x264\nResolution: 720 x 400\n\nAudio 1: English, AAC Dolby Pro Logic II\nAudio 2: French, AAC Dolby Pro Logic II\n\nSubtitles: English srt (in MKV)\n\nHope you enjoy!!\n\nPlease seed when you are done...a good rule of thumb is to upload at least as much as you've downloaded...thanks!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ded8c27b7d0e650386bb495b43448300b39d48b3","amp;dn":"Father.of.the.Bride.2.HQ.DVDrip.x264.AAC.DPLII-MEECH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ded8c27b7d0e650386bb495b43448300b39d48b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,216,194,123,125,14,101,3,134,187,73,91,67,68,131,0,179,157,72,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
