Starting with Batman #1's &quot;The Cat,&quot; Catwoman (aka The Cat, Cat-Woman and just Cat) has become an iconic part of the Gotham universe. Even in the Golden Age, Catwoman was not a pure villain just thieving and stealing at every opportunity. She almost always pulled back from using deadly force and from her start in Batman #1 she had a special attraction to Batman. Likewise, Batman was mesmerized by Catwoman, so much so on several occasions he let her get away and went so far as stopping Robin from chasing her. During DC Comic's Golden Age from 1938 to 1956, Catwoman appeared 19 times, mostly in 2 titles: Batman and Detective Comics. This collection puts all of Catwoman's Golden Age appearances in a single comic archive.\n\nIf you like Catwoman or you want to discover the origin of the oldest, most enduring and iconic female comic anti-hero, give this collection a read. Included in this collection of Golden Age Catwoman stories:\n- Catwoman and Batman's first kiss\n- Batman saving Catwoman's life for the first time\n- Catwoman going to jail multiple times\n- Alfred impersonating Batman and spanking Catwoman\n- Catwoman whips Batman for the first time\n- Catwoman's (first!) origin as a stewardess with amnesia\n- Her retirement and return to crime\n- Catwoman's escape in the Cat-Plane not to be seen for years\n\nThis collection should be comprehensive and it includes several very high quality digital versions of these early comics. For the non-digital comics, several sources were reviewed and the best looking scans selected.
